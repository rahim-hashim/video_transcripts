**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk)
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=0.0s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the, as you [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11.24s)]
*  know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15.22s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17.52s)]
*  in his country. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21.18s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22.82s)]
*  and trade. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28.72s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29.72s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32.36s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34.92s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=37.8s)]
*  dying, young people, mostly soldiers from Russia [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=43.2s)]
*  and Ukraine. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=46.76s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=48.7s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=52.08s)]
*  And I think we've made a lot of progress. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=54.099999999999994s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=57.940000000000005s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=60.78s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=69.22s)]
*  We'll do something. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=72.8s)]
*  the years, the United States has been very good [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=76.7s)]
*  to a lot of people. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=78.64s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=81.1s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=85.64s)]
*  trade, and we've discussed other things also. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=87.48s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=90.66000000000001s)]
*  the way it is. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=93.5s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=94.7s)]
*  Prime Minister Stoltenberg-Holmstead, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  President of the United States [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=96.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=98.66000000000001s)]
*  This year is 200 years since the first immigration [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=99.64s)]
*  from Norway to the U.S. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=101.10000000000001s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=103.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=104.94s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=106.84s)]
*  We are allies. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=109.72s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=110.78s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=113.42s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=117.3s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=121.38s)]
*  to make progress towards something that can be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=124.38s)]
*  a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=127.62s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=130.32s)]
*  will and push. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=132.82s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=134.46s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=136.36s)]
*  have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=138.06s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=143.6s)]
*  by trading, we can be complementary, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  and we can find good solutions. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=151.04s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=153.7s)]
*  the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=155.34s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=157.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=161.44s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=162.94s)]
*  Any questions, please? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=165.68s)]
*  I have a question for you, Mr. President. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=166.82s)]
*  When you spoke about the tariffs that you want [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=169.44000000000003s)]
*  to impose on Norway, is there a chance that you'll [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=171.18s)]
*  lower the tariffs? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  very well. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=178.12s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=178.82000000000002s)]
*  You think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=180.36s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=181.86s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=184.56s)]
*  to Norway? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to President Trump? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=188.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would — I love it. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  I mean, I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  They have. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=196.74s)]
*  I can tell the President that, you know, he is [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  receiving us early in the term. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=203.84s)]
*  strong friendship. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=206.84s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=208.28s)]
*  of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=213.92000000000002s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=218.46s)]
*  may have altered your view on things? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=220.86s)]
*  No, we want to — very simply, I have — [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=224.96s)]
*  no allegiance to anybody. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=228.22s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=229.62s)]
*  save a lot of lives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=232.02s)]
*  A lot of young people — mostly young people. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=232.96s)]
*  It's the war. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=235.3s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=236.66s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=237.7s)]
*  started because the money that's been spent on this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=241.0s)]
*  war is insane. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=244.1s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=245.44s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=247.04s)]
*  President. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=248.48s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=249.84s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=256.76s)]
*  And then I looked at — and I see the results. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=258.7s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=260.94s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=262.7s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week, on average. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=264.2s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=267.14s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=269.72s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=272.34000000000003s)]
*  Why do you think — [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=275.12s)]
*  Do you think Russia — that you will get Russia to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=276.42s)]
*  accept a deal that also Ukraine and Europe is [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=280.42s)]
*  willing to accept? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  I think so. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=285.46000000000004s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=286.24s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=288.74s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=290.54s)]
*  Soon. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=291.20000000000005s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=291.88000000000005s)]
*  your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=300.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=302.78000000000003s)]
*  that's for another day. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=304.36s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=306.12s)]
*  What are you expecting of your allies? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=308.06s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=309.16s)]
*  threat to our world. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  international peace. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=314.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=315.41999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a truth-social [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=316.26s)]

*  Vladimir, stop. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  a personal message. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=326.0s)]
*  Putin? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=328.29999999999995s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=328.96s)]

*  That's what I meant. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's — [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=339.08s)]
*  If the President — [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=340.97999999999996s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=342.28s)]
*  Sorry? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=344.17999999999995s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=345.02s)]
*  additional sanctions toward Russia? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=348.08s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=349.61999999999995s)]
*  respond? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=352.56s)]

*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=356.02s)]

*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=361.55999999999995s)]
*  pressure on Russia? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=363.5s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans — [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=364.7s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=366.05999999999995s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=366.96s)]
*  Russia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=368.34s)]
*  They're dealing — you have no idea what pressure [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=369.0s)]
*  I'm putting on Russia. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=371.2s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=371.94s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us a little bit about the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=373.48s)]
*  kind of pressure you're putting on Russia? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=374.94s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=375.94s)]
*  And Russia knows that, and some people that are [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=377.28s)]
*  close to it know — or he wouldn't be talking [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=379.32s)]
*  right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=381.16s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=382.58s)]
*  than anybody. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=384.32s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=384.98s)]
*  He's talking. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=386.26s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=387.56s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=388.8s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=390.0s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=391.3s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=394.1s)]
*  deal, too. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=396.84s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=399.46s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=401.84s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, if I may. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=404.23999999999995s)]
*  You've said that it's — that the Ukraine have to [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=406.91999999999996s)]
*  give some territory to win peace, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=412.17999999999995s)]
*  among them Crimea. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=415.06s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=416.46s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=417.96s)]
*  today has told you that he does not agree, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=423.26s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=425.76s)]
*  the Ukraine. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=429.29999999999995s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=430.44s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine have to give [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  Ukraine that — [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=434.73999999999995s)]
*  The former — former Secretary General happens [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=435.47999999999996s)]
*  to be right here, you know. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=436.5s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=438.67999999999995s)]
*  He's a — he's been a great — he's been a great [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=440.44s)]
*  general, frankly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=444.44s)]
*  It was — because that's what you are. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=445.41999999999996s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=446.88s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=448.35999999999996s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=450.02s)]
*  Very successful. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=451.97999999999996s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=453.62s)]
*  He's right here. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=456.09999999999997s)]
*  So do you still agree that Ukraine have to give [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=457.1s)]
*  some territory away to win peace? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=460.24s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=463.54s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=465.04s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=465.84000000000003s)]
*  And we'll get — we'll do the best we can. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=467.88s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=470.04s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=472.92s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=478.52000000000004s)]
*  That was — had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=481.26000000000005s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=483.42s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=487.16s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=489.8s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=491.0s)]
*  There was no anything. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=492.34000000000003s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=493.1s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=494.04s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=497.06s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=500.04s)]
*  President, not by Donald Trump. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=503.40000000000003s)]
*  The Press Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=505.04s)]
*  I had a long meeting with the President. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=506.04s)]
*  The Press Thank you for the peace proposal that you [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=508.04s)]
*  put on the table. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=509.04s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=510.02000000000004s)]
*  The National Security Team presented it to both [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=511.34s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=513.74s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=515.34s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=518.8199999999999s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=521.18s)]
*  based upon that — just getting to that 30-day [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=524.72s)]
*  ceasefire? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=526.96s)]
*  The President I don't think so. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=528.12s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=529.12s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=530.86s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=532.86s)]
*  Complicated. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=534.0s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=535.14s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=536.1s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=540.0600000000001s)]
*  Secretary General Barroso Well, first of all, what was [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=541.1s)]
*  put before our partners was options to discuss about [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=543.04s)]
*  things that it would take to end a war. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=545.84s)]
*  This war is endable. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=548.08s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=549.34s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=551.34s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=552.34s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=553.34s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=554.34s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=556.34s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=557.34s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=558.72s)]
*  strikes should remind everybody of why this war [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=560.72s)]
*  needs to end. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=562.72s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=563.72s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=564.72s)]
*  were alive yesterday that are not alive today [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=566.72s)]
*  because this war continues and the president wants [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=568.78s)]
*  to stop it. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=570.88s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=571.68s)]
*  being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=573.58s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=575.38s)]

*  towards an end of this war, U.S. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=689.74s)]

*  possible. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=694.88s)]

*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=699.4200000000001s)]
*  know that they have to deliver and they have to [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=702.0600000000001s)]

*  ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=716.76s)]
*  some time ago. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=719.34s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=720.0s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=722.1800000000001s)]
*  parties can own. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=724.34s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=725.44s)]
*  And here, I believe, Europeans and Americans [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=730.08s)]
*  working together, as we do much closer now — and I [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=732.1800000000001s)]
*  salute the team of President Trump of being [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=735.46s)]
*  open in that process. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=738.1s)]

*  And then we have to move on. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=741.16s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=742.76s)]
*  drama happening. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=745.4599999999999s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=746.16s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe and it's a bad thing [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=748.06s)]
*  for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=751.4s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=754.8s)]
*  Mr. President, I have a follow-up question. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=758.4399999999999s)]
*  Sir, Mr. President, if — I forgot my question. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=760.9799999999999s)]
*  I wanted to ask about — [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=767.9s)]
*  All right. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=769.9399999999999s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=770.84s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=771.74s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the — [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=773.04s)]
*  well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=777.18s)]
*  Patriot missiles. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=780.52s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=782.68s)]
*  States. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=785.46s)]
*  If you — and the United States decides to pull out [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=786.72s)]
*  of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=789.56s)]
*  does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, a no [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=792.8s)]
*  on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=796.44s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=799.72s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=800.6800000000001s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=802.46s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=804.08s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=806.22s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=810.0s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=812.42s)]
*  hopefully not have to answer that question. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=815.4s)]
*  You said once the President — [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=817.2s)]
*  If the President — [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=818.2s)]
*  Norway is the third country to be officially [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=819.94s)]
*  invited to the White House after the relation day. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=822.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=826.84s)]
*  Because I like them. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=830.28s)]

*  way your government runs. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=834.64s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=837.14s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=839.68s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=841.38s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=842.08s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=845.12s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=846.46s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=847.12s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=849.92s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=850.7s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=852.48s)]
*  President Trump, I just want to inform you that you [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=855.16s)]
*  said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=858.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=862.8s)]
*  today, the way that we have structured our economy and [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=865.8s)]
*  what our — [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=870.0s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=871.0799999999999s)]
*  for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=875.88s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=879.5799999999999s)]
*  dedicate it, innovate, and move forward despite having [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=882.52s)]
*  these incomes, which we happen to be in the period [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=885.8199999999999s)]
*  of our history where we can harvest, and we have [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  transferred that into investments, half of them, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=891.12s)]
*  by the way, here in the United States. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=893.56s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=895.8199999999999s)]
*  explore if we can share experiences, and we do with [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=899.12s)]
*  our colleagues in the U.S. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=902.3s)]
*  You never copy this one-to-one, but there can be [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=904.9s)]
*  techniques and way of working that we have used in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=909.46s)]
*  organizing our fund. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister when the [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=916.22s)]
*  first dollar entered that fund, so he is a safe hand [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=918.4200000000001s)]
*  to have as a finance minister today. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=922.46s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=924.5s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=925.34s)]
*  to sit down with the U.S. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=928.44s)]
*  to also work with them if they want to establish [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=930.0400000000001s)]
*  some wealth fund, because we have a good experience [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=932.98s)]
*  with our fund. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=935.2800000000001s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=936.7s)]
*  with the United States is that half the fund, [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=940.18s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=943.24s)]
*  in the United States, mainly in equity, but also [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=946.98s)]
*  some in fixed income, including government funds. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=950.34s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=953.26s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=958.18s)]
*  sovereign wealth fund. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=960.0600000000001s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=961.26s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=964.22s)]
*  Ukraine, the path forward to peace, and as the [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=966.58s)]
*  prime minister said, we commend the U.S. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=969.5s)]
*  for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=971.86s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=975.5s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=978.9s)]
*  tripled the military support to Ukraine, and this year [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=981.78s)]
*  we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=985.78s)]
*  to Ukraine, that will strengthen them and also [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=989.3000000000001s)]
*  their hand on the negotiating table. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=991.58s)]
*  So I may add to that, if there's a peace, and there [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=993.34s)]
*  will be a peace, we have a common responsibility [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=995.42s)]
*  in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=998.26s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1000.74s)]
*  is the ability to defend themselves, and we are [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1003.3s)]
*  investing in that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1005.42s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1006.26s)]
*  Mr. President, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1007.38s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1010.58s)]
*  the 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway was 15%, based [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1013.86s)]
*  upon your conversations that you've had today [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  with the Prime Minister. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1021.66s)]
*  Do you see that tariff rate coming down from what [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1022.58s)]
*  you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1025.78s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1028.62s)]
*  It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1032.38s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1036.06s)]
*  more than that, I hope. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1038.22s)]
*  Are the two nations in agreement on which countries? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1039.58s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1042.18s)]
*  Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1044.9s)]
*  of Crimea. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1048.14s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1049.22s)]
*  administration changed its stance on territorial [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1051.54s)]
*  concessions in Crimea? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1054.3s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1056.02s)]
*  It would have never started if I were President. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1057.02s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible — a horrible — [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1059.14s)]
*  all wars are horrible. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1062.38s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1063.38s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1065.94s)]
*  going to be a winner to this because so many lives [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1068.98s)]
*  have been lost. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1072.02s)]
*  Not only soldiers. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1073.1000000000001s)]
*  A lot of lives have been lost. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1074.02s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1076.98s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were President. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1081.5800000000002s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to — and it didn't. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1083.7s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1086.14s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1087.46s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1088.7s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1090.22s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1091.54s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1092.74s)]
*  But we never — there was never even a thought [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1095.7s)]
*  that he'd go in. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1098.46s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1099.66s)]
*  happy if he did. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1102.5s)]
*  And it was only when I got out — and, you know, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1103.5800000000002s)]
*  when you mention what happened to Ukraine years [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1106.42s)]
*  ago under President Obama and a vice president [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1109.6200000000001s)]
*  that was also president later, unfortunately, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1112.8600000000001s)]
*  for this country. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1116.02s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1117.3000000000002s)]
*  given up and it was called Crimea. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1120.98s)]
*  And that was a big — that was a big thing. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1124.3000000000002s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1125.94s)]
*  But this isn't my war. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1127.8600000000001s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1129.8600000000001s)]
*  This is a war that — Biden was president when [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1131.14s)]
*  this war happened. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1135.42s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1136.8200000000002s)]
*  we'll be successful. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1139.1000000000001s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1140.0600000000002s)]
*  Otherwise — and the Prime Minister had a statement. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1142.18s)]
*  He said, this is just a point in time. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1144.7800000000002s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1147.6200000000001s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1149.3400000000001s)]
*  for a long time. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1151.8200000000002s)]
*  The Press. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1153.2600000000002s)]
*  Will you have meetings with other world leaders [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1154.0600000000002s)]
*  here in Rome, sir? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1156.18s)]
*  The Press. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1157.3400000000001s)]
*  Will you have a future Democrat president? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1158.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1160.5800000000002s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1161.38s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1163.98s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1165.8200000000002s)]
*  But we're going to — we're going to know pretty soon. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1167.42s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have meetings with other [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1169.38s)]
*  world leaders when you're in Rome? [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1174.1000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1175.5s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1176.46s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1179.06s)]
*  That would be nice. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1180.5s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1182.02s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1183.3400000000001s)]
*  to meet. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1185.9s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1186.66s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1188.5800000000002s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1192.74s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1194.98s)]
*  the Republic of South Korea today. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1197.78s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1200.74s)]
*  be talking technical terms as early as next week, as [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1205.22s)]
*  we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1209.06s)]
*  next week. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1212.02s)]
*  So South Koreans came early, they came with their [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1212.7s)]
*  A game, and we will see if they follow through on that. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1216.02s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve this [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1219.94s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prize if you manage to create it? [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1224.94s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1226.94s)]
*  If you manage to create it. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1228.94s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1229.94s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1231.94s)]
*  they say for the Abraham Accords. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1234.4199999999998s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1236.52s)]
*  filling it up. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1238.32s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1239.28s)]
*  Accords. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1241.4199999999998s)]
*  You know, we have four. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1242.1s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1243.3s)]
*  It's the same four. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1246.1s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1247.8999999999999s)]
*  doing it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1249.7199999999998s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1250.3999999999999s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1251.6s)]
*  Accords. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1253.6999999999998s)]
*  You're going to be, I think, filling it up very [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1254.36s)]
*  rapidly. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1257.24s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1257.8999999999999s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to to grow the [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1260.5s)]
*  Abraham Accords. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1263.04s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing of all the [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1263.74s)]
*  leaders in the world today. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1265.8999999999999s)]
*  No leader is working harder to prevent wars or end [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1266.84s)]
*  them than President Trump is right now. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1269.58s)]
*  We're trying. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1271.8799999999999s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1272.54s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1273.4199999999998s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1275.8s)]
*  out and to end the ones that exist already. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1277.94s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1279.94s)]
*  country to be led by a president who desires to [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1282.32s)]
*  bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1285.3799999999999s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1287.98s)]
*  Mr. President, Marco just mentioned something that [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1289.96s)]
*  maybe we should talk about for just a second and we [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1295.1s)]
*  could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1298.16s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1299.3s)]
*  involved in the world and peace. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1301.26s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1304.06s)]
*  Iran and we're having very serious meetings. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1306.84s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1311.94s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1313.8999999999999s)]
*  It's not a not a good option at all. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1316.44s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1320.08s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1323.92s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1325.1599999999999s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1328.26s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1331.42s)]
*  of lives will be saved. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1334.66s)]
*  The Press. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1336.22s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1337.0600000000002s)]
*  slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1340.66s)]
*  March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1343.94s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1347.0800000000002s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1348.7s)]
*  this as well. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1350.98s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1351.64s)]
*  about the broader U.S. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1354.38s)]
*  economy? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1355.5400000000002s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1356.22s)]
*  Extremely good numbers. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1357.7800000000002s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1359.46s)]
*  if you look at what happened, everyone said, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1362.4s)]
*  oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1364.14s)]
*  I did. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1366.44s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1367.2s)]
*  It's way down. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  Energy is down. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1372.3200000000002s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1373.0800000000002s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1376.0800000000002s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1379.88s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1386.18s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1390.42s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1392.1200000000001s)]
*  complaining about eggs. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1395.8600000000001s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1397.46s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1398.72s)]
*  when the — when the press started saying about eggs. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1400.8600000000001s)]
*  I've gone through the roof. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1403.5600000000002s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1404.46s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1405.5s)]
*  And they happened. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1406.8400000000001s)]
*  They were — they went through the roof and you [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1407.6000000000001s)]
*  couldn't get them. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1409.1000000000001s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1410.18s)]
*  House. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1413.8s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1414.3999999999999s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1416.54s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1419.2s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1421.1399999999999s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1423.34s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1424.82s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1425.98s)]
*  That's a smart thing to do. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1427.44s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1428.72s)]
*  Although, already, it's a little bit late. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1429.62s)]
*  But, in the end, we just have a great country. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1431.92s)]
*  We have a very strong country. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1434.46s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1435.72s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1437.72s)]
*  to negotiate a deal. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1439.7s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1441.8799999999999s)]
*  we think is fair. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1445.2199999999998s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1446.6799999999998s)]
*  it would be physically impossible. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1449.3799999999999s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1451.4199999999998s)]
*  understand it, which is a very small group of people [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1452.9599999999998s)]
*  here. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1456.0s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1457.1s)]
*  for deals. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1461.1999999999998s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1462.6999999999998s)]
*  Some treat it as very unfairly. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1464.84s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1466.6s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1468.9799999999998s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1471.06s)]
*  country, probably, in the history of the world has [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1473.04s)]
*  been ripped off — for 45, 50 years. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1475.1s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1478.7s)]
*  United States. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1482.18s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1483.04s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1484.68s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1486.88s)]
*  deals. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1488.68s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1489.78s)]
*  do, where we virtually take care of their military [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1492.32s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1494.96s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1497.06s)]
*  countries. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1499.52s)]
*  I don't blame the people that sat at that beautiful [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1500.28s)]
*  desk right behind you, because those people didn't [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  do the job for this country. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1505.8600000000001s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1507.9s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1512.7s)]
*  I got here. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1515.56s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1516.7s)]
*  even. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1519.8s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1520.78s)]

*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1524.42s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1528.1200000000001s)]
*  We were abused by countries. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1529.36s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1531.3999999999999s)]
*  happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1534.1399999999999s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1537.04s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1538.24s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1540.18s)]
*  our country my first term. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1542.48s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1544.68s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1546.24s)]
*  of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1548.72s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1551.02s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other President. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1552.46s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1555.48s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1558.76s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=1562.3200000000002s)]

*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2281.54s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2287.6s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2293.32s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2299.8s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement in every respect. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2302.6800000000003s)]
*  The war is very important. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2306.96s)]
*  It ends with — I used to say 2,500 people a week dying — young people, mostly soldiers [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2307.96s)]
*  from Russia and Ukraine. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2315.96s)]
*  And we want to — we want to end that war. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2319.2400000000002s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2322.2400000000002s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2324.44s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2326.88s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2328.2400000000002s)]
*  We're going to see what the next few years are taking place right now. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2331.28s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2334.28s)]
*  well on trade. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2340.6800000000003s)]
*  We'll do something. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2341.6800000000003s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2342.6800000000003s)]
*  very good to a lot of — a lot of people. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2348.32s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2351.52s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2355.96s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2358.2000000000003s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you, the way it is. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2361.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2364.64s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2365.64s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2367.28s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2373.68s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2375.2s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2377.08s)]
*  We are allies. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2379.96s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2381.0s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2383.68s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2387.48s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2391.48s)]
*  be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2397.6s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2400.56s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2404.84s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2406.64s)]
*  on trade. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2411.84s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2413.72s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2419.4399999999996s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2421.56s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2423.7599999999998s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2427.64s)]

*  Yes. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2435.6s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2436.6s)]
*  Is there a chance that you will... [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2443.2799999999997s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2444.52s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2448.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2450.24s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2451.56s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2454.52s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit to President Trump's Norway? [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2458.36s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2460.7599999999998s)]
*  I love it. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2461.96s)]
*  I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2463.32s)]
*  They have... [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2466.4s)]
*  I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2467.4s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2471.28s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2472.28s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2473.28s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2478.28s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2488.6000000000004s)]
*  No, we want to... [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2494.6000000000004s)]
*  Very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2496.1200000000003s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2499.84s)]
*  A lot of young people's... [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  Mostly young people. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2504.4s)]
*  It's the war. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2505.4s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2506.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2508.1200000000003s)]
*  spent on this war is insane. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2513.1200000000003s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2515.7200000000003s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were President. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2517.52s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2520.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2527.04s)]
*  And then I looked at... [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2529.04s)]
*  And I see the results. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2530.04s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2531.04s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2532.04s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2538.96s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2539.96s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2542.64s)]
*  Do you think that Russia... [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2546.2400000000002s)]
*  That people get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2548.2400000000002s)]
*  accept? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2555.1200000000003s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2556.1200000000003s)]
*  I do. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2557.1200000000003s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2558.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2559.1200000000003s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2560.6800000000003s)]
*  Soon. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2561.6800000000003s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2562.6800000000003s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2570.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2573.08s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2576.2799999999997s)]
*  What are you expecting from your ally? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2578.12s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2579.12s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2583.04s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2585.48s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2586.48s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2592.12s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2596.52s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2598.64s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2600.04s)]
*  We're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2602.12s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2606.6s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2608.04s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's... [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2609.04s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm quiet. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2610.04s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2611.04s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2612.04s)]
*  Yeah, I assume. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2613.04s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2614.04s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2619.7999999999997s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2622.44s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2624.24s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2626.24s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2628.6s)]
*  Things will happen. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2629.6s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2631.12s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans... [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2634.12s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2635.12s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2636.12s)]
*  They're dealing. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2639.12s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2640.12s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2642.12s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2643.12s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2644.12s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2647.12s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2648.12s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2652.12s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2655.12s)]
*  He's talking. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2656.12s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2657.12s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2659.12s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2660.64s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2661.64s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2664.64s)]
*  They're being hit very hard. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2667.64s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2669.64s)]
*  Mr. President, you said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2672.64s)]
*  them Crimea. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2685.64s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2686.64s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2688.16s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2695.16s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2700.16s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give? [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2702.16s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2705.16s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2708.16s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2711.16s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2716.16s)]
*  You're a general. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2717.68s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2718.68s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2719.68s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2723.68s)]
*  He's right here. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2726.68s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2727.68s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2733.68s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2734.68s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2735.68s)]
*  And we'll get, we'll do the best we can. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2737.68s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2740.68s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2743.68s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2745.2s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2751.2s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2753.2s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2757.2s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2760.2s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2761.2s)]
*  There was no anything. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2762.2s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2763.2s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2764.2s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2767.2s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2770.72s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2775.72s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a new peace proposal that you put on the table. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2776.72s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2779.72s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2781.72s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2785.72s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2789.72s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, just getting to [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2791.72s)]
*  that 30-day ceasefire? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2796.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2797.72s)]
*  They both want peace right now. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2800.24s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2801.24s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2802.24s)]
*  Complicated. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2803.24s)]
*  Very complicated. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2804.24s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2805.24s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2810.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2811.24s)]
*  that it would take to end a war. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2816.24s)]
*  This war is endable. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2818.24s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2819.24s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2821.24s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2822.24s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2823.24s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2824.24s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2826.24s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2827.24s)]
*  What happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  war needs to end. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2832.7599999999998s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2834.7599999999998s)]
*  today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2838.7599999999998s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2841.7599999999998s)]
*  lives. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2845.7599999999998s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2846.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, but we're trying to end the dying. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2847.7599999999998s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2850.7599999999998s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2853.7599999999998s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2855.7599999999998s)]
*  We can to help them get there, but they have to ultimately say yes. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2859.28s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2861.28s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2863.28s)]
*  people, but we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2867.28s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2869.28s)]
*  has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2874.28s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2880.28s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2882.28s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2885.28s)]
*  Mr. President, if you are going to take down the terrorists, what do you want Norway to [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2887.8s)]
*  buy more of from the U.S.? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2894.8s)]
*  To buy more? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2897.8s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2899.8s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2901.8s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2903.8s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2905.8s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2907.8s)]
*  We've had a great relationship. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2910.8s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2912.8s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2917.32s)]
*  You can't do better. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2919.32s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2920.32s)]
*  Not even by, say, five minutes? [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2921.32s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2923.32s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2926.32s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2927.32s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2928.32s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, if I can ask both [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2931.32s)]
*  you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2935.32s)]
*  Totally. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2940.32s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2941.32s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2943.84s)]
*  dying more than anything else. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2948.84s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2950.84s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2952.84s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2954.84s)]
*  and President Trump made that possible. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2963.84s)]
*  That is clear. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2965.84s)]
*  That is obvious. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2966.84s)]
*  It's really happening. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2967.84s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver and [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2969.36s)]
*  they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2973.36s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2976.36s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2979.36s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2981.36s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2983.36s)]
*  the U.S. some time ago. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2988.36s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2990.36s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2992.36s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2995.88s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=2999.88s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3004.88s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3008.88s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3010.88s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3012.88s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3015.88s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3017.88s)]
*  conflict going on. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3022.88s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3025.4s)]
*  Mr. President, follow up on China. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3028.4s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3031.4s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3036.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3038.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3040.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3042.4s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3044.4s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3047.4s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3052.92s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3056.92s)]
*  peace, does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3061.92s)]
*  Ukraine? [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3067.92s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3069.92s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3070.92s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3072.92s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3074.92s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks and we'll see. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3076.92s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3080.44s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3082.44s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3087.44s)]
*  after Liberation Day. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3094.44s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3096.44s)]
*  Because I like them. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3100.44s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3102.44s)]
*  And I like the way your government runs. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3104.44s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3106.44s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3108.96s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3110.96s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3111.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3113.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3115.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3119.96s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3120.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3122.96s)]
*  President Trump, first of all, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3124.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and what our goals are. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3133.48s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3141.48s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward despite having these incomes, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3149.48s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3158.0s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3166.0s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3170.0s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and a way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3174.0s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3184.52s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3190.52s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3194.52s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3196.52s)]
*  to also work with them if they want to establish a wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3200.52s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half of the fund [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3206.52s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3213.04s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government bonds. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3220.04s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the wealth fund. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3224.04s)]
*  Then just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3231.04s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3237.56s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3243.56s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3249.56s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3255.56s)]
*  that will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3260.56s)]
*  And I may add to that, if there is a peace, and there will be a peace, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3264.08s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3267.08s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3271.08s)]
*  and we are investing in that. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3275.08s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3277.08s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway was 15%, [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3281.08s)]
*  based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3288.08s)]
*  Do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3293.6s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion, it's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3298.6s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3305.6s)]
*  Are you talking about the agreement of which country? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3309.6s)]
*  Mr. President, 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3312.6s)]
*  Why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3320.12s)]
*  Well, the war started, it would have never started if I were President. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3326.12s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible, horrible. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3329.12s)]
*  All wars are horrible, this one is in particular bad, [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3332.12s)]
*  and I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3336.12s)]
*  because so many lives have been lost, not only soldiers, a lot of lives have been lost. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3340.12s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3346.64s)]
*  it would have never happened if I were President, zero chance it was going to happen, and it didn't. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3351.64s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3356.64s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen, we never even discussed it. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3357.64s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it, it was the apple of his eye. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3360.64s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3363.64s)]
*  but there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3366.64s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3369.64s)]
*  And it was only when I got out, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3374.16s)]
*  and you know, when you mention what happened to Ukraine [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3376.16s)]
*  years ago under President Obama, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3379.16s)]
*  and a Vice President that was also President later, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3382.16s)]
*  unfortunately for this country, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3385.16s)]
*  what happened is large chunks of lead were given up, [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3387.16s)]
*  and it was called Crimea, and that was a big thing, that was a big moment. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3392.16s)]
*  But this isn't my war, this is Biden's war. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3398.16s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was President when this war happened, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3401.68s)]
*  but I'm trying to put out the fire, and I think we'll be successful, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3406.68s)]
*  and if we do we're going to save a lot of lives. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3410.68s)]
*  Otherwise, and the Prime Minister had a statement, he said, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3412.68s)]
*  this is just a point in time, we're very lucky because this is a point, [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3415.68s)]
*  and if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3419.68s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have meetings with other world leaders in here and grow? [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3423.68s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3428.2s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3431.2s)]
*  I think he wants to end it, and I feel pretty confident of that, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3434.2s)]
*  but we're going to know pretty soon. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3437.2s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3440.2s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3445.2s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3447.2s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3449.2s)]
*  That would be nice, I'd like to take care of all of them, [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3451.2s)]
*  but we have many of them there, and they all want to meet. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3454.2s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3457.72s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3462.72s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3465.72s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3469.72s)]
*  and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3473.72s)]
*  as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3478.72s)]
*  So South Koreans came early, they came with their A game, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3482.72s)]
*  and we will see if they follow through on that. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3487.24s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you manage to create it? [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3490.24s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3497.24s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3499.24s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3502.24s)]
*  but they say for the Abraham Accords, [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3504.24s)]
*  and by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3506.24s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3509.24s)]
*  You know we have four, and Biden did nothing on that one too. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3512.24s)]
*  It's the same four, but they're great countries, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3516.7599999999998s)]
*  and they were brave doing it, and it's worked out very well. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3518.7599999999998s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3521.7599999999998s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3524.7599999999998s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3527.7599999999998s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3528.7599999999998s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3530.7599999999998s)]
*  but I would just point to one thing. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3533.7599999999998s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3535.7599999999998s)]
*  no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3537.7599999999998s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3541.7599999999998s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3543.7599999999998s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3546.28s)]
*  and to end the ones that exist already. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3548.28s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3550.28s)]
*  to be led by a President who desires to bring peace [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3553.28s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3556.28s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3558.28s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3560.28s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3562.28s)]
*  talk about for just a second if we could, Mr. Prime Minister, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3566.28s)]
*  and you're involved in it too because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3569.28s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3574.8s)]
*  and we're having very serious meetings. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3577.8s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3580.8s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3583.8s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3586.8s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3589.8s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3594.8s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3597.8s)]
*  And I think we could have a very, very good decision [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3602.32s)]
*  and a lot of lives will be saved. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3605.32s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3608.32s)]
*  as it relates to home sales in the month of March, [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3611.32s)]
*  the slowest pace since 2009. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3614.32s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3617.32s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3619.32s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3622.32s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3626.32s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3629.84s)]
*  if you look at what happened, everyone said, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3632.84s)]
*  oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3634.84s)]
*  I did. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3636.84s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3637.84s)]
*  It's way down. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3640.84s)]
*  Energy is down. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3642.84s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3643.84s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3645.84s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3649.84s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3652.84s)]
*  and for Americans who also agree with solving the war problem. [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3657.36s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3660.36s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3662.36s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3667.36s)]
*  I've been here for, I was here for about a week when the press started saying [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3669.36s)]
*  about eggs have gone through the roof. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3673.36s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3675.36s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3676.36s)]
*  And they happened. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3677.36s)]
*  They went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3678.36s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3680.36s)]
*  We had thousands and thousands of eggs and the price was down 87 percent. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3684.88s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3688.88s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3690.88s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3692.88s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3694.88s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3695.88s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3697.88s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3698.88s)]
*  Although already it's a little bit late. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3699.88s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3701.88s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3705.88s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3707.88s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3712.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3716.4s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3719.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3721.4s)]
*  small group of people here. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3725.4s)]
*  And we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3727.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3732.4s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3734.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3736.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3738.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3741.92s)]
*  world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3744.92s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3748.92s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3752.92s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3754.92s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3756.92s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3759.92s)]
*  the military and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3763.92s)]
*  So the people. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3766.92s)]
*  And I don't blame those countries. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3768.92s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3770.44s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3773.44s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3777.44s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3782.44s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3786.44s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3790.44s)]
*  So, but I don't blame any country. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3794.44s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3798.44s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3799.96s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3801.96s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3806.96s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3807.96s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3809.96s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3813.96s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3815.96s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3820.96s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3822.96s)]
*  They, but not only China, virtually every country got away with murder. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3826.48s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=3832.48s)]

*  We have also alluded to the president for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4663.0s)]
*  And an end to this terrible conflict. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4669.0s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4671.0s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4675.0s)]

*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4708.52s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4713.52s)]
*  We spoke about trade. [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4715.52s)]

*  Did you too discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4729.040000000001s)]
*  We didn't, but I love it. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4731.040000000001s)]

*  And I told the president that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4737.040000000001s)]

*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4745.040000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4748.56s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4758.56s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4765.56s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4770.56s)]
*  And I want to save a lot of lives. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4772.56s)]
*  A lot of young people, mostly young people. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4774.56s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4777.080000000001s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4779.080000000001s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4786.080000000001s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were president. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4788.080000000001s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4790.080000000001s)]
*  And it's a shame. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4794.080000000001s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4796.080000000001s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4798.080000000001s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4801.080000000001s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4803.080000000001s)]
*  We have 5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4805.6s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4807.6s)]
*  We both want to stop that. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4809.6s)]
*  For a lot of reasons. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4811.6s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4813.6s)]
*  Do you think you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe will accept? [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4815.6s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4825.6s)]
*  I do. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4827.6s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4829.6s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4831.6s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4834.120000000001s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4840.120000000001s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4843.120000000001s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4846.120000000001s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4849.120000000001s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4853.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4856.120000000001s)]

*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4862.64s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4866.64s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4869.64s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4870.64s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4872.64s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4876.64s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4878.64s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's like. [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4880.64s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4882.64s)]
*  Yeah, I assume. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4884.64s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4886.64s)]
*  What will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4891.160000000001s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4893.160000000001s)]

*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4897.160000000001s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4899.160000000001s)]
*  Things will happen. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4901.160000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4903.160000000001s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4905.160000000001s)]

*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4915.160000000001s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4917.160000000001s)]
*  I think that some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4919.68s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4921.68s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4923.68s)]
*  He's talking and we're putting a lot of pressure. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4925.68s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4927.68s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4929.68s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4931.68s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4933.68s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4935.68s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4937.68s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4939.68s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4941.68s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4943.68s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4945.68s)]
*  You said that the Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4948.200000000001s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4956.200000000001s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4958.200000000001s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4966.200000000001s)]
*  How do you deal with that with your allies? [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4970.200000000001s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Crimea the Ukraine? [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4972.200000000001s)]
*  The former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4974.72s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4978.72s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4980.72s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4984.72s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4986.72s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4988.72s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4990.72s)]
*  Very successful. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4992.72s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4994.72s)]
*  He's right here. [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4996.72s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=4998.72s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5003.240000000001s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5005.240000000001s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5007.240000000001s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5009.240000000001s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5011.240000000001s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5013.240000000001s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5015.240000000001s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5021.240000000001s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5023.240000000001s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5027.240000000001s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5029.240000000001s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5031.76s)]
*  There was no anything. [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5033.76s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5035.76s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5037.76s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5039.76s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5041.76s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5045.76s)]
*  I had a long meeting with the President. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5047.76s)]
*  The 30-day ceasefire proposal, your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5049.76s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5055.76s)]
*  But immediately, Russia has not. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5060.280000000001s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that? [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5062.280000000001s)]
*  Just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5066.280000000001s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5068.280000000001s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5070.280000000001s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5072.280000000001s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5074.280000000001s)]
*  Complicated, very complicated. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5076.280000000001s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5078.280000000001s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5080.280000000001s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5082.280000000001s)]
*  This war is endable. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5088.8s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5089.8s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5091.8s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5093.8s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5095.8s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5097.8s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5099.8s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5101.8s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5103.8s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5105.8s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5107.8s)]
*  And the President wants to stop it. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5109.8s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the President for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5111.8s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5115.8s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5118.320000000001s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5120.320000000001s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5122.320000000001s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5124.320000000001s)]
*  We can see the finish line. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5126.320000000001s)]
*  But both of them have to get there. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5128.320000000001s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5130.320000000001s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5132.320000000001s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5134.320000000001s)]
*  If you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5136.320000000001s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5138.320000000001s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to stop the war? [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5140.320000000001s)]
*  To get to the point where you're closer to peace. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5148.320000000001s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5150.320000000001s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5152.320000000001s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5154.320000000001s)]
*  Mr. President. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5156.320000000001s)]
*  If you are going to take out the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the US? [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5158.320000000001s)]
*  To buy more? [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5168.320000000001s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5170.320000000001s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5172.320000000001s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5174.320000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of them. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5176.84s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5178.84s)]
*  We've had a great relationship. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5180.84s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5182.84s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5184.84s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5186.84s)]
*  You can't do better. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5188.84s)]
*  Really? [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5190.84s)]
*  If they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5192.84s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5194.84s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5196.84s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5198.84s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5200.84s)]
*  But on the Ukraine, if I can ask, what is the best way to do that? [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5202.84s)]
*  If I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on the Ukraine and the peace plan? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5205.360000000001s)]
*  Totally. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5211.360000000001s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5213.360000000001s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5215.360000000001s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5221.360000000001s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5223.360000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5225.360000000001s)]
*  US engagement is critical and President Trump made that possible? [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5232.88s)]
*  That is clear. That is obvious. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5235.88s)]
*  It's really happening. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5237.88s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5239.88s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5243.88s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5246.88s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5248.88s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5250.88s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5252.88s)]
*  the initiative taken by the US some time ago. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5257.88s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5259.88s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5262.400000000001s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5265.400000000001s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5270.400000000001s)]
*  as we do much closer now, [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5273.400000000001s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5275.400000000001s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5279.400000000001s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5281.400000000001s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5283.400000000001s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5286.400000000001s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe and it's a bad thing for the world [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5288.92s)]
*  to have such a broad conflict going on. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5291.92s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5294.92s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5298.92s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5301.92s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5306.92s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5308.92s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5310.92s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5312.92s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5314.92s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5317.4400000000005s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5322.4400000000005s)]
*  If the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5327.4400000000005s)]
*  trying to broker peace, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5332.4400000000005s)]
*  does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5334.4400000000005s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5336.4400000000005s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5339.4400000000005s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5341.4400000000005s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that will be wonderful. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5343.4400000000005s)]
*  Sorry about your question. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5345.96s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks and we'll see. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5347.96s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5350.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5352.96s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5354.96s)]
*  You said once the President... [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5357.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5359.96s)]
*  to the White House after the liberation day. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5363.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5366.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5370.96s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5372.96s)]
*  I like the way your government runs. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5374.96s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5376.96s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5378.96s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5381.96s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5382.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5384.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5386.96s)]
*  Absolutely. You get me that invitation. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5389.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5392.96s)]
*  President Trump, the first point of concern is that [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5395.96s)]
*  you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5398.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5402.96s)]
*  in the way that we have structured our money and what are the... [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5406.96s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5410.96s)]
*  to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5414.96s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5418.96s)]
*  dedicate, innovate and move forward despite having these incomes [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5422.96s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5426.96s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5430.96s)]
*  half of them by the way here in the United States. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5433.96s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5436.96s)]
*  if we can share experiences and we do with our colleagues in the US. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5440.96s)]
*  You never copy this one-to-one, [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5444.96s)]
*  but there can be techniques and way of working [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5448.96s)]
*  that we have used in organizing our fund. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5451.96s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg was the Finance Minister [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5455.96s)]
*  when the first dollar entered that fund, [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5458.96s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5461.96s)]
*  What do you say, Jens? [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5464.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the US [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5466.96s)]
*  to also work with them if they want to establish a wealth fund [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5470.96s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5474.96s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5477.96s)]
*  is that half the fund, close to one trillion US dollars, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5481.96s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5485.96s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5489.96s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5493.96s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5497.96s)]
*  Then just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5501.96s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5504.96s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5507.96s)]
*  we commend the US for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5510.96s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5515.96s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5518.96s)]
*  the military support to Ukraine, and this year we will allocate [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5522.96s)]
*  close to eight billion US dollars to Ukraine, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5526.96s)]
*  that will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5530.96s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5533.96s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5536.96s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5540.96s)]
*  and we are investing in that. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5544.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5546.96s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5550.96s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5554.96s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5558.96s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5562.96s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5567.96s)]
*  It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5571.96s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5575.96s)]
*  Are the two nations in agreement of which country? [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5579.96s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5582.96s)]
*  called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5585.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5588.96s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5594.96s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5598.96s)]
*  All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5601.96s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5605.96s)]
*  because so many lives have been lost. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5609.96s)]
*  Not only soldiers, a lot of lives have been lost. [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5612.96s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5615.96s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5620.96s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5623.96s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? Number one, it didn't happen. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5626.96s)]
*  We never even discussed it. I would talk to Putin about it. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5629.96s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5632.96s)]
*  But we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5636.96s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5639.96s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5643.96s)]
*  And you know, when you mention what happened to Ukraine years ago [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5646.96s)]
*  under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5650.96s)]
*  unfortunately for this country, what happened is large chunks of lead were given up. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5655.96s)]
*  And it was called Crimea. And that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5661.96s)]
*  But this isn't my war. This is Biden's war. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5667.96s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5671.96s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire. And I think we'll be successful. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5676.96s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5680.96s)]
*  Otherwise, and the prime minister had a statement. He said, this is just a point in time. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5682.96s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5687.96s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5689.96s)]
*  Mr. President, would you have, would you have meetings with other world leaders here in Rome, sir? [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5693.96s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5697.96s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. And I feel pretty confident that we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5703.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5709.96s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5715.96s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5716.96s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5718.96s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5721.96s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5723.96s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5726.96s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5728.96s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5732.96s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5734.96s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5740.96s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5744.96s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5752.96s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5756.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Zabel Peace Prize if you match your creed? [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5759.96s)]
*  Do I deserve the no-move-leash? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5766.96s)]
*  If you match your creed. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5768.96s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5769.96s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5771.96s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5776.96s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5779.96s)]
*  You know we have four. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5781.96s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5782.96s)]
*  It's the same four. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5785.96s)]
*  But they're great countries, and they were brave doing it. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5787.96s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5790.96s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5791.96s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5793.96s)]
*  Mr. President. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5797.96s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5798.96s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5800.96s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5803.96s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5805.96s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5810.96s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5812.96s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5814.96s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a President who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5818.96s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5826.96s)]
*  Mr. President. [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5829.96s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second if we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5830.96s)]
*  And you're involved in it too because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5838.96s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5843.96s)]
*  And we're having very serious meetings. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5847.96s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5851.96s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5853.96s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5856.96s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5859.96s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5864.96s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5867.96s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5871.96s)]
*  And a lot of lives will be saved. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5873.96s)]
*  Mr. President. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5875.96s)]
*  On the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5877.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5886.96s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5888.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5891.96s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5895.96s)]
*  Extremely good numbers. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5897.96s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5899.96s)]
*  Because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5901.96s)]
*  I did. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5906.96s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5907.96s)]
*  It's way down. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5910.96s)]
*  Energy is down. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5912.96s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5913.96s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5915.96s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war too. [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5919.96s)]
*  I think that solving those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5922.96s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5929.96s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5931.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5936.96s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5938.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5944.96s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5945.96s)]
*  And they happened. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5946.96s)]
*  They went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5947.96s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5949.96s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5953.96s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5955.96s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5958.96s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5960.96s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5962.96s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5964.96s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5965.96s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5967.96s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5968.96s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5971.96s)]
*  We have a very strong country. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5974.96s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5975.96s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5977.96s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5981.96s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — it would be physically impossible. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5986.96s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5991.96s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=5996.96s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6002.96s)]
*  Some treat it as very unfairly. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6004.96s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6006.96s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6008.96s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6010.96s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6017.96s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6022.96s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6024.96s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6026.96s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military. [[01:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6029.96s)]
*  And then they don't get treated fairly on trade. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6034.96s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6036.96s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6039.96s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6043.96s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6047.96s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6052.96s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6056.96s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6060.96s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6064.96s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6068.96s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6069.96s)]
*  I blamed the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6071.96s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6076.96s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6078.96s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6080.96s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6084.96s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6086.96s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6090.96s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6092.96s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6095.96s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6098.96s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6102.96s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6104.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6106.96s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6820.96s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturus here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6822.96s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6828.96s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6832.96s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6840.96s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6842.96s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6844.96s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, dying — young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6848.96s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6858.96s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6862.96s)]
*  And I think we've made a lot of progress. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6864.96s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6866.96s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6868.96s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6870.96s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6872.96s)]
*  We'll do something. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6882.96s)]
*  I think the Prime Minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6884.96s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6890.96s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[01:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6895.96s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6898.96s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6900.96s)]
*  The weather is — thank you very much. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6903.96s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6906.96s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6907.96s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6913.96s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6915.96s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6917.96s)]
*  We are allies. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6920.96s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic, a lot of confidence between our services. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6921.96s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6927.96s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6931.96s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6940.96s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6944.96s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6946.96s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6953.96s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6959.96s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6961.96s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6963.96s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6967.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6971.96s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6972.96s)]
*  Any questions? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6973.96s)]
*  Yes. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6975.96s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6976.96s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6983.96s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6985.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6988.96s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6990.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6992.96s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6994.96s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=6998.96s)]
*  We didn't, but I love it. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7000.96s)]
*  I mean, I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7002.96s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7006.96s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[01:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7011.96s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7012.96s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7014.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7018.96s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7028.96s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7035.96s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7040.96s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7043.96s)]
*  It's the war. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7045.96s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7046.96s)]
*  And if we can do that, I've also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7047.96s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7055.96s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7056.96s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7059.96s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7066.96s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7068.96s)]
*  It's horrible. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7070.96s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7072.96s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7073.96s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7074.96s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7078.96s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7080.96s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7082.96s)]
*  Do you think that Russia, that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7085.96s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7095.96s)]
*  I do. [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7096.96s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7097.96s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7098.96s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7100.96s)]
*  Soon. [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7101.96s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7103.96s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7110.96s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7113.96s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7116.96s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7118.96s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[01:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7119.96s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7123.96s)]
*  Here, please, go ahead. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7125.96s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Social Post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7126.96s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[01:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7131.96s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7135.96s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7138.96s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7139.96s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7141.96s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[01:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7145.96s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7147.96s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's about. [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7148.96s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm quiet. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7151.96s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7152.96s)]
*  Sorry. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7154.96s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7155.96s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7159.96s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7162.96s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7164.96s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7166.96s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7168.96s)]
*  Things will happen. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7170.96s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7172.96s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7174.96s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7176.96s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7177.96s)]
*  They're dealing. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7179.96s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7180.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7182.96s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us what kind of pressure you're putting on Russia? [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7183.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7185.96s)]
*  And Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know. [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7187.96s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7190.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7192.96s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7195.96s)]
*  He's talking. [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7196.96s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7197.96s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7199.96s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7200.96s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7201.96s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7204.96s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7207.96s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7209.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7212.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7214.96s)]
*  You've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7215.96s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7226.96s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7228.96s)]
*  And he believes in the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7235.96s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7240.96s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Ukraine that? [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7242.96s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here. [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7245.96s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7248.96s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7250.96s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7255.96s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7257.96s)]
*  But he's been a great secretary general. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7258.96s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7260.96s)]
*  Very successful. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7262.96s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7263.96s)]
*  He's right here. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7266.96s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7267.96s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7273.96s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7275.96s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7276.96s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7278.96s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7280.96s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7283.96s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was ended over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7285.96s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7291.96s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7293.96s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7296.96s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7299.96s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7301.96s)]
*  There was no anything. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7302.96s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7303.96s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7304.96s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7306.96s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7310.96s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7315.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a new peace proposal that you put on the table. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7316.96s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[02:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7319.96s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7321.96s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal immediately. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7325.96s)]
*  Russia has not. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7330.96s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7331.96s)]
*  I don't think so. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7338.96s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7339.96s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7341.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7343.96s)]
*  Complicated. [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7344.96s)]
*  Very complicated. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7345.96s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7346.96s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7350.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7351.96s)]
*  This war is endable. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7358.96s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7359.96s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7361.96s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7362.96s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7363.96s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7364.96s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7366.96s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7367.96s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7368.96s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7373.96s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7374.96s)]
*  And the president wants to stop it. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7379.96s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7380.96s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7384.96s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, you know. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7386.96s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7388.96s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7390.96s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7392.96s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7394.96s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7397.96s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7399.96s)]
*  And we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7400.96s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, and we are nice people, but we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7402.96s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7409.96s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7419.96s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7421.96s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7424.96s)]
*  Mr. President, if you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7426.96s)]
*  To buy more? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7437.96s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7439.96s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7441.96s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7443.96s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[02:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7445.96s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7447.96s)]
*  We have — we've had a great relationship. [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7450.96s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7452.96s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7454.96s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7457.96s)]
*  You can't do better. [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7459.96s)]
*  Really? [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7460.96s)]
*  If they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7462.96s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7466.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7467.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you've had a long meeting with Norway today. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7468.96s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7471.96s)]
*  Totally. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7481.96s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7482.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7483.96s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7491.96s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7492.96s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7494.96s)]
*  That is clear. [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7505.96s)]
*  That is obvious. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7506.96s)]
*  It's really happening. [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7507.96s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7509.96s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7516.96s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7518.96s)]
*  Lives are being lost, and we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7521.96s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7530.96s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7532.96s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[02:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7535.96s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7540.96s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7549.96s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7551.96s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[02:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7553.96s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7556.96s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7558.96s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7564.96s)]
*  Mr. President, follow-up question on China. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7568.96s)]
*  Mr. President, if I forgot my question. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7571.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[02:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7577.96s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7580.96s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7581.96s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7583.96s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more hatred missiles. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7586.96s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7591.96s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on hatred missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7596.96s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[02:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7609.96s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7611.96s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7612.96s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7614.96s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7616.96s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7620.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7622.96s)]
*  You said once the President... [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7627.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the relation thing. [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7628.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7636.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7640.96s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7642.96s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7647.96s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7649.96s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7651.96s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7652.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7654.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7656.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7657.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7659.96s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7660.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7662.96s)]
*  President Trump, I just want to inform you that you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7665.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and whatever. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7673.96s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7681.96s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward despite having these incomes, [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7689.96s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest and we have transferred that into investments, [[02:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7697.96s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7703.96s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7706.96s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7710.96s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7715.96s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7726.96s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say, Jens? [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7731.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7735.96s)]
*  if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7741.96s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7746.96s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7753.96s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government bonds. [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7760.96s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7763.96s)]
*  And just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7771.96s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7777.96s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7783.96s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7788.96s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7794.96s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7800.96s)]
*  If I may add to that, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7803.96s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7807.96s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7811.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7816.96s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister. [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7824.96s)]
*  Do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7832.96s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7838.96s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7845.96s)]
*  Are there today's agreements of which countries? [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7849.96s)]
*  Mr. President, 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7852.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7859.96s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7865.96s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible, horrible. All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[02:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7869.96s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7875.96s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7883.96s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7886.96s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7893.96s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. I would talk to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye. [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7897.96s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7903.96s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7909.96s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7913.96s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, what happened is large chunks of lead were given up. [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7921.96s)]
*  And it was called Crimea. And that was a big, that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[02:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7931.96s)]
*  But this isn't my war. This is Biden's war. This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[02:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7937.96s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7946.96s)]
*  Otherwise, and the prime minister had a statement. He said, this is just a point in time. We're very lucky because this is a point. [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7952.96s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7959.96s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have, will you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome, sir? [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7963.96s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. I think he wants to end it. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7970.96s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. But we're going to, we're going to know pretty soon. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7975.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, do you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7979.96s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7985.96s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7986.96s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. I'd like to take care of all of them. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7989.96s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet and they want to meet about trade. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7993.96s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=7998.96s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8005.96s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8011.96s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8014.96s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. And we will see if they follow through on that. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8023.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you manage to create it? [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8030.96s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8037.96s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8039.96s)]
*  But they say for the Abraham Accords. And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8044.96s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. You know we have four. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8049.96s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one too. It's the same four. [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8053.96s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. And it's worked out very well. [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8057.96s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8061.96s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8068.96s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8070.96s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. Of all the leaders in the world today, [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8073.96s)]
*  no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8077.96s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8081.96s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[02:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8085.96s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8090.96s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. So it's hard work. [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8096.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8100.96s)]
*  And we could, Mr. Prime Minister. And you're involved in it too because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8108.96s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran and we're having very serious meetings. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8114.96s)]
*  And there are only two options. And one option is not a good option. It's not a good option at all. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8121.96s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8129.96s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. But that one is well in its way. [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8134.96s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[02:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8141.96s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8146.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8157.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8162.96s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8166.96s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, [[02:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8169.96s)]
*  Oh, I said I was going to get prices down. I did. Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8174.96s)]
*  It's way down. Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8181.96s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8185.96s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war too. Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8190.96s)]
*  Groceries are down. When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8200.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I've been here for I was here for about a week when the when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8207.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. Tell me about eggs. And they happened. They were they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8214.96s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs. [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8220.96s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. So we did a great job. Housing is doing very well. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8226.96s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. That's the Fed. I hope they lower interest rates. That's a smart thing to do. [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8233.96s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8238.96s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country, and we have every other country. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8242.96s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8247.96s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair because we don't have to go through all of these. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8251.96s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8258.96s)]
*  And we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8266.96s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. Some treated us very unfairly. They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8271.96s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8278.96s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. We've taken care of their militaries. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8288.96s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8294.96s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[02:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8299.96s)]
*  So the people and I don't blame those countries. I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[02:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8307.96s)]
*  And they let us lose four billion dollars a day on trade. We were losing four or five billion dollars a day on trade when I got here. [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8317.96s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. And we're going to be making four or five billion dollars a day on trade. [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8326.96s)]
*  So, but I don't blame any country. Not the worst of them. And we were abused by countries. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8334.96s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. Disgraceful. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8341.96s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8348.96s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8354.96s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. China paid not ten cents to any other president. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8361.96s)]
*  And they, but not only China, virtually every country got away with murder. And we just can't let that happen. [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8366.96s)]
*  Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8374.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8391.96s)]

*  Thank you. [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8901.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8931.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8961.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=8991.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9021.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9051.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. We have Jonas Garsturus here, who is the, as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9081.96s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9098.96s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. Doing very well, I think, on both. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9103.96s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. And every respect, the war is very important. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9112.96s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, dying, young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9118.96s)]
*  And we want to end that war. We want to end it quickly. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9128.96s)]
*  And I think we've made a lot of progress. And we'll see what happens. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9134.96s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9138.96s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9143.96s)]
*  We'll do something. But I think the Prime Minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9152.96s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[02:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9161.96s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you, the way it is. Thank you very much. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9168.96s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. This year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9176.96s)]
*  We come here early in your term. Appreciate that you take time. [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9183.96s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. We are allies. We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9187.96s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9194.96s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9202.96s)]
*  It's a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9211.96s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9217.96s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. We can be complementary and we can find good solutions. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9224.96s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9234.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9242.96s)]
*  Any questions? [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9245.96s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9247.96s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. I think we'll have no problem. [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9254.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9261.96s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? Did you too discuss a possible visit to President Trump? [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9265.96s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. I mean, I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9271.96s)]
*  I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. He's welcome to visit Norway. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9278.96s)]
*  We would like to have him and it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[02:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9283.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9289.96s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[02:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9299.96s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[02:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9305.96s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. It's the war. It's the soldiers. [[02:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9313.96s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9318.96s)]
*  It should have never happened and it would have never happened if I were president. [[02:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9326.96s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. And that's what got me involved. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9330.96s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. It's horrible. It's a killing field. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9339.96s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week on average. And we want to stop that. [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9344.96s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. But I would say that is my number one reason. [[02:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9350.96s)]
*  Do you think that Russia, that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9355.96s)]
*  I think so. I do. I believe they will accept. And I think we're going to get this over with. I hope so. Soon. [[02:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9365.96s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9372.96s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[02:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9380.96s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. I think we need that for international peace. [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9383.96s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9388.96s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[02:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9389.96s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9393.96s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words Vladimir, stop. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9396.96s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9402.96s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9406.96s)]
*  I didn't like last night. I wasn't happy with it. [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9409.96s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9412.96s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. That's what I meant. [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9416.96s)]
*  And that's what I said. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9419.96s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9422.96s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9424.96s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9430.96s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. I want to see if we can have a deal. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9433.96s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. Let me put it that way. [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9436.96s)]
*  Things will happen. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9440.96s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9442.96s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9445.96s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure? You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9447.96s)]
*  They're dealing. You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9449.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9452.96s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9454.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[02:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9455.96s)]
*  And Russia knows that. And some people that are close to it know. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9457.96s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9460.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9463.96s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. He's talking. [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9465.96s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. I think he wants to make a deal. [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9468.96s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. But it takes two to tango. [[02:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9470.96s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too. [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9474.96s)]
*  They're being hit very hard. And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9477.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9482.96s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. Do you stand by that? [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9495.96s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree. [[02:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9498.96s)]
*  And he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9506.96s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9510.96s)]
*  And do you stand by Ukraine and have to give Ukraine some of its resources? [[02:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9512.96s)]
*  Well, the former Secretary General happens to be right here. [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9515.96s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9519.96s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9521.96s)]
*  Because that's what you are. Really, you're a general. [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9526.96s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. We had a tremendous relationship. [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9529.96s)]
*  Very successful. And I think he could speak for himself. He's right here. [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9532.96s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9537.96s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. They've been fighting. They've lost a lot of territory. [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9543.96s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9548.96s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9553.96s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9555.96s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9561.96s)]
*  And they made a decision. There wasn't a bullet fire. There was no fighting. There was no anything. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9567.96s)]
*  They just handed it over. Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9573.96s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[02:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9577.96s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was President, not by Donald Trump. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9580.96s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9585.96s)]
*  Mr. President, I had a long meeting with Mr. President. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9586.96s)]
*  The U.S. peace proposal that you put on the table is a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9588.96s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9591.96s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[02:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9595.96s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, [[02:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9599.96s)]
*  just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9606.96s)]
*  I don't think so. I think that they both want peace right now. They're ready to do something. [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9608.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. Complicated. Very complicated. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9613.96s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. Marco, what would you say? [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9616.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9622.96s)]
*  This war is endable. Both sides just have to agree to it. [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9628.96s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. We've discussed those ideas. [[02:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9631.96s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9633.96s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. We need both of them to say yes. [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9636.96s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9639.96s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9643.96s)]
*  because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[02:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9649.96s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9652.96s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9656.96s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. We're trying to end the destruction. [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9659.96s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[02:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9663.96s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there, but they have to ultimately say yes. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9668.96s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[02:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9671.96s)]
*  If you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9674.96s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9678.96s)]
*  What concessions has the president and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9680.96s)]
*  Stopping the war. Stopping taking the whole country. Pretty big concession. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9690.96s)]
*  Mr. President, if you are going to take out the tariffs, do you want Norway to buy more from the US? [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9697.96s)]
*  To buy more? Well, you don't need snow. You don't need skis. You don't need ski champions either, right? [[02:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9707.96s)]
*  You have a lot of them. We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9716.96s)]
*  We've had a great relationship. I think now maybe closer than ever. [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9720.96s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. I think just keep it the way it is. You can't do better. [[02:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9725.96s)]
*  Really? Not even by, say, five minutes? [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9730.96s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. You can't do much better. Yes, yes. [[02:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9733.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9738.96s)]
*  But on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9744.96s)]
*  Totally. It's totally common ground. The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9751.96s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. He's going to help us end it. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9761.96s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9764.96s)]
*  That is clear. That is obvious. It's really happening. [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9776.96s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[02:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9779.96s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. They are defending themselves. Lives are being lost. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9787.96s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[02:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9793.96s)]
*  It needs to be respected. And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[02:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9800.96s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9806.96s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump for being open in that process. [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9810.96s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. And then we have to move on. [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9819.96s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9823.96s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9826.96s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9835.96s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9839.96s)]
*  Mr. President, if... I forgot my question. [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9842.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9848.96s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9851.96s)]
*  It happens. [[02:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9852.96s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9853.96s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more patriot missiles. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9857.96s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9862.96s)]
*  If you and the United States decide to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9866.96s)]
*  Let's see what happens. I think we're going to make a deal. [[02:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9879.96s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. We won't have to worry about your question. [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9882.96s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9886.96s)]
*  And we'll see. But I think we're getting very close. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9890.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[02:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9893.96s)]
*  You said once the President... [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9898.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the relation thing. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9899.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[02:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9907.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9911.96s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9913.96s)]
*  And I respect the King. He's highly respected in Norway. It's a great thing. Not an easy thing to do. [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9917.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9924.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[02:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9927.96s)]
*  Absolutely. You get me that invitation. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9930.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9933.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9936.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our funding and what our... [[02:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9943.96s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9951.96s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward, [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9959.96s)]
*  despite having these incomes, which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9965.96s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[02:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9970.96s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[02:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9976.96s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., you never copy this one-to-one, [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9980.96s)]
*  but there can be techniques and ways of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9988.96s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[02:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=9995.96s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say? [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10001.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[02:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10005.96s)]
*  if they want to establish a wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10011.96s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10017.96s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[02:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10023.96s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10030.96s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the Sovereign Wealth Fund. [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10034.96s)]
*  And just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10041.96s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10047.96s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10053.96s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[02:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10059.96s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine, [[02:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10065.96s)]
*  that will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10070.96s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10073.96s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10077.96s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10081.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveil your reciprocal tariffs [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10086.96s)]
*  on April the 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10093.96s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10098.96s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[02:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10103.96s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10108.96s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10116.96s)]
*  Are there today's negotiations in agreement of which countries? [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10120.96s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10123.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10130.96s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10136.96s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible, horrible. All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10140.96s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10146.96s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[02:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10153.96s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10157.96s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10164.96s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. I would talk to Putin about it. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10168.96s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[02:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10172.96s)]
*  But we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10176.96s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[02:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10180.96s)]
*  And it was only when I get out and, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[02:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10184.96s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, what happened is large chunks of lead [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10192.96s)]
*  were given up and it was called Crimea. And that was a big that was a big thing. [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10201.96s)]
*  That was a big moment. But this is in my war. This is Biden's war. [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10206.96s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[02:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10211.96s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[02:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10217.96s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[02:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10220.96s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. He said, this is just a point in time. [[02:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10223.96s)]
*  We're very lucky because there's a point. And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10228.96s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have you have meetings with other world leaders? [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10233.96s)]
*  You're in Rome, sir. [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10236.96s)]
*  Future Democrat president? [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10238.96s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10240.96s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. And I feel pretty confident that we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10244.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[02:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10250.96s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10256.96s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[02:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10257.96s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10259.96s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10262.96s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[02:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10267.96s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10273.96s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[02:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10275.96s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10281.96s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10285.96s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. [[02:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10293.96s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10297.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Zabel Peace Prize if you match your creative? [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10300.96s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10307.96s)]
*  If you match your creative. [[02:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10309.96s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one. [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10310.96s)]
*  But they say for the Abraham Accords. And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10314.96s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. You know we have four. [[02:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10320.96s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. It's the same four. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10324.96s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. And it's worked out very well. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10328.96s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10332.96s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10338.96s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[02:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10340.96s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. Of all the leaders in the world today, [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10344.96s)]
*  no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[02:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10347.96s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10352.96s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10356.96s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace [[02:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10360.96s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. So it's hard work. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10366.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second. [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10371.96s)]
*  And we could, Mr. Prime Minister. And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[02:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10378.96s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. And we're having very serious meetings. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10384.96s)]
*  And there are only two options. And one option is not a good option. It's not a good option at all. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10392.96s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10400.96s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. We could have a very, very good decision. And a lot of lives will be saved. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10408.96s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[02:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10417.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[02:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10427.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10432.96s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10436.96s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[02:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10440.96s)]
*  I did. Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. It's way down. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10447.96s)]
*  Energy is down. And we're about $64 a barrel. When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[02:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10453.96s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree [[02:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10461.96s)]
*  with solving the war problem. Groceries are down. When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10469.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I've been here for I was here for about a week when the when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10478.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. Tell me about eggs. And they happened. They were they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[02:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10485.96s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[02:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10490.96s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. So we did a great job. Housing is doing very well. [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10496.96s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. That's the Fed. I hope they lower interest rates. That's a smart thing to do. [[02:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10503.96s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country. [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10509.96s)]
*  And we have every other country. I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[02:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10516.96s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair because we don't have to go through all of these. [[02:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10522.96s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[02:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10529.96s)]
*  And we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. Some will be tariffed. [[02:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10537.96s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. They'll be tariffed higher than others. But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[02:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10545.96s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10551.96s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. We've taken care of their militaries and militaries. [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10559.96s)]
*  That is another subject we talk about. We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10566.96s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[02:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10570.96s)]
*  So the people and I don't blame those countries. I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[02:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10578.96s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10588.96s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10596.96s)]
*  So, but I don't blame any country. Not the worst of them. And we were abused by countries. [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10604.96s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. Disgraceful. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10612.96s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[02:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10618.96s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10624.96s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10631.96s)]
*  And they, but not only China, virtually every country got away with murder. And we just can't let that happen. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10636.96s)]
*  Thank you very much everybody. Thank you very much. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=10644.96s)]

*  Thank you. [[03:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11236.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11266.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11296.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11326.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11356.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11386.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11416.96s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. This year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11447.96s)]
*  We come here early in your term. Appreciate that you take time. [[03:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11454.96s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. We are allies. We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11458.96s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11465.96s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11472.96s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11481.96s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11487.96s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. We can be complementary. And we can find good solutions. [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11493.96s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11503.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11511.96s)]
*  Any questions? [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11514.96s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11517.96s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. I think we'll have no problem. [[03:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11524.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[03:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11531.96s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? Did you too discuss a possible visit for President Trump to Norway? [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11535.96s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. I mean, I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11541.96s)]
*  I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. He's welcome to visit Norway. [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11548.96s)]
*  We would like to have him and it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11553.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11559.96s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[03:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11569.96s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[03:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11576.96s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. It's the war. It's the soldiers and we can do that. [[03:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11584.96s)]
*  Also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11590.96s)]
*  It should have never happened and it would have never happened if I were president. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11596.96s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. And that's what got me involved. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11601.96s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. It's horrible. It's a killing field. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11609.96s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week on average. And we want to stop that. We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[03:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11615.96s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11623.96s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11626.96s)]
*  I think so, yeah. I do. I believe they will accept. And I think we're going to get this over with. I hope so. Soon. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11636.96s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11643.96s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11651.96s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. I think we need that for international peace. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11654.96s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[03:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11659.96s)]
*  If you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11660.96s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11663.96s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11666.96s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words Vladimir, stop. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11667.96s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11672.96s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[03:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11676.96s)]
*  I didn't like last night. I wasn't happy with it. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11679.96s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[03:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11682.96s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. That's what I meant. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11686.96s)]
*  And that's what it's about. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11689.96s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11692.96s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11695.96s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11700.96s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. I want to see if we can have a deal. [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11703.96s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. Let me put it that way. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11706.96s)]
*  Things will happen. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11710.96s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11712.96s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans... [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11715.96s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11716.96s)]
*  They're dealing. You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11719.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11722.96s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11724.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11725.96s)]
*  And Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know. [[03:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11727.96s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11730.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11732.96s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. He's talking. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11735.96s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. I think he wants to make a deal. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11738.96s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[03:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11741.96s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[03:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11743.96s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11745.96s)]
*  They're being hit very hard. [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11748.96s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11750.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, is the Prime Minister fine with it? [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11753.96s)]
*  You've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11758.96s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11767.96s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree. [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11769.96s)]
*  And he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11776.96s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11781.96s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Ukraine some territory? [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11783.96s)]
*  The former Secretary General happens to be right here. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11786.96s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11789.96s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11791.96s)]
*  Because that's what you are. Really, you're a general. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11796.96s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11799.96s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. Very successful. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11801.96s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. He's right here. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11804.96s)]
*  But do you still disagree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11808.96s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11814.96s)]
*  They've been fighting. They've lost a lot of territory. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11816.96s)]
*  And we'll do the best we can. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11818.96s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[03:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11821.96s)]
*  They lost a lot of territory. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11824.96s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11826.96s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[03:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11832.96s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11834.96s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11838.96s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. There was no fighting. There was no anything. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11841.96s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11844.96s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11845.96s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11848.96s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was President, not by Donald Trump. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11851.96s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11856.96s)]
*  Mr. President, we've had a long meeting. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11857.96s)]
*  The U.S. peace proposal that you put on the table, it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11858.96s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11862.96s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11866.96s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11870.96s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11872.96s)]
*  I don't think so. I think that they both want peace right now. [[03:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11879.96s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11882.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11884.96s)]
*  Complicated. Very complicated. [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11885.96s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11887.96s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11891.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11892.96s)]
*  This war is endable. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11899.96s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11900.96s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11902.96s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[03:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11903.96s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11904.96s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11905.96s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[03:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11907.96s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11908.96s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11909.96s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11914.96s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11915.96s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11922.96s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11926.96s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, you know, but we're trying to end the dying. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11927.96s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11932.96s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11933.96s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11936.96s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11938.96s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[03:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11940.96s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11941.96s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[03:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11944.96s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11948.96s)]
*  What concessions has the president and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[03:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11950.96s)]
*  Stopping the war, stopping taking the whole country. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11961.96s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[03:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11965.96s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more from the U.S.? [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11967.96s)]
*  Buy more? [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11978.96s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11980.96s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11982.96s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11984.96s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11986.96s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[03:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11988.96s)]
*  We have, we've had a great relationship. [[03:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11990.96s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11992.96s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[03:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=11998.96s)]
*  You can't do better. [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12000.96s)]
*  Really? [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12002.96s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[03:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12004.96s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12006.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12008.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12010.96s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12012.96s)]
*  But on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12014.96s)]
*  Totally. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12022.96s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[03:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12024.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12026.96s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12032.96s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12034.96s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[03:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12036.96s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical and President Trump made that possible? [[03:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12042.96s)]
*  That is clear. [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12046.96s)]
*  That is obvious. [[03:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12048.96s)]
*  It's really happening. [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12050.96s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12052.96s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[03:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12056.96s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12058.96s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12060.96s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12062.96s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12068.96s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12070.96s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12074.96s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12078.96s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12082.96s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12086.96s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12088.96s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12090.96s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12094.96s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12096.96s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12102.96s)]
*  Mr. President, follow-up question on China. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12106.96s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12110.96s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[03:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12112.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12114.96s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[03:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12116.96s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[03:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12118.96s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the situation in the United States. [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12120.96s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12124.96s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12128.96s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12132.96s)]
*  If the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, [[03:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12136.96s)]
*  does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12144.96s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12150.96s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[03:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12152.96s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12154.96s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12156.96s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks and we'll see. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12158.96s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12162.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12164.96s)]
*  What does the President... [[03:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12168.96s)]
*  If the President... [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12170.96s)]
*  Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the relation day. [[03:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12172.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12178.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12181.96s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister and I like the way your government runs. [[03:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12183.96s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12187.96s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[03:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12189.96s)]
*  It's a great thing. Not an easy thing to do. [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12192.96s)]
*  Would you like... [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12194.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12196.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12198.96s)]
*  Absolutely. You get me that invitation. [[03:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12200.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit Norway. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12203.96s)]
*  President Trump, first one to come on the slide. [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12206.96s)]
*  You said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[03:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12209.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and... [[03:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12214.96s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[03:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12221.96s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicated, innovate and move forward. [[03:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12230.96s)]
*  Despite having these incomes, which we happen to be in a period of history where we can harvest. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12235.96s)]
*  And we have transferred that into investments. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12241.96s)]
*  Half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12244.96s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12246.96s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S. [[03:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12250.96s)]
*  You never copy this one-to-one. [[03:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12255.96s)]
*  But there can be techniques and ways of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12258.96s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12265.96s)]
*  So he's a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say? [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12271.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12275.96s)]
*  to also work with them if they want to establish a wealth fund. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12280.96s)]
*  Because we have a good experience with our fund. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12284.96s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[03:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12287.96s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12293.96s)]
*  Mainly in equity, but also some in fixed income, including government bonds. [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12299.96s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the wealth fund. [[03:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12304.96s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[03:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12312.96s)]
*  the path forward to peace. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12318.96s)]
*  And as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12320.96s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[03:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12326.96s)]
*  And therefore, I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12330.96s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[03:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12335.96s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12341.96s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12344.96s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12347.96s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves. [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12351.96s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[03:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12355.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12357.96s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12361.96s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12369.96s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12373.96s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12379.96s)]
*  It's a big fund. And they don't have any debt. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12383.96s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12387.96s)]
*  Are the two nations in agreement on which countries? [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12390.96s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12393.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12400.96s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[03:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12406.96s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. All wars are horrible. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12410.96s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12414.96s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12417.96s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12424.96s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[03:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12428.96s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. Zero chance it was going to. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12432.96s)]
*  And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12436.96s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12438.96s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12441.96s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12444.96s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12451.96s)]
*  And it was only when I get out. [[03:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12455.96s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, [[03:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12457.96s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12468.96s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12475.96s)]
*  But this is in my war. This is Biden's war. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12478.96s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12482.96s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[03:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12487.96s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12491.96s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. He said, This is just a point in time. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12494.96s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12498.96s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12500.96s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have you have meetings with other world leaders here in Rome? [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12504.96s)]
*  Future Democrat president? [[03:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12508.96s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12511.96s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. And I feel pretty confident of that. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12515.96s)]
*  But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12518.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12521.96s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12526.96s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12527.96s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12530.96s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12533.96s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12537.96s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12543.96s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12546.96s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12551.96s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12555.96s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. [[03:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12563.96s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[03:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12568.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Zimbabwean Peace Prize? [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12571.96s)]
*  Do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12577.96s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12580.96s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12582.96s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[03:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12587.96s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[03:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12590.96s)]
*  You know, we have four and Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12592.96s)]
*  It's the same four, but they're great countries and they were brave doing it. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12597.96s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12601.96s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[03:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12603.96s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[03:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12605.96s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12609.96s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12611.96s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12614.96s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12616.96s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12622.96s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12624.96s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12626.96s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12630.96s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[03:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12638.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second. [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12641.96s)]
*  And we could, Mr. Prime Minister, and you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12648.96s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12654.96s)]
*  And we're having very serious meetings. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12658.96s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12661.96s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12664.96s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12667.96s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12670.96s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12675.96s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12679.96s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12682.96s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12687.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[03:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12698.96s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12700.96s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[03:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12703.96s)]
*  I think we had very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12707.96s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12710.96s)]
*  I did. [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12717.96s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12718.96s)]
*  It's way down. [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12722.96s)]
*  Energy is down. [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12723.96s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[03:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12724.96s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12727.96s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12731.96s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12733.96s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12740.96s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[03:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12742.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12748.96s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[03:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12749.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12755.96s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[03:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12756.96s)]
*  And they happened. [[03:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12757.96s)]
*  They went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12758.96s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12761.96s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12765.96s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12767.96s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12770.96s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[03:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12772.96s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12774.96s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12776.96s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12777.96s)]
*  That's a smart thing to do. [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12778.96s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12780.96s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12783.96s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12787.96s)]
*  We can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[03:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12789.96s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12793.96s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — it would be physically impossible. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12798.96s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12803.96s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12808.96s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12814.96s)]
*  Some treat it as very unfairly. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12816.96s)]
*  We tariffed higher than others. [[03:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12818.96s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12820.96s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12822.96s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[03:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12829.96s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[03:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12834.96s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12836.96s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12838.96s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12840.96s)]
*  And then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12846.96s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12848.96s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12851.96s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12855.96s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12859.96s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12864.96s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12868.96s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12872.96s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12875.96s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12879.96s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12880.96s)]
*  I blamed the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12882.96s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12888.96s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12889.96s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[03:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12891.96s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12895.96s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12897.96s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12902.96s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12903.96s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[03:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12906.96s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12909.96s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[03:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12913.96s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[03:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12915.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=12918.96s)]

*  Thank you. [[03:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13593.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13623.96s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturus here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[03:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13633.919999999998s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[03:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13639.96s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13645.679999999998s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13652.96s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[03:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13653.96s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13656.96s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, dying — young people, mostly soldiers [[03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13659.96s)]
*  — from Russia and Ukraine. [[03:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13667.96s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[03:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13670.96s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[03:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13673.96s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13675.96s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13678.96s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[03:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13679.96s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13682.96s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13684.96s)]
*  on trade. [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13692.96s)]
*  We'll do something. [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13693.96s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13694.96s)]
*  very good to a lot of people. [[03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13699.96s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[03:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13701.96s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13707.96s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13709.96s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you the way this is. [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13712.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13716.96s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[03:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13717.96s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13719.96s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[03:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13724.96s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13726.96s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[03:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13728.96s)]
*  We are allies. [[03:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13731.96s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic, a lot of confidence between our services. [[03:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13732.96s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13738.96s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13743.96s)]
*  be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[03:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13749.96s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13752.96s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13756.96s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13758.96s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13764.96s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13770.96s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[03:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13772.96s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[03:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13775.96s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[03:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13779.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13783.96s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[03:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13784.96s)]
*  Any questions, please? [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13785.96s)]
*  Yes. [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13787.96s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[03:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13788.96s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[03:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13795.96s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[03:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13796.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13800.96s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13802.96s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13804.96s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13806.96s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to President Trump's home? [[03:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13810.96s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[03:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13812.96s)]
*  I love it. [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13813.96s)]
*  I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13814.96s)]
*  But I told the President that he is receiving us early in the term. [[03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13818.96s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13822.96s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13824.96s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[03:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13825.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13829.96s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13839.96s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13846.96s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives. [[03:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13851.96s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war. [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13854.96s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[03:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13858.96s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[03:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13859.96s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[03:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13867.96s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13868.96s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[03:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13871.96s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[03:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13878.96s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. [[03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13880.96s)]
*  It's horrible. [[03:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13882.96s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13884.96s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13885.96s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13890.96s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[03:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13891.96s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13894.96s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[03:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13897.96s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13907.96s)]
*  I do. [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13908.96s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13909.96s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13910.96s)]
*  I hope so. [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13912.96s)]
*  Soon. [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13913.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13914.96s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[03:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13921.96s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[03:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13924.96s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13927.96s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[03:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13929.96s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[03:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13930.96s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13934.96s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13936.96s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13937.96s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[03:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13943.96s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13947.96s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13950.96s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[03:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13951.96s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[03:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13953.96s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13957.96s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[03:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13959.96s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's like. [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13960.96s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm quiet. [[03:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13963.96s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13964.96s)]
*  Sorry. [[03:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13965.96s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13966.96s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[03:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13971.96s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[03:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13974.96s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[03:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13975.96s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[03:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13977.96s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[03:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13980.96s)]
*  Things will happen. [[03:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13981.96s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13983.96s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[03:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13986.96s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[03:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13988.96s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[03:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13989.96s)]
*  They're dealing. [[03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13990.96s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[03:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13991.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13993.96s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13994.96s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[03:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13996.96s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[03:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=13998.96s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know. [[03:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14000.96s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[03:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14002.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14004.96s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[03:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14006.96s)]
*  He's talking. [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14008.96s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14009.96s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14010.96s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[03:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14011.96s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14013.96s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[03:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14015.96s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14018.96s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[03:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14020.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14023.96s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. [[03:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14036.96s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[03:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14038.96s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree [[03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14039.96s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[03:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14047.96s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[03:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14051.96s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Ukraine that? [[03:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14053.96s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[03:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14056.96s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[03:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14060.96s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14062.96s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[03:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14067.96s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14068.96s)]
*  But he's been a great secretary general. [[03:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14069.96s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[03:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14071.96s)]
*  Very successful. [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14073.96s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[03:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14074.96s)]
*  He's right here. [[03:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14077.96s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14078.96s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[03:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14084.96s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[03:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14086.96s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[03:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14087.96s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[03:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14089.96s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14091.96s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[03:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14094.96s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[03:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14096.96s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14102.96s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14105.96s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[03:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14108.96s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[03:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14111.96s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[03:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14112.96s)]
*  There was no anything. [[03:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14113.96s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[03:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14114.96s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[03:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14115.96s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[03:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14118.96s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[03:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14121.96s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[03:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14126.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a peace proposal that you put on the table. [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14127.96s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[03:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14130.96s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[03:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14132.96s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[03:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14136.96s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[03:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14140.96s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that? [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14142.96s)]
*  Just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[03:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14147.96s)]
*  I don't think so. [[03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14149.96s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[03:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14150.96s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[03:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14152.96s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[03:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14154.96s)]
*  Complicated. [[03:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14155.96s)]
*  Very complicated. [[03:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14156.96s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[03:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14157.96s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[03:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14161.96s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[03:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14163.96s)]
*  This war is endable. [[03:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14169.96s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[03:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14170.96s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[03:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14172.96s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14173.96s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14174.96s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[03:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14175.96s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14176.96s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[03:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14178.96s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14179.96s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14184.96s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[03:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14185.96s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[03:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14192.96s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[03:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14196.96s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[03:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14198.96s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14200.96s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[03:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14202.96s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14204.96s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14206.96s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14209.96s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[03:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14211.96s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[03:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14212.96s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[03:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14214.96s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14218.96s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14220.96s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14231.96s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[03:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14233.96s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[03:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14236.96s)]
*  Mr. President. [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14238.96s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[03:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14240.96s)]
*  To buy more? [[03:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14248.96s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[03:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14250.96s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[03:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14252.96s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14254.96s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[03:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14256.96s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[03:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14258.96s)]
*  We have had a great relationship. [[03:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14261.96s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[03:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14264.96s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14266.96s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14268.96s)]
*  You can't do better. [[03:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14270.96s)]
*  Really? [[03:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14272.96s)]
*  If they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[03:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14274.96s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[03:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14277.96s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[03:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14279.96s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[03:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14280.96s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[03:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14282.96s)]
*  But on the Ukraine. [[03:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14285.96s)]
*  If I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[03:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14286.96s)]
*  Totally. [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14292.96s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[03:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14293.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14295.96s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14302.96s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[03:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14304.96s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical. [[03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14306.96s)]
*  And President Trump made that possible. [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14315.96s)]
*  That is clear. [[03:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14317.96s)]
*  That is obvious. [[03:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14318.96s)]
*  It's really happening. [[03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14319.96s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[03:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14321.96s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14328.96s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[03:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14330.96s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14332.96s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[03:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14335.96s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[03:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14341.96s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14343.96s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[03:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14347.96s)]
*  And here, I believe, Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump of being, you know, opening that process. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14351.96s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14360.96s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[03:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14362.96s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[03:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14364.96s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14367.96s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14369.96s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[03:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14375.96s)]
*  Mr. President, follow-up question on China. [[03:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14379.96s)]
*  Sir, Mr. President, if... [[03:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14382.96s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[03:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14385.96s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[03:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14388.96s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[03:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14391.96s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[03:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14393.96s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[03:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14394.96s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14398.96s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[04:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14403.96s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[04:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14407.96s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[04:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14420.96s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[04:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14422.96s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[04:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14424.96s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14426.96s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[04:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14428.96s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14432.96s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[04:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14434.96s)]
*  What does the President... [[04:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14439.96s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after Liberation Day. [[04:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14440.96s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14448.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[04:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14452.96s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14454.96s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14458.96s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[04:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14461.96s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[04:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14463.96s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[04:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14464.96s)]
*  Would you like... [[04:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14466.96s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[04:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14467.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[04:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14468.96s)]
*  Absolutely. [[04:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14471.96s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14472.96s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[04:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14474.96s)]
*  Mr. President, first of all, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[04:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14477.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our funding and whatever it is. [[04:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14484.96s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[04:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14492.96s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward, [[04:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14500.96s)]
*  despite having these incomes, which we happen to be in a period of history where we can harvest. [[04:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14506.96s)]
*  And we have transferred that into investments, half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14511.96s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[04:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14517.96s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., you never copy this one-to-one, [[04:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14521.96s)]
*  but there can be techniques and ways of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14529.96s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund. [[04:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14536.96s)]
*  So he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say? [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14542.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14546.96s)]
*  if they want to establish a sub-revalve fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[04:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14552.96s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[04:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14558.96s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14564.96s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[04:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14571.96s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the sub-revalve fund. [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14575.96s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14582.96s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[04:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14588.96s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[04:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14594.96s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14600.96s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14605.96s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[04:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14611.96s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14614.96s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[04:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14618.96s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14622.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister. [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14627.96s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14628.96s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[04:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14636.96s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[04:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14643.96s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. It's a big fund. And they don't have any debt. [[04:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14649.96s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[04:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14657.96s)]
*  Are there today's issues in agreement of which countries? [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14661.96s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[04:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14664.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions with Crimea? [[04:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14670.96s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14677.96s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[04:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14681.96s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14687.96s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[04:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14694.96s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[04:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14698.96s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to. And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[04:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14705.96s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. I would talk to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye. [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14709.96s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14714.96s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. And it was only when I got out. [[04:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14720.96s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14727.96s)]
*  what happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14738.96s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. That was a big moment. But this is in my war. This is Biden's war. [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14745.96s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14752.96s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[04:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14758.96s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. He said, This is just a point in time. We're very lucky because it's a point. [[04:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14764.96s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[04:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14771.96s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have a meeting with other world leaders in here and grow as a future Democrat president? [[04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14774.96s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. I think he wants to end it. [[04:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14780.96s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[04:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14786.96s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have a meeting with other world leaders? Yes, I will. [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14791.96s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[04:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14798.96s)]
*  That would be nice. I'd like to take care of all of them. But we have many of them there and they all want to meet and they want to meet about trade. [[04:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14803.96s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads in great deals. You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[04:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14810.96s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[04:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14816.96s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought and we will be talking technical terms as early [[04:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14823.38s)]
*  as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[04:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14830.0s)]
*  So South Koreans came early, they came with their A game and we will see if they follow [[04:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14835.3s)]
*  through on that. [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14841.179999999998s)]
*  Do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you manage to create it? [[04:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14842.18s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[04:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14849.5s)]
*  Well maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[04:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14852.1s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14854.26s)]
*  and by the way speaking of that we're going to be filling it up. [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14859.08s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14861.84s)]
*  You know we have four and Biden did nothing on that one too. [[04:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14864.42s)]
*  It's the same four, but they're great countries and they were brave doing it and it's worked [[04:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14868.94s)]
*  out very well and we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14873.300000000001s)]
*  They're going to be I think filling it up very rapidly. [[04:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14876.62s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14881.74s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords, but I would just point [[04:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14883.140000000001s)]
*  to one thing. [[04:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14886.900000000001s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or [[04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14887.900000000001s)]
*  end them than President Trump is right now. [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14891.86s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14894.94s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[04:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14895.94s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist [[04:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14898.46s)]
*  already and again I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president [[04:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14901.74s)]
*  who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[04:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14907.099999999999s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[04:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14910.699999999999s)]
*  You know Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second [[04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14913.259999999998s)]
*  if we could Mr. Prime Minister and you're involved in it too because you've been involved [[04:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14920.38s)]
*  in the world and peace. [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14924.699999999999s)]
*  I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran and we're having very serious meetings [[04:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14927.0s)]
*  and there are only two options and the one option is not a good option. [[04:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14934.64s)]
*  It's not a good option at all and I think we're doing very well on an agreement with [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14939.08s)]
*  Iran but that one we're doing a lot of things I will say but that one is well in its way. [[04:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14946.64s)]
*  We could have a very very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[04:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14954.08s)]
*  Mr. President on the economy there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of [[04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14958.84s)]
*  March the slowest pace since 2009. [[04:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14966.56s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator and perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this [[04:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14969.76s)]
*  as well. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14973.68s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader US economy? [[04:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14974.68s)]
*  No they have very good numbers on housing today extremely good numbers and that's despite [[04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14978.36s)]
*  interest rates because you know if you look at what happened everyone said oh I said I [[04:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14982.880000000001s)]
*  was going to get prices down I did. [[04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14987.880000000001s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states it's way down. [[04:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14990.16s)]
*  Energy is down and we're about $64 a barrel. [[04:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14995.24s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89.90 $95 and by the way that helps us solve the [[04:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=14998.84s)]
*  war too having those energy prices is a big a big incentive for Russia to also agree with [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15004.16s)]
*  solving the war problem. [[04:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15011.04s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15013.52s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago you were you were complaining about eggs. [[04:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15014.880000000001s)]
*  I said I just got here. [[04:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15020.04s)]
*  I've been here for I was here for about a week when the when the press started saying [[04:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15021.28s)]
*  about eggs have gone through the roof I said I just got here tell me about eggs and they [[04:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15025.52s)]
*  happened they were they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[04:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15029.6s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House thousands and thousands of eggs [[04:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15032.880000000001s)]
*  and the price was down 87 percent. [[04:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15039.28s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[04:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15041.92s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[04:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15044.160000000002s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[04:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15046.0s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[04:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15047.560000000001s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[04:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15048.560000000001s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do be ahead a little bit although already it's a little bit late. [[04:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15050.160000000002s)]
*  But in the end we just have a great country a very strong country and we have every other [[04:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15054.640000000001s)]
*  country I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal and they [[04:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15059.92s)]
*  either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair because we don't have [[04:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15065.68s)]
*  to go through all of these. [[04:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15069.84s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. [[04:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15072.0s)]
*  You know you have so many people that really understand it which is a very small group [[04:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15073.44s)]
*  of people here and we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. [[04:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15078.08s)]
*  Some will be tariffed some treated as very unfairly. [[04:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15085.52s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others but we've been ripped off for many many years. [[04:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15088.960000000001s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the [[04:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15093.52s)]
*  world has been ripped off for 45 50 years and countries have gone rich by doing that [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15097.12s)]
*  with the United States. [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15104.48s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries and military is another subject we talk about. [[04:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15105.52s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals but you know you know the same [[04:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15109.36s)]
*  countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military and then don't get [[04:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15114.16s)]
*  treated fairly on trade. [[04:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15118.24s)]
*  So the people and I don't blame those countries. [[04:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15119.6s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you because those people [[04:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15122.48s)]
*  didn't do the job for this country and they let us lose four billion dollars a day on [[04:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15128.08s)]
*  trade. [[04:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15134.88s)]
*  We were losing four or five billion dollars a day on trade when I got here and now we're [[04:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15135.38s)]

*  billion dollars a day on trade. [[04:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15144.8s)]
*  So but the I don't blame any country. [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15146.96s)]
*  Not not the worst of them. [[04:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15150.56s)]
*  We were abused by countries. [[04:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15151.92s)]
*  I blamed the president of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals [[04:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15153.92s)]
*  were made. [[04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15158.72s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[04:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15159.52s)]
*  When I was here we had a great four years. [[04:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15160.72s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term and we [[04:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15162.64s)]
*  were very tough on trade and with China as you know they paid hundreds of billions of [[04:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15167.52s)]
*  dollars in tariffs but nobody else ever did that. [[04:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15171.92s)]
*  China paid not ten cents to any other president and they but not only China virtually [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15175.04s)]
*  every country got away with murder and we just can't let that happen. [[04:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=15182.0s)]

*  but it needs political will and push and we have exchanged ideas on that and then I think the [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16024.720000000001s)]
*  president and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. We have also emphasized [[04:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16030.16s)]

*  well uh this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from [[04:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16764.079999999998s)]

*  is a model which we have been able to explore if we can share experiences and we do with our [[04:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16789.92s)]
*  colleagues in the u.s you never copy this one-to-one but there can be [[04:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16795.600000000002s)]
*  techniques and way of working that we have used in organizing our fund [[04:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16802.56s)]

*  certain wealth fund because we have a good experience with our phone and i think that one [[04:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16826.0s)]
*  example of how we work together with united states is that half the phone close to one trillion us [[04:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16831.76s)]
*  dollars are invested in the united states mainly mainly equity but also some fixed income including [[04:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16837.68s)]
*  so this is an expression of trust in the united states expressed by the strong investment of the [[04:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16846.239999999998s)]

*  discussion about ukraine the path forward to peace and as the prime minister said we commend [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16858.96s)]
*  us for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution at the same time we need to continue to [[04:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16864.399999999998s)]
*  support ukraine and therefore i'm proud that norway has actually tripled the military support [[04:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16870.48s)]
*  to ukraine and this year we will allocate close to eight billion u.s dollars to ukraine that will [[04:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16876.56s)]
*  strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table i may add to that you know if [[04:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16883.6s)]
*  there is a piece and there will be a piece we have a common responsibility in securing democratic [[04:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16887.52s)]
*  ukraine for the future and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend [[04:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16892.72s)]
*  themselves and we are investing in that mr prime minister as it relates to tariffs mr president [[04:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16897.44s)]
*  when you unveil your reciprocal tariffs on april the second the tariff rate for norway was 15 [[04:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16903.6s)]
*  percent based upon your conversations that you've had today with the prime minister do you see that [[04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16910.48s)]
*  tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago well they have a great fund [[04:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16916.48s)]
*  of two trillion dollars it's a big fund and they don't have any debt so i think they'd probably be [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16923.76s)]
*  willing to pay us more than that i hope are you in agreement yes 2018 your former secretary of [[04:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16930.399999999998s)]

*  would have never started if i were president this is a war that is a horrible horrible that all [[04:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16950.16s)]
*  wars are horrible this one is in particular bad and i don't know that you can ever say there's [[04:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16955.6s)]
*  going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost not only soldiers a lot of [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16962.0s)]
*  lives have been lost i think that we want to do one very simple thing it would have never happened [[04:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16967.6s)]
*  if i were president zero chance it was going to and it didn't you know people say how do you know [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16976.24s)]
*  that number one it didn't happen we never even discussed it i would talk to putin about it was [[04:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16980.64s)]
*  the apple of his eye you know uh ukraine was the apple of putin's eye but we never there was never [[04:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16985.12s)]
*  even a thought that he'd go in and i think he understood that i would not be happy if he did [[04:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16991.2s)]
*  and it was only when i got out and you know when you mentioned what happened to ukraine years ago [[04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=16996.88s)]
*  president obama and a vice president that was also president later unfortunately for this country [[04:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17003.36s)]
*  what happened is uh large chunks of lead were given up and it was called primia and that was [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17010.32s)]
*  a big that was a big thing that was a big moment but uh this is in my war this is biden's war this [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17017.760000000002s)]

*  and i think we'll be successful and if we do we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise and [[04:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17031.68s)]
*  the prime minister had a statement he said uh this is just a point in time we're very lucky [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17036.56s)]
*  because this is a point and if this doesn't happen this could go on for a long time [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17041.52s)]
*  i don't think he will i think he wants to make peace i think he wants to end it and i feel pretty [[04:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17053.6s)]
*  confident of that but we're gonna we're gonna know pretty soon [[04:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17059.68s)]
*  yes i will which leaders do you want to meet sir well i'd like to meet them all that would be nice [[04:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17068.64s)]

*  and they want to meet about trade and we are making some great inroads and great deals you [[04:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17079.6s)]
*  might want to speak about that mr secretary we had a very successful bilateral meeting with [[04:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17085.84s)]
*  republic of south korea today we may be moving faster than i thought and we will be talking [[04:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17090.8s)]
*  technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17098.88s)]
*  so south koreans came early they came with their a game and we will see if they follow through on [[04:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17105.68s)]
*  that [[04:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17112.16s)]
*  well maybe for the abraham accords i don't want to get ahead of myself on this one but [[04:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17122.48s)]
*  they say for the abraham accords and by the way speaking of that we're going to be filling it up [[04:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17127.44s)]
*  a lot of countries want to come into the abraham of course you know we have four [[04:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17132.4s)]
*  and biden did nothing on that one too and it's the same four but they're great countries and [[04:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17136.32s)]
*  they were brave doing it and it's worked out very well and we're going to be filling up the abraham [[04:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17142.0s)]
*  accords you're going to be uh i think filling it up very rapidly could you say something about that [[04:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17146.719999999998s)]
*  there's great enormous opportunity to uh to grow the abraham accords but i would just point to one [[04:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17153.44s)]
*  thing of all the leaders in the world today no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17157.76s)]
*  them than president trump is right now we're trying that's why we're talking to iran that's [[04:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17162.56s)]
*  why we're engaged with ukraine and russia it's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking [[04:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17166.640000000003s)]
*  out and to end the ones that exist already and and again i i just think it's tremendous for our [[04:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17170.960000000003s)]
*  country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace [[04:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17175.440000000002s)]
*  so uh it's hard work mr you know marco just mentioned uh something that maybe we should [[04:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17181.04s)]
*  talk about for just a second and we could mr prime minister and you're involved in it too [[04:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17189.44s)]
*  because you've been involved in the world and peace but i think we're doing very well with respect [[04:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17193.52s)]
*  to iran and we're having very serious meetings and there are only two options and the one option is [[04:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17199.44s)]
*  not a good option it's not a not a good option at all and i think we're doing very well on a [[04:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17208.399999999998s)]
*  an agreement with iran but that one we're doing a lot of things i will say but that one is uh [[04:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17216.32s)]
*  well in its way we could have a very very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved [[04:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17223.52s)]
*  on the economy there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of march the slowest [[04:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17232.64s)]
*  pace since 2009 is that an economic indicator and perhaps the treasury secretary can weigh in on [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17238.0s)]
*  this as well is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader us no they have [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17244.0s)]
*  very good numbers on housing today extremely good numbers and that's despite interest rates because [[04:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17249.12s)]
*  you know if you look at what happened everyone said oh i said i was going to get prices down i [[04:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17254.48s)]
*  did energy just hit one dollar and 98 cents in a couple of states it's way down energies down and [[04:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17259.6s)]
*  we're about 64 dollars a barrel when i came in and we were looking at 89 90 95 dollars and by the [[04:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17266.56s)]
*  way that helps us solve the war too having those energy prices is a big a big incentive for russia [[04:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17273.52s)]
*  to also agree with solving the war problem groceries are down when i was with you two [[04:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17279.68s)]

*  housing is doing very well we should lower interest rates that's the fed i hope they lower [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=17314.239999999998s)]

*  explore if we can share experiences and we do with our colleagues in the u.s. [[05:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19062.76s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one but there can be techniques and way of working that we have [[05:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19068.679999999997s)]
*  used in organizing our fund jen stoltmer was the finance minister when the first [[05:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19075.96s)]

*  no and as you said mr prime minister we are ready to sit down with the u.s. to also work with them [[05:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19088.92s)]

*  and i think that one example of how we work together with united states is that half the [[05:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19100.28s)]
*  fund close to one trillion u.s. dollars are invested in united states mainly mainly in equity [[05:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19105.719999999998s)]
*  some fixed income including government bonds so this is an expression of trust in the united states [[05:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19113.96s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the server health fund then just briefly on ukraine since it [[05:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19121.72s)]
*  was mentioned we had a very good and extensive discussion about ukraine the path forward to [[05:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19126.76s)]

*  norway has actually tripled the military support to ukraine and this year we will allocate close [[05:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19144.44s)]
*  to eight billion u.s. dollars to ukraine that will strengthen them and also the hand on the [[05:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19150.84s)]

*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic ukraine for the future and the best [[05:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19160.28s)]

*  hope are you in agreement mr president 2018 your former secretary of state mike Pompeo called for [[05:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19202.52s)]

*  they say for the abraham accords and by the way speaking of that we're going to be filling it up [[05:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19397.96s)]
*  a lot of countries want to come into the abraham accords you know we have four [[05:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19402.92s)]

*  that's why we're engaged with ukraine and russia it's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking [[05:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19437.0s)]
*  out and to end the ones that exist already and and again i i just think it's tremendous for our [[05:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19441.48s)]
*  country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace [[05:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=19445.96s)]

*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20451.84s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[05:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20457.32s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[05:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20463.92s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[05:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20466.32s)]

*  We'll do something. [[05:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20505.88s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that over the years, the United States has been [[05:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20506.88s)]

*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[05:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20551.52s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can [[05:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20555.52s)]
*  be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[05:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20561.64s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[05:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20564.6s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[05:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20568.879999999997s)]
*  And I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[05:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20570.72s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20576.48s)]

*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[05:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20607.28s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[05:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20608.64s)]

*  We would like to have him and it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[05:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20636.8s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[05:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20642.32s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[05:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20652.48s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20658.96s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[05:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20663.76s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war, it's the soldiers. [[05:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20667.12s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been [[05:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20671.84s)]
*  spent on this war is insane. [[05:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20677.12s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[05:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20679.52s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[05:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20681.12s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. [[05:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20684.0s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[05:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20690.8s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20692.8s)]
*  It's horrible. [[05:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20695.12s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[05:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20696.8s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[05:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20698.399999999998s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[05:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20702.8s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[05:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20703.84s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[05:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20706.48s)]
*  Do you believe that Russia, that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine [[05:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20711.36s)]
*  and Europe is willing to accept? [[05:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20717.6s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[05:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20719.36s)]
*  I do. [[05:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20720.32s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[05:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20720.8s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[05:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20722.8s)]
*  I hope so. [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20724.64s)]
*  Soon. [[05:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20725.28s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[05:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20725.78s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[05:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20734.079999999998s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[05:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20736.8s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[05:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20740.16s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20742.16s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20742.879999999997s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[05:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20746.8s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[05:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20749.44s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words Vladimir, stop. [[05:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20750.239999999998s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[05:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20755.84s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[05:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20760.239999999998s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[05:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20762.559999999998s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[05:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20763.92s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[05:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20765.76s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[05:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20770.24s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[05:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20771.84s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's about. [[05:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20773.12s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[05:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20776.96s)]
*  Sorry. [[05:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20778.24s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[05:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20778.96s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[05:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20783.68s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[05:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20786.32s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[05:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20788.16s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[05:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20790.08s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[05:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20792.48s)]
*  Things will happen. [[05:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20794.24s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[05:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20795.52s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans putting a lot of pressure. [[05:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20798.96s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[05:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20801.12s)]
*  They're dealing. [[05:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20802.88s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[05:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20804.079999999998s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20806.079999999998s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[05:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20807.28s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[05:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20808.96s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[05:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20811.44s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[05:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20812.64s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[05:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20816.64s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[05:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20819.12s)]
*  He's talking and we're putting a lot of pressure. [[05:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20820.399999999998s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[05:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20822.96s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[05:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20824.16s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[05:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20825.44s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[05:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20828.24s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[05:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20830.88s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[05:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20833.600000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, you've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20835.760000000002s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[05:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20850.48s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree [[05:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20852.160000000003s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[05:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20859.84s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[05:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20864.480000000003s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Ukraine that? [[05:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20866.160000000003s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[05:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20868.800000000003s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[05:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20872.88s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[05:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20874.56s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[05:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20880.08s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[05:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20880.96s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[05:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20882.32s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[05:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20884.16s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[05:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20887.76s)]
*  He's right here. [[05:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20890.16s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[05:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20891.12s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[05:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20897.6s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[05:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20899.12s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[05:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20899.84s)]
*  And we'll get we'll do the best we can working with Ukraine. [[05:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20901.92s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[05:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20905.84s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[05:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20906.96s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[05:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20909.04s)]
*  That was had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[05:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20915.36s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[05:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20917.52s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[05:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20921.36s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[05:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20923.920000000002s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[05:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20925.120000000003s)]
*  There was no anything. [[05:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20926.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[05:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20927.2s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[05:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20928.24s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[05:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20931.2s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[05:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20934.24s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[05:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20939.04s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with this president. [[05:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20940.0s)]
*  The peace proposal that you put on the table, it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[05:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20942.24s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[05:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20945.2s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[05:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20949.52s)]
*  Immediately. [[05:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20953.04s)]
*  Russia has not. [[05:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20954.16s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, [[05:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20955.28s)]
*  just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[05:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20959.68s)]
*  I don't think so. [[05:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20962.24s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[05:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20963.12s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[05:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20965.039999999997s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[05:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20966.96s)]
*  Complicated. [[05:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20968.16s)]
*  Very complicated. [[05:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20969.28s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[05:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20970.32s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[05:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20974.32s)]
*  First of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20975.92s)]
*  that it would take to end a war. [[05:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20980.48s)]
*  This war is endable. [[05:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20982.239999999998s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[05:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20983.44s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[05:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20984.96s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20986.32s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[05:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20987.28s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[05:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20988.239999999998s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[05:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20989.92s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[05:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20991.28s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this [[05:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20992.96s)]
*  war needs to end. [[05:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20996.399999999998s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[05:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20997.12s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive [[05:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=20998.399999999998s)]
*  today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[05:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21002.16s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save [[05:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21005.76s)]
*  lives. [[05:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21009.2s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[05:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21009.52s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[05:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21011.28s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[05:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21013.36s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[05:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21015.12s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[05:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21017.04s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[05:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21019.76s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21021.92s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[05:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21023.679999999997s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[05:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21025.039999999997s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice [[05:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21027.359999999997s)]
*  people. [[05:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21031.12s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[05:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21031.359999999997s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions [[05:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21033.28s)]
*  has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[05:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21038.879999999997s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[05:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21044.32s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[05:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21046.32s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[05:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21049.359999999997s)]
*  Mr. President. [[05:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21051.36s)]
*  Mr. President. [[05:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21052.16s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from [[05:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21053.52s)]
*  the U.S.? [[05:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21060.56s)]
*  To buy more? [[05:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21062.0s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[05:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21063.760000000002s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[05:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21066.32s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[05:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21067.52s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[05:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21069.52s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[05:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21071.920000000002s)]
*  We have we've had a great relationship. [[05:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21074.24s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[05:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21076.960000000003s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[05:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21078.72s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[05:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21081.04s)]
*  You can't do better. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21082.32s)]
*  Really? [[05:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21084.16s)]
*  Not even by, say, a five-year concession? [[05:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21084.960000000003s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[05:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21087.2s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[05:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21090.4s)]
*  Yes. [[05:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21091.440000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[05:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21091.760000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[05:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21092.0s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, if I can ask both [[05:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21095.36s)]
*  you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[05:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21099.84s)]
*  Totally. [[05:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21104.88s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[05:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21105.440000000002s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say [[05:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21107.36s)]
*  he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[05:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21110.96s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[05:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21114.8s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[05:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21115.84s)]
*  Can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[05:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21121.2s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[05:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21125.92s)]
*  That is clear. [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21130.0s)]
*  That is obvious. [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21130.719999999998s)]
*  It's really happening. [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21131.84s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, [[05:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21133.52s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[05:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21137.52s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[05:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21141.04s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[05:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21143.28s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21145.6s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[05:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21147.68s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[05:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21151.44s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[05:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21154.239999999998s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[05:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21156.239999999998s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[05:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21159.52s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[05:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21164.16s)]
*  as we do much closer now. [[05:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21167.12s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being, you know, [[05:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21168.96s)]
*  open in that process. [[05:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21172.24s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[05:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21173.2s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[05:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21175.52s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[05:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21176.96s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[05:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21180.32s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world [[05:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21182.24s)]
*  to have such a broad conflict going on. [[05:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21186.08s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[05:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21188.96s)]
*  Mr. President, I have a follow-up question on China. [[05:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21192.239999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[05:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21195.92s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[05:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21200.64s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[05:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21203.2s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[05:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21204.96s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[05:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21205.92s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[05:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21207.84s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more patriot missiles. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21211.36s)]
*  Yes. [[05:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21215.6s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[05:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21216.879999999997s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[05:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21220.879999999997s)]
*  trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on patriot missiles, [[05:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21225.519999999997s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[05:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21230.0s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[05:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21233.84s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[05:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21234.8s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[05:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21236.559999999998s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[05:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21238.239999999998s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[05:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21240.32s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[05:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21244.16s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, [[05:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21246.56s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[05:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21248.32s)]
*  What does the President... [[05:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21251.28s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House [[05:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21252.24s)]
*  after Liberation Day. [[05:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21258.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[05:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21260.96s)]
*  Because I like them. [[05:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21264.4s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[05:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21266.72s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[05:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21271.2s)]
*  The King is highly respected in Norway. [[05:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21272.48s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21275.52s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[05:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21276.239999999998s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[05:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21279.28s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[05:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21281.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[05:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21284.079999999998s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[05:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21284.8s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[05:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21286.48s)]
*  President Trump, first of all, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[05:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21288.64s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, [[05:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21296.96s)]
*  the way that we have structured our funding and what our... [[05:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21300.24s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income [[05:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21305.2s)]
*  from oil and gas. [[05:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21311.68s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[05:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21313.440000000002s)]
*  dedicate, innovate, and move forward, [[05:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21316.640000000003s)]
*  despite having these incomes, [[05:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21318.960000000003s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[05:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21320.72s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[05:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21324.4s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[05:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21327.120000000003s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[05:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21330.0s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the US, [[05:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21333.76s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, [[05:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21339.199999999997s)]
*  but there can be techniques and way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[05:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21342.0s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister when the first dollar entered that fund. [[05:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21350.239999999998s)]
*  So he's a safe hand to have as a finance minister today. [[05:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21355.28s)]
*  What do you say? [[05:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21358.56s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[05:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21359.440000000002s)]
*  we are ready to sit down with the US to also work with them on if they want to establish [[05:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21361.68s)]
*  some wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[05:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21367.120000000003s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that [[05:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21370.800000000003s)]
*  half the fund, close to one trillion US dollars, [[05:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21375.600000000002s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[05:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21380.16s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government bonds. [[05:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21384.0s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, [[05:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21387.44s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[05:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21392.32s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[05:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21395.44s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, the path forward to peace. [[05:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21398.239999999998s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, we commend the US for pushing forward [[05:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21403.199999999997s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. [[05:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21407.28s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[05:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21409.52s)]
*  And they're proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[05:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21413.04s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion US dollars to Ukraine. [[05:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21418.8s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[05:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21424.399999999998s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[05:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21427.36s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[05:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21430.879999999997s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves. [[05:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21434.879999999997s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[05:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21439.12s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[05:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21440.4s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway [[05:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21444.72s)]
*  was 15 percent based upon your conversations that you've had today with the prime minister. [[05:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21450.64s)]
*  Do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[05:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21456.72s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[05:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21462.72s)]
*  It's a big fund. [[05:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21466.48s)]
*  And they don't have any debt. [[05:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21467.84s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[05:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21470.239999999998s)]
*  Aren't it today that you're in agreement with which countries? [[05:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21473.68s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian [[05:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21476.64s)]
*  occupation of Crimea. [[05:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21481.199999999997s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial [[05:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21483.28s)]
*  concessions with Ukraine? [[05:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21488.48s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[05:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21490.079999999998s)]
*  It would have never started if I were president. [[05:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21491.12s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. [[05:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21493.28s)]
*  All wars are horrible. [[05:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21496.48s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[05:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21497.52s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because [[05:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21500.079999999998s)]
*  so many lives have been lost. [[05:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21505.36s)]
*  Not only soldiers. [[05:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21507.2s)]
*  A lot of lives have been lost. [[05:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21508.32s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[05:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21511.04s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[05:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21515.6s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to. [[05:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21518.0s)]
*  And it didn't. [[05:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21519.28s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[05:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21520.16s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[05:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21521.52s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[05:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21522.8s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[05:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21524.32s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[05:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21525.68s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[05:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21526.88s)]
*  But we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[05:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21529.84s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[05:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21533.760000000002s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[05:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21537.68s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[05:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21540.16s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, what [[05:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21545.84s)]
*  happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[05:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21551.68s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. [[05:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21558.4s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[05:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21560.08s)]
*  But this isn't my war. [[05:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21562.0s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[05:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21564.0s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[05:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21565.28s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[05:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21570.96s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[05:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21574.24s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. [[05:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21577.12s)]
*  He said, this is just thank you very much. [[05:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21578.96s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the, as you know, the prime minister of Norway. [[05:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21583.84s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[05:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21590.399999999998s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia and trade doing very well, I think, on both. [[05:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21595.44s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement and every respect the war is very important. [[06:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21604.88s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week dying, young people, mostly soldiers from Russia, [[06:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21610.4s)]
*  Ukraine. [[06:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21619.84s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[06:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21621.28s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[06:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21624.64s)]
*  And I think we've made a long, a lot of progress. [[06:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21626.64s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[06:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21629.04s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[06:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21630.48s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[06:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21633.36s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade and we will definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[06:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21636.24s)]
*  We'll do something. [[06:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21644.56s)]
*  But I think the prime minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a [[06:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21645.36s)]
*  lot of people and it's time for us to benefit also. [[06:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21651.440000000002s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade and we discussed other things also. [[06:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21658.16s)]
*  But Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you the way this. [[06:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21663.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21666.800000000003s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[06:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21668.4s)]
*  This year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[06:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21670.640000000003s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[06:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21675.920000000002s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[06:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21677.52s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[06:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21679.36s)]
*  We are allies. [[06:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21682.24s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic, a lot of confidence between our services. [[06:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21683.280000000002s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[06:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21689.6s)]
*  I have saluted the president for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a [[06:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21693.84s)]
*  ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[06:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21700.16s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[06:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21702.72s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[06:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21706.88s)]
*  And then I think the president and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[06:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21708.8s)]
*  And we have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[06:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21714.72s)]
*  We can be complementary and we can find good solutions. [[06:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21721.68s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[06:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21725.920000000002s)]
*  which has been a confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[06:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21729.84s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21733.760000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[06:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21735.2s)]
*  Any questions? [[06:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21736.88s)]
*  Yes. [[06:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21737.6s)]
*  Yes. [[06:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21738.1s)]
*  Yes. [[06:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21738.6s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[06:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21739.1s)]
*  Is there a chance that you'll lower the tariffs? [[06:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21745.44s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[06:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21746.879999999997s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[06:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21751.12s)]
*  You think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[06:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21752.64s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[06:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21753.92s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[06:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21756.64s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to President Trump's? [[06:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21760.719999999998s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[06:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21763.12s)]
*  I love it. [[06:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21764.48s)]
*  I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[06:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21765.68s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[06:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21769.92s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[06:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21773.52s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[06:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21774.96s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[06:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21776.32s)]
*  Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[06:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21783.6s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[06:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21790.88s)]
*  No, we want to very simply. [[06:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21797.36s)]
*  I have no allegiance to anybody. [[06:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21799.36s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[06:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21802.16s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. [[06:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21805.52s)]
*  It's the war. [[06:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21807.84s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[06:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21809.120000000003s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been [[06:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21810.24s)]
*  spent on this war is insane. [[06:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21815.52s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[06:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21818.0s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[06:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21819.52s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. [[06:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21822.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[06:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21829.2s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[06:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21831.2s)]
*  It's horrible. [[06:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21833.52s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[06:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21835.2s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[06:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21836.8s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[06:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21841.2s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[06:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21842.24s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[06:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21844.88s)]
*  Russia, that people get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to. [[06:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21849.84s)]
*  I think so. [[06:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21857.760000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[06:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21858.32s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[06:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21859.2s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[06:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21861.2s)]
*  I hope so. [[06:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21863.04s)]
*  Soon. [[06:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21863.68s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[06:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21867.12s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[06:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21872.56s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[06:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21875.28s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[06:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21878.56s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[06:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21880.56s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[06:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21881.36s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[06:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21885.2s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[06:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21887.84s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a truth social post, you used the words, [[06:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21888.64s)]
*  Vladimir, stop. [[06:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21892.64s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[06:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21894.32s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[06:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21898.64s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[06:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21901.04s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[06:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21902.32s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[06:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21904.16s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[06:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21908.719999999998s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[06:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21910.239999999998s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's. [[06:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21911.6s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[06:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21913.359999999997s)]
*  Sorry. [[06:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21916.64s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[06:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21917.44s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[06:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21922.16s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[06:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21924.719999999998s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[06:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21926.559999999998s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[06:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21928.48s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[06:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21930.879999999997s)]
*  Things things will happen. [[06:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21932.72s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[06:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21933.920000000002s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans. [[06:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21937.2s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[06:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21938.56s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21939.52s)]
*  They're dealing. [[06:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21941.28s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21942.48s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21944.48s)]
*  And you may be telling us that. [[06:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21945.68s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[06:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21947.36s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[06:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21949.84s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21951.04s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[06:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21955.04s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21957.52s)]
*  He's talking. [[06:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21958.8s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21960.08s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[06:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21961.36s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[06:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21962.56s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21963.920000000002s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too. [[06:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21966.72s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[06:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21969.36s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[06:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21972.08s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, is the Prime Minister fine with that? [[06:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21974.16s)]
*  You've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[06:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21979.36s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[06:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21988.96s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree. [[06:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21990.48s)]
*  And he believes in the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[06:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=21998.239999999998s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[06:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22002.879999999997s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give? [[06:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22004.559999999998s)]
*  Well, the former — former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[06:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22006.64s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[06:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22011.28s)]
*  He's a — he's been a great — he's been a great general, frankly. [[06:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22012.96s)]
*  Because that's what you are, really. [[06:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22018.48s)]
*  You're a general. [[06:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22019.68s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[06:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22020.8s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[06:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22022.56s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[06:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22026.16s)]
*  He's right here. [[06:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22028.64s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[06:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22029.52s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[06:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22036.0s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[06:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22037.52s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[06:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22038.24s)]
*  And we'll get — we'll do the best we can. [[06:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22040.32s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[06:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22042.48s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[06:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22045.36s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[06:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22047.440000000002s)]
*  That was — had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[06:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22053.760000000002s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[06:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22055.920000000002s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[06:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22059.760000000002s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[06:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22062.32s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[06:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22063.52s)]
*  There was no anything. [[06:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22064.8s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[06:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22065.600000000002s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[06:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22066.72s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[06:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22069.600000000002s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[06:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22072.640000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[06:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22077.52s)]
*  Mr. President, I had a long meeting with this president. [[06:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22078.4s)]
*  The peace proposal that you put on the table, it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[06:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22080.640000000003s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[06:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22083.68s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[06:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22088.0s)]
*  Immediately. [[06:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22091.52s)]
*  Russia has not. [[06:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22092.640000000003s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, [[06:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22093.760000000002s)]
*  just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[06:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22098.16s)]
*  I don't think so. [[06:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22100.72s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[06:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22101.52s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[06:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22103.44s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[06:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22105.36s)]
*  Complicated. [[06:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22106.56s)]
*  Very complicated. [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22107.68s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[06:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22108.72s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[06:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22112.72s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things [[06:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22114.16s)]
*  that it would take to end a war. [[06:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22118.88s)]
*  This war is endable. [[06:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22120.64s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[06:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22121.84s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[06:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22123.36s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[06:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22124.64s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[06:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22125.68s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[06:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22126.64s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[06:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22128.32s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[06:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22129.68s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this [[06:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22131.36s)]
*  war needs to end. [[06:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22134.8s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[06:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22135.600000000002s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive [[06:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22136.88s)]
*  today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[06:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22140.56s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save [[06:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22144.16s)]
*  lives. [[06:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22147.600000000002s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[06:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22147.920000000002s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[06:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22149.760000000002s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[06:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22151.84s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[06:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22153.52s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[06:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22155.52s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[06:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22158.16s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[06:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22160.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[06:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22162.16s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[06:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22163.52s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice [[06:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22165.84s)]
*  people. [[06:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22169.52s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on them. [[06:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22169.84s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions [[06:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22171.52s)]
*  has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[06:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22177.36s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[06:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22182.800000000003s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[06:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22184.72s)]

*  If you are going to take on the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the [[06:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22191.92s)]
*  U.S.? [[06:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22199.12s)]
*  To buy more? [[06:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22200.48s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[06:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22202.16s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[06:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22204.719999999998s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[06:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22205.92s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[06:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22207.92s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[06:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22210.32s)]

*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[06:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22215.44s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[06:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22217.12s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[06:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22219.52s)]
*  You can't do better. [[06:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22221.68s)]
*  Really? [[06:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22223.12s)]
*  Nothing by, say, fighting? [[06:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22223.52s)]
*  They want to give us some additional concessions. [[06:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22225.68s)]
*  That's okay. [[06:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22227.68s)]

*  Yes. [[06:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22229.92s)]
*  Yes. [[06:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22230.16s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[06:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22230.399999999998s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, if I can ask both [[06:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22233.76s)]
*  you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[06:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22238.239999999998s)]
*  Totally. [[06:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22243.36s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[06:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22243.84s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say [[06:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22245.760000000002s)]
*  he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[06:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22249.36s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[06:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22253.2s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[06:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22254.24s)]
*  Can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[06:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22259.600000000002s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[06:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22264.32s)]
*  That is clear. [[06:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22268.4s)]
*  That is obvious. [[06:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22269.12s)]
*  It's really happening. [[06:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22269.84s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, [[06:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22272.0s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[06:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22276.0s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[06:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22279.52s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[06:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22281.68s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[06:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22284.0s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[06:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22286.16s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[06:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22289.84s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[06:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22292.64s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[06:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22294.72s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[06:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22297.92s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[06:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22302.559999999998s)]
*  as we do much closer now. [[06:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22305.519999999997s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being, you know, opening that process. [[06:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22307.359999999997s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[06:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22311.6s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[06:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22313.92s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[06:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22315.359999999997s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[06:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22318.719999999998s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world [[06:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22320.64s)]
*  to have such a broad conflict going on. [[06:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22324.48s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22327.36s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[06:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22330.72s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[06:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22334.32s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[06:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22339.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[06:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22341.600000000002s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[06:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22343.36s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[06:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22344.32s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[06:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22346.24s)]
*  Oh, well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more hatred missiles. [[06:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22349.600000000002s)]
*  Yes. [[06:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22354.08s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[06:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22355.28s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[06:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22359.28s)]
*  trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on hatred missiles, [[06:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22363.92s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[06:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22368.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[06:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22372.24s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[06:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22373.2s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[06:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22374.96s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[06:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22376.64s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[06:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22378.72s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[06:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22382.56s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, [[06:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22384.960000000003s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[06:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22386.72s)]
*  What does the President... [[06:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22389.760000000002s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House [[06:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22390.640000000003s)]
*  after the liberation day. [[06:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22396.800000000003s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[06:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22399.36s)]
*  Because I like them. [[06:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22402.88s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[06:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22405.120000000003s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[06:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22409.600000000002s)]
*  The King is highly respected in Norway. [[06:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22410.960000000003s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[06:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22413.920000000002s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[06:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22414.64s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[06:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22417.68s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[06:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22419.440000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. [[06:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22422.48s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[06:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22423.2s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[06:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22424.88s)]
*  President Trump, one point more on the... [[06:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22427.04s)]
*  You said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[06:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22430.64s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, [[06:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22435.36s)]
*  the way that we have structured our money and what our... [[06:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22438.72s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s [[06:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22443.6s)]
*  to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[06:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22447.44s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[06:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22451.84s)]
*  dedicate, innovate, and move forward, [[06:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22455.04s)]
*  despite having these incomes, [[06:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22457.36s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[06:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22459.2s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[06:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22462.88s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22465.52s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[06:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22468.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, [[06:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22472.16s)]
*  and we do with our colleagues in the US, [[06:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22474.08s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, [[06:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22477.6s)]
*  but there can be techniques and a way of working [[06:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22480.4s)]
*  that we have used in organizing our fund. [[06:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22483.6s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister [[06:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22488.72s)]
*  when the first dollar entered that fund. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22490.72s)]
*  So he is a safe hand to have as a finance minister today. [[06:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22493.68s)]
*  What do you say? [[06:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22496.96s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[06:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22497.84s)]
*  we are ready to sit down with the US [[06:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22500.079999999998s)]
*  to also work with them on if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, [[06:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22502.559999999998s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[06:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22506.559999999998s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States [[06:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22509.2s)]
*  is that half the fund, close to one trillion US dollars, [[06:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22513.28s)]
*  are invested in the United States, [[06:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22518.559999999998s)]
*  mainly in equity, but also some in fixed income, [[06:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22521.52s)]
*  including government bonds. [[06:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22524.719999999998s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States [[06:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22525.84s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[06:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22530.72s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[06:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22533.84s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[06:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22536.72s)]
*  the path forward to peace. [[06:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22539.68s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, [[06:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22541.6s)]
*  we commend the US for pushing forward [[06:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22543.28s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. [[06:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22545.68s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[06:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22548.0s)]
*  And therefore, I'm proud that Norway [[06:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22551.36s)]
*  has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[06:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22553.84s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion US dollars to Ukraine. [[06:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22557.2s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[06:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22562.72s)]
*  I may add to that, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[06:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22565.52s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[06:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22569.28s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have [[06:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22573.28s)]
*  is the ability to defend themselves. [[06:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22575.76s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[06:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22577.52s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister. [[06:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22578.72s)]
*  As it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[06:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22581.12s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, [[06:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22583.04s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[06:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22586.8s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the prime minister, [[06:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22590.96s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[06:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22595.120000000003s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[06:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22601.04s)]
*  It's a big fund. [[06:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22604.88s)]
*  And they don't have any debt. [[06:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22606.24s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[06:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22608.64s)]
*  Are you saying that the president of which country? [[06:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22612.160000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[06:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22615.120000000003s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo [[06:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22615.36s)]
*  called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[06:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22618.320000000003s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance [[06:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22621.760000000002s)]
*  on territorial concessions? [[06:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22626.08s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[06:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22628.56s)]
*  It would have never started if I were president. [[06:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22629.600000000002s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. [[06:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22631.760000000002s)]
*  All wars are horrible. [[06:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22634.960000000003s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[06:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22636.0s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because [[06:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22638.48s)]
*  so many lives have been lost. [[06:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22643.84s)]
*  Not only soldiers. [[06:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22645.6s)]
*  A lot of lives have been lost. [[06:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22646.8s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[06:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22649.44s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[06:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22654.0s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to. [[06:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22656.399999999998s)]
*  And it didn't. [[06:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22657.76s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[06:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22658.559999999998s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[06:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22660.0s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[06:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22661.199999999997s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[06:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22662.719999999998s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[06:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22664.079999999998s)]
*  Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never there was never even a thought that [[06:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22666.32s)]
*  he'd go in. [[06:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22671.12s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[06:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22672.16s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[06:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22676.08s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[06:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22678.56s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country. [[06:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22684.24s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were given up. [[06:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22689.84s)]
*  And it was called Crimea. [[06:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22694.08s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. [[06:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22696.800000000003s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[06:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22698.480000000003s)]
*  But this is in my war. [[06:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22700.4s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[06:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22702.4s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[06:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22703.68s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[06:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22709.36s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[06:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22712.640000000003s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. [[06:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22715.52s)]
*  He said, this is just a point in time. [[06:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22717.36s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[06:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22720.160000000003s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[06:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22722.0s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[06:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22733.12s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[06:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22734.0s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[06:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22736.48s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. [[06:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22738.399999999998s)]
*  But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[06:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22740.0s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[06:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22748.16s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[06:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22748.960000000003s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[06:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22751.600000000002s)]
*  That would be nice. [[06:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22753.84s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[06:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22754.56s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[06:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22755.920000000002s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[06:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22759.120000000003s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[06:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22761.2s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[06:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22765.280000000002s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[06:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22767.52s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[06:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22773.280000000002s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week [[06:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22776.8s)]
*  as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[06:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22781.36s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. [[06:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22785.2s)]
*  They came with their A game. [[06:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22787.84s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[06:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22789.44s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[06:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22802.0s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one. [[06:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22804.239999999998s)]
*  They say for the Abraham Accords. [[06:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22806.96s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[06:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22809.04s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[06:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22811.84s)]
*  You know we have four. [[06:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22814.32s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[06:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22815.84s)]
*  It's the same four. [[06:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22818.64s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. [[06:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22820.32s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[06:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22822.8s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[06:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22824.16s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[06:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22826.64s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[06:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22831.6s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[06:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22832.96s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[06:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22836.239999999998s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, [[06:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22838.0s)]
*  no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them [[06:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22839.44s)]
*  than President Trump is right now. [[06:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22842.239999999998s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[06:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22844.719999999998s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[06:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22845.92s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out [[06:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22848.32s)]
*  and to end the ones that exist already. [[06:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22850.64s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country [[06:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22852.399999999998s)]
*  to be led by a president who desires to bring peace [[06:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22855.52s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. [[06:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22858.48s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[06:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22860.559999999998s)]
*  Mr. President. [[06:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22863.2s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something [[06:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22864.559999999998s)]
*  that maybe we should talk about for just a second, [[06:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22867.44s)]
*  if we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[06:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22870.399999999998s)]
*  And you're involved in it too, [[06:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22871.92s)]
*  because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[06:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22873.12s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. [[06:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22876.559999999998s)]
*  And we're having very serious meetings. [[06:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22880.64s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[06:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22884.48s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[06:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22886.48s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[06:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22888.96s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[06:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22892.64s)]
*  But that one — we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[06:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22897.6s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[06:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22900.719999999998s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision. [[06:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22903.92s)]
*  And a lot of lives will be saved. [[06:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22906.64s)]

*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown [[06:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22911.519999999997s)]
*  as it relates to home sales in the month of March — [[06:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22914.239999999998s)]
*  the slowest pace since 2009. [[06:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22916.8s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator — [[06:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22919.68s)]
*  and perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well — [[06:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22921.28s)]
*  is that an economic indicator that concerns you [[06:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22924.399999999998s)]
*  about the broader U.S. economy? [[06:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22926.96s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today. [[06:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22928.32s)]
*  Extremely good numbers. [[06:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22930.399999999998s)]

*  Because, you know, if you look at what happened, [[06:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22933.68s)]
*  everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[06:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22936.16s)]
*  I did. [[06:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22939.039999999997s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[06:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22939.84s)]
*  It's way down. [[06:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22943.6s)]
*  Energy is down. [[06:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22944.879999999997s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[06:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22945.68s)]
*  When I came in, and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[06:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22948.64s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[06:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22952.48s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia [[06:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22954.719999999998s)]
*  to also agree with solving the war problem. [[06:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22959.199999999997s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[06:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22963.039999999997s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, [[06:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22964.719999999998s)]
*  you were complaining about eggs. [[06:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22967.679999999997s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[06:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22970.0s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week [[06:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22971.28s)]
*  when the press started saying about eggs [[06:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22973.44s)]
*  have gone through the roof. [[06:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22976.16s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[06:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22977.04s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[06:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22978.08s)]
*  And they happened. [[06:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22979.36s)]
*  They were — they went through the roof, [[06:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22980.08s)]
*  and you couldn't get them. [[06:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22981.440000000002s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[06:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22982.72s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[06:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22986.64s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[06:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22989.04s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[06:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22991.760000000002s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[06:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22993.760000000002s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[06:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22995.84s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[06:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22997.36s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[06:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=22998.48s)]
*  That's a smart thing to do. [[06:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23000.0s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit. [[06:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23001.280000000002s)]
*  Although, already, it's a little bit late. [[06:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23002.16s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, [[06:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23004.48s)]
*  a very strong country, and we have every other country — [[06:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23007.12s)]
*  I can't think of one country [[06:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23010.32s)]
*  that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[06:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23011.6s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal [[06:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23014.399999999998s)]
*  or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[06:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23016.879999999997s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — [[06:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23019.199999999997s)]
*  it would be physically impossible. [[06:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23021.92s)]
*  You know, you have so many people [[06:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23023.92s)]
*  that really understand it, [[06:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23025.039999999997s)]
*  which is a very small group of people here. [[06:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23026.8s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, [[06:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23029.679999999997s)]
*  set prices for deals. [[06:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23032.56s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[06:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23035.36s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[06:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23037.44s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[06:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23039.2s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[06:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23041.52s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off [[06:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23043.52s)]
*  like no country probably in the history of the world [[06:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23045.2s)]
*  has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[06:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23047.52s)]
*  And countries have gone rich [[06:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23051.2s)]
*  by doing that with the United States. [[06:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23053.04s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[06:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23055.6s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[06:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23057.2s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[06:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23059.36s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do, [[06:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23062.4s)]
*  where we virtually take care of their military [[06:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23065.04s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[06:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23067.52s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[06:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23069.68s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk [[06:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23072.56s)]
*  right behind you. [[06:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23075.12s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[06:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23076.48s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[06:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23080.48s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[06:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23085.28s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[06:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23089.28s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[06:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23093.28s)]
*  But I don't blame any country. [[06:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23097.84s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[06:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23100.64s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[06:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23101.92s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States [[06:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23104.0s)]
*  that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[06:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23106.64s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[06:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23109.6s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[06:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23110.8s)]
*  We had the most successful economy [[06:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23112.8s)]
*  in the history of our country my first term. [[06:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23114.559999999998s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23117.28s)]
*  With China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions [[06:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23119.04s)]
*  of dollars in tariffs. [[06:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23121.84s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[06:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23123.52s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[06:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23125.04s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[06:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23128.0s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[06:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23131.36s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[06:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23134.88s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[06:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23138.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23139.68s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[06:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23141.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23143.12s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — [[06:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23149.12s)]
*  as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[06:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23152.719999999998s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, [[06:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23155.76s)]
*  beloved in his country. [[06:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23158.559999999998s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, [[06:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23160.719999999998s)]
*  and trade. [[06:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23166.64s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[06:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23168.079999999998s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[06:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23170.239999999998s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[06:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23172.8s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week [[06:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23175.68s)]
*  dying — young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[06:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23181.12s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[06:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23186.559999999998s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[06:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23189.92s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[06:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23191.92s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[06:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23194.32s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[06:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23195.76s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[06:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23198.64s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — [[06:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23201.52s)]
*  definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[06:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23207.12s)]
*  We'll do something. [[06:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23209.84s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, [[06:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23210.64s)]
*  the United States has been very good to a lot of — a lot of people. [[06:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23215.04s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[06:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23218.96s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[06:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23223.52s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[06:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23225.76s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you, the White House. [[06:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23228.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23232.079999999998s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[06:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23233.679999999997s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years [[06:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23234.8s)]
*  since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[06:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23237.199999999997s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[06:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23241.199999999997s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[06:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23242.8s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[06:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23244.64s)]
*  We are allies. [[06:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23247.519999999997s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[06:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23248.559999999998s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[06:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23251.92s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[06:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23254.879999999997s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative [[06:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23259.12s)]
*  to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire [[06:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23262.16s)]
*  and an end to this terrible conflict. [[06:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23266.48s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[06:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23268.079999999998s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[06:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23272.16s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team [[06:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23274.079999999998s)]
*  have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[06:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23275.92s)]
*  And today, we have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[06:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23280.08s)]
*  We can be complementary and we can find good solutions. [[06:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23287.04s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, [[06:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23291.28s)]
*  the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[06:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23293.12s)]
*  which has been a confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[06:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23295.2s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[06:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23299.12s)]
*  Any questions? [[06:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23302.24s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the terror [[06:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23302.96s)]
*  that you want to impose on Norway? [[06:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23308.64s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[06:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23312.16s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[06:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23316.48s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[06:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23319.2s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. [[06:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23328.399999999998s)]
*  I mean, I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[06:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23330.399999999998s)]
*  They have told the President that, you know, [[06:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23334.48s)]
*  he is receiving us early in the term. [[06:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23337.04s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[06:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23338.8s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[06:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23340.32s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[06:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23341.68s)]
*  Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[06:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23348.88s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[06:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23356.16s)]
*  No, we want to very simply. I have no allegiance to anybody. [[06:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23362.64s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[06:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23367.52s)]
*  A lot of young people's mostly young people. [[06:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23370.88s)]
*  It's the war. It's the soldiers. [[06:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23373.2s)]
*  And if we can do that also, as you know, I got started because [[06:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23375.6s)]
*  the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[06:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23380.0s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[06:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23383.28s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were president. [[06:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23384.88s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this. [[06:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23387.76s)]
*  And it's a shame. [[06:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23391.92s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[06:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23394.559999999998s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[06:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23396.559999999998s)]
*  It's horrible. [[06:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23398.8s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[06:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23400.48s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[06:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23402.079999999998s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[06:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23406.48s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[06:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23407.6s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[06:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23410.239999999998s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[06:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23412.88s)]
*  I think so. [[06:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23423.04s)]
*  I do. I believe they will accept. [[06:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23424.0s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[06:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23426.48s)]
*  I hope so. Soon. [[06:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23428.32s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[06:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23432.399999999998s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[06:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23437.76s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[06:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23440.56s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[06:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23443.84s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[06:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23445.920000000002s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[06:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23446.640000000003s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[06:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23450.56s)]
*  Here, please go ahead. [[06:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23453.2s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Social Post, you used the words, [[06:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23453.920000000002s)]
*  Vladimir, stop. [[06:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23457.920000000002s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[06:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23459.600000000002s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[06:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23464.0s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[06:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23466.32s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[06:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23467.68s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[06:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23469.440000000002s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[06:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23474.0s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[06:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23475.52s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's about. [[06:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23476.88s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[06:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23480.16s)]
*  Sorry. If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[06:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23481.920000000002s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[06:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23487.440000000002s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[06:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23490.0s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[06:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23491.920000000002s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[06:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23493.760000000002s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[06:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23496.16s)]
*  Things will happen. [[06:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23498.079999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[06:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23499.28s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[06:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23502.559999999998s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23504.8s)]
*  They're dealing. [[06:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23506.64s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23507.84s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23509.76s)]
*  And you may be telling us that. [[06:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23511.039999999997s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[06:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23512.719999999998s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[06:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23515.2s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23516.399999999998s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[06:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23520.399999999998s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23522.8s)]
*  He's talking. [[06:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23524.16s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23525.36s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[06:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23526.72s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[06:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23527.920000000002s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[06:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23529.2s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[06:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23532.0s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[06:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23534.64s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[06:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23537.36s)]
*  Mr. President, you've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, [[06:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23539.52s)]
*  among them Crimea. [[06:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23552.800000000003s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[06:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23554.24s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree, [[06:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23555.84s)]
*  and he believes in the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[06:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23563.6s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[06:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23568.16s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give? [[06:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23569.920000000002s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[06:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23572.48s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[06:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23576.56s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[06:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23578.32s)]
*  It was because that's what you are. [[06:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23583.28s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[06:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23584.72s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[06:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23586.08s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[06:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23587.84s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[06:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23591.440000000002s)]
*  He's right here. [[06:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23593.920000000002s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[06:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23594.88s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[06:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23601.280000000002s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[06:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23602.88s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[06:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23603.600000000002s)]
*  And we'll get we'll do the best we can working with Ukraine. [[06:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23605.68s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[06:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23609.600000000002s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[06:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23610.72s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[06:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23612.8s)]
*  That was had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[06:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23619.04s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23621.2s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[06:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23625.04s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[06:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23627.6s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[06:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23628.88s)]
*  There was no anything. [[06:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23630.16s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[06:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23630.96s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[06:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23632.0s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[06:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23634.96s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[06:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23638.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[06:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23642.8s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a bomb-beating proposal that you put on the table. [[06:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23643.76s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[06:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23647.039999999997s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[06:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23648.96s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[06:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23653.28s)]
*  Immediately. [[06:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23656.8s)]
*  Russia has not. [[06:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23657.92s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, [[06:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23659.039999999997s)]
*  just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[06:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23663.44s)]
*  I don't think so. [[06:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23666.0s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[06:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23666.88s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[06:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23668.8s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[06:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23670.72s)]
*  Complicated. [[06:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23671.920000000002s)]
*  Very complicated. [[06:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23673.04s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make it. [[06:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23674.08s)]
*  And Marco, what would you say? [[06:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23677.84s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things [[06:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23679.600000000002s)]
*  that it would take to end a war. [[06:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23684.24s)]
*  This war is endable. [[06:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23685.920000000002s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[06:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23687.2s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[06:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23688.64s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[06:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23690.0s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[06:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23691.04s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[06:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23692.0s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[06:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23693.68s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[06:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23694.960000000003s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this [[06:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23696.56s)]
*  war needs to end. [[06:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23700.08s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[06:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23700.88s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today [[06:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23702.08s)]
*  because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[06:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23706.640000000003s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[06:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23709.440000000002s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[06:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23713.2s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[06:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23715.04s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[06:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23717.120000000003s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[06:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23718.800000000003s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[06:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23720.800000000003s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[06:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23723.440000000002s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[06:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23725.68s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[06:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23727.44s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[06:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23728.88s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, [[06:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23731.12s)]
*  then we are nice people. [[06:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23734.08s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[06:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23735.12s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, [[06:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23738.16s)]
*  what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[06:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23741.12s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[06:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23748.08s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[06:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23750.0s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[06:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23753.04s)]
*  Mr. President. [[06:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23754.88s)]
*  Mr. President. [[06:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23755.84s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, [[06:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23757.280000000002s)]
*  what do you want Norway to buy more of from the US? [[06:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23760.800000000003s)]
*  To buy more? [[06:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23765.760000000002s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[06:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23767.52s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[06:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23770.08s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[06:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23771.280000000002s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[06:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23773.280000000002s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[06:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23775.68s)]
*  We have, we've had a great relationship. [[06:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23778.0s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[06:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23780.72s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[06:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23782.48s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[06:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23784.8s)]
*  You can't do better. [[06:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23786.96s)]
*  Really? [[06:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23787.84s)]
*  Nothing by, say, a fine- [[06:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23789.04s)]
*  They want to give us some additional concessions. [[06:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23791.04s)]
*  That's okay. [[06:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23792.96s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[06:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23794.16s)]
*  Yes. [[06:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23795.2s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[06:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23795.52s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[06:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23799.12s)]
*  But on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23801.44s)]
*  did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[06:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23805.04s)]
*  Totally. [[06:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23808.64s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[06:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23809.2s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say [[06:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23811.12s)]
*  he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[06:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23814.72s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[06:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23818.56s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[06:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23819.6s)]
*  Can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[06:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23824.96s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[06:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23829.68s)]
*  That is clear. [[06:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23833.76s)]
*  That is obvious. [[06:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23834.48s)]
*  It's really happening. [[06:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23835.2s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know [[06:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23837.28s)]
*  that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[06:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23840.08s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[06:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23844.800000000003s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[06:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23846.960000000003s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[06:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23849.280000000002s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[06:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23851.440000000002s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[06:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23855.2s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[06:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23858.0s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[06:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23860.0s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[06:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23863.2s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[06:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23867.84s)]
*  as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump [[06:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23870.8s)]
*  for being open in that process. [[06:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23874.8s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[06:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23876.88s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[06:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23879.2s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[06:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23880.64s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[06:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23884.0s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world [[06:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23885.920000000002s)]
*  to have such a broad conflict going on. [[06:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23889.76s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[06:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23892.64s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[06:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23896.4s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[06:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23899.600000000002s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[06:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23904.320000000003s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[06:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23906.88s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[06:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23908.72s)]
*  It happens sometimes. [[06:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23909.68s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[06:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23911.52s)]
*  Oh, well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more patriot missiles. [[06:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23914.960000000003s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[06:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23920.56s)]
*  If you and the United States decide to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[06:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23924.56s)]
*  trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on patriot missiles, [[06:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23929.2s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[06:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23933.68s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[06:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23937.52s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[06:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23938.48s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[06:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23940.24s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[06:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23941.920000000002s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[06:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23944.0s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[06:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23947.84s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, [[06:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23950.24s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[06:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23952.0s)]
*  What does the President... [[06:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23955.04s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House [[06:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23956.0s)]
*  after the liberation day. [[06:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23962.08s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[06:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23964.64s)]
*  Because I like them. [[06:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23968.16s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[06:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23970.48s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[06:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23974.96s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[06:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23977.44s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[06:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23979.2s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[06:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23979.92s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[06:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23982.96s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[06:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23984.719999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[06:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23987.76s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[06:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23988.48s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[06:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23990.16s)]
*  President Trump, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[06:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=23992.96s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, [[06:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24000.64s)]
*  the way that we have structured our economy and what are the things? [[06:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24003.92s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations [[06:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24008.88s)]
*  the income from our oil and gas. [[06:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24014.8s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[06:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24017.2s)]
*  dedicate, innovate, and move forward despite having these incomes, [[06:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24020.32s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[06:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24024.48s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[06:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24028.16s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[06:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24030.88s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[06:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24033.68s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the US, [[06:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24037.44s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and way of working [[06:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24042.879999999997s)]
*  that we have used in organizing our fund. [[06:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24048.879999999997s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund. [[06:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24054.0s)]
*  So he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. [[06:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24059.039999999997s)]
*  What do you say? [[06:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24062.239999999998s)]
*  As you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the US [[06:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24063.84s)]
*  to also work with them if they want to establish a wealth of fund, [[06:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24067.84s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[06:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24071.84s)]
*  I think that one example of how we work together with the United States [[06:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24075.84s)]
*  is that half the fund, close to one trillion US dollars, [[06:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24078.64s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[06:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24083.84s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government bonds. [[06:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24087.760000000002s)]
*  This is an expression of trust in the United States [[06:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24091.92s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[06:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24096.0s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[06:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24099.12s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, the path forward to peace. [[06:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24102.0s)]
*  And as the Prime Minister said, we commend the US for pushing forward [[06:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24106.879999999997s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. [[06:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24110.96s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[06:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24113.28s)]
*  And therefore, I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[06:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24116.800000000003s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion US dollars to Ukraine. [[06:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24122.56s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[06:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24128.08s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[06:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24131.04s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[06:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24134.56s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves. [[06:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24138.64s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[06:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24142.800000000003s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[06:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24144.16s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[06:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24148.4s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[06:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24156.32s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[06:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24160.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[06:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24166.4s)]
*  It's a big fund. [[06:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24170.16s)]
*  And they don't have any debt. [[06:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24171.6s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[06:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24173.92s)]
*  Are you talking about the agreement of which countries? [[06:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24177.04s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian [[06:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24180.399999999998s)]
*  occupation of Crimea. [[06:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24184.96s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial [[06:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24187.04s)]
*  concessions with Russia? [[06:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24192.16s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[06:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24193.76s)]
*  It would have never started if I were president. [[06:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24194.879999999997s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. [[06:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24196.96s)]
*  All wars are horrible. [[06:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24200.24s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[06:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24201.280000000002s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because [[06:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24203.84s)]
*  so many lives have been lost. [[06:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24209.120000000003s)]
*  Not only soldiers. [[06:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24210.960000000003s)]
*  A lot of lives have been lost. [[06:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24212.08s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[06:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24214.72s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[06:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24219.36s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to. [[06:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24221.68s)]
*  And it didn't. [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24223.04s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24223.920000000002s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[06:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24225.280000000002s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[06:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24226.480000000003s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[06:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24228.08s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[06:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24229.440000000002s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[06:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24230.640000000003s)]
*  But we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24233.600000000002s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[06:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24237.440000000002s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[06:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24241.440000000002s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[06:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24243.920000000002s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, what [[06:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24249.600000000002s)]
*  happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[06:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24255.44s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. [[06:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24262.16s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[06:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24263.84s)]
*  But this isn't my war. [[06:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24265.76s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[06:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24267.76s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24269.039999999997s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[06:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24274.719999999998s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[06:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24278.0s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. [[06:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24280.879999999997s)]
*  He said, This is just a point in time. [[06:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24282.72s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[06:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24285.440000000002s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[06:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24287.2s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[06:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24298.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[06:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24299.280000000002s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[06:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24301.760000000002s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. [[06:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24303.68s)]
*  But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[06:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24305.280000000002s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24313.440000000002s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[06:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24314.24s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[06:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24316.88s)]
*  That would be nice. [[06:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24319.120000000003s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[06:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24319.920000000002s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[06:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24321.2s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[06:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24324.48s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads in great deals. [[06:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24326.48s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[06:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24330.56s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[06:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24332.800000000003s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[06:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24338.56s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week [[06:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24342.08s)]
*  as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[06:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24346.640000000003s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. [[06:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24350.480000000003s)]
*  They came with their A game. [[06:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24353.120000000003s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[06:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24354.72s)]
*  Do I deserve the no no? [[06:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24364.72s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[06:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24367.280000000002s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one. [[06:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24369.52s)]
*  They say for the Abraham Accords. [[06:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24372.24s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[06:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24374.4s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[06:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24377.2s)]
*  You know we have four. [[06:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24379.6s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[06:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24381.2s)]
*  It's the same four. [[06:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24384.0s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. [[06:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24385.68s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[06:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24388.08s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[06:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24389.44s)]
*  You're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[06:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24391.920000000002s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[06:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24396.88s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[06:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24398.32s)]
*  But I would point to one thing. [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24401.6s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder [[06:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24403.28s)]
*  to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[06:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24406.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[06:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24410.079999999998s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[06:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24411.28s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24413.6s)]
*  and to end the ones that exist already. [[06:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24415.92s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country [[06:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24417.76s)]
*  to be led by a president who desires to bring peace [[06:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24420.88s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. [[06:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24423.76s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24425.84s)]
*  Mr. President. [[06:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24428.56s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something [[06:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24429.92s)]
*  that maybe we should talk about for just a second, [[06:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24432.8s)]
*  if we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[06:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24435.76s)]
*  And you're involved in it too, [[06:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24437.2s)]
*  because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[06:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24438.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. [[06:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24441.92s)]
*  And we're having very serious meetings. [[06:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24446.0s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[06:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24449.76s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[06:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24451.76s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[06:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24454.32s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[06:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24458.0s)]
*  But that one — we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[06:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24462.96s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[06:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24466.079999999998s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision. [[06:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24469.28s)]
*  And a lot of lives will be saved. [[06:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24471.92s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown, [[06:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24474.0s)]
*  as it relates to home sales in the month of March, [[06:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24479.52s)]
*  the slowest pace since 2009. [[06:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24482.16s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator — [[06:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24484.960000000003s)]
*  and perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well — [[06:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24486.64s)]
*  is that an economic indicator that concerns you [[06:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24489.68s)]
*  about the broader U.S. economy? [[06:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24492.24s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today. [[06:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24493.600000000002s)]
*  Extremely good numbers. [[06:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24495.68s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates. [[06:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24497.2s)]
*  Because, you know, if you look at what happened, [[06:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24498.960000000003s)]
*  everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[06:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24501.440000000002s)]
*  I did. [[06:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24504.32s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[06:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24505.120000000003s)]
*  It's way down. [[06:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24508.960000000003s)]
*  Energy is down. [[06:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24510.16s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[06:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24510.960000000003s)]
*  When I came in, and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[06:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24513.920000000002s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[06:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24517.760000000002s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia [[06:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24520.0s)]
*  to also agree with solving the war problem. [[06:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24524.48s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[06:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24528.32s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, [[06:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24530.0s)]
*  you were complaining about eggs. [[06:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24532.96s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[06:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24535.280000000002s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week [[06:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24536.56s)]
*  when the press started saying about eggs [[06:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24538.72s)]
*  have gone through the roof. [[06:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24541.440000000002s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[06:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24542.32s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[06:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24543.36s)]
*  And they happened. [[06:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24544.64s)]
*  They were — they went through the roof, [[06:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24545.36s)]
*  and you couldn't get them. [[06:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24546.72s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[06:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24548.0s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[06:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24552.0s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[06:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24554.32s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[06:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24557.04s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[06:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24559.04s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[06:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24561.12s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[06:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24562.64s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[06:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24563.76s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[06:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24565.28s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit. [[06:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24566.56s)]
*  Although, already, it's a little bit late. [[06:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24567.44s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, [[06:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24569.76s)]
*  a very strong country. [[06:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24572.48s)]
*  And we have every other country — [[06:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24573.6s)]
*  I can't think of one country [[06:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24575.6s)]
*  that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[06:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24576.879999999997s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal [[06:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24579.68s)]
*  or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[06:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24582.239999999998s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — [[06:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24584.48s)]
*  it would be physically impossible. [[06:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24587.28s)]
*  You know, you have so many people [[06:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24589.2s)]
*  that really understand it, [[06:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24590.399999999998s)]
*  which is a very small group of people here. [[06:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24592.16s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, [[06:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24594.96s)]
*  just set prices for deals. [[06:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24597.6s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[06:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24600.64s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[06:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24602.8s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[06:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24604.48s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[06:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24606.8s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off [[06:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24608.8s)]
*  like no country, probably, in the history of the world [[06:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24610.48s)]
*  has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[06:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24612.8s)]
*  And countries have gone rich [[06:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24616.559999999998s)]
*  by doing that with the United States. [[06:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24618.32s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[06:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24620.879999999997s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[06:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24622.559999999998s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject [[06:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24624.719999999998s)]
*  to any of the deals. [[06:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24626.0s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do, [[06:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24627.68s)]
*  where we virtually take care of their military [[06:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24630.32s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[06:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24632.8s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[06:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24634.96s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk [[06:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24637.84s)]
*  right behind you. [[06:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24640.399999999998s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[06:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24641.76s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[06:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24645.76s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[06:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24650.559999999998s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[06:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24654.56s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[06:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24658.56s)]
*  But I don't blame any country — not the worst of them. [[06:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24663.120000000003s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[06:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24667.2s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States [[06:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24669.280000000002s)]
*  that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24671.920000000002s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[06:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24674.88s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[06:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24676.08s)]
*  We had the most successful economy [[06:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24678.0s)]
*  in the history of our country my first term. [[06:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24679.84s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[06:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24682.56s)]
*  With China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions [[06:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24684.32s)]
*  of dollars in tariffs. [[06:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24687.12s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[06:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24688.8s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[06:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24690.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[06:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24693.28s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[06:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24696.64s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[06:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24700.16s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[06:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24703.44s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24704.96s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[06:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24705.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24707.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24708.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — [[06:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24714.4s)]
*  as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[06:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24718.0s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, [[06:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24721.04s)]
*  beloved in his country. [[06:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24723.84s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, [[06:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24726.0s)]
*  and trade — doing very well, I think, on both. [[06:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24731.920000000002s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[06:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24735.440000000002s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[06:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24738.08s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week dying — [[06:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24741.2s)]
*  young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[06:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24746.8s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[06:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24751.84s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[06:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24755.2s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[06:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24757.120000000003s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[06:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24759.600000000002s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[06:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24761.04s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[06:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24763.84s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — [[06:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24766.72s)]
*  definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[06:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24772.32s)]
*  We'll do something. [[06:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24775.04s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, [[06:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24775.84s)]
*  the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[06:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24780.24s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[06:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24784.16s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[06:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24788.72s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[06:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24790.96s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you the way next. [[06:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24793.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24797.36s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[06:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24798.96s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years [[06:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24800.079999999998s)]
*  since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[06:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24802.48s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[06:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24806.48s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[06:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24808.079999999998s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[06:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24809.92s)]
*  We are allies. [[06:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24812.8s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[06:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24813.84s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[06:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24817.2s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[06:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24819.84s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative [[06:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24824.399999999998s)]
*  to make progress towards something [[06:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24827.44s)]
*  that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[06:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24830.16s)]
*  It is a complex picture, [[06:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24833.36s)]
*  but it needs political will and push. [[06:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24834.8s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[06:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24837.44s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team [[06:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24839.36s)]
*  have been open to hear our perspectives. [[06:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24841.2s)]
*  And on trade, we have also emphasized that [[06:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24844.48s)]
*  we can benefit both of us by trading. [[06:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24849.52s)]
*  We can be complementary and we can find good solutions. [[06:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24852.239999999998s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, [[06:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24856.48s)]
*  the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[06:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24858.32s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[06:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24860.399999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[06:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24864.32s)]
*  Any questions? [[06:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24867.44s)]
*  Yes. [[06:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24868.16s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs [[06:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24868.66s)]
*  that you want imposed on Norway? [[06:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24873.84s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the price of your own? [[06:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24875.92s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[06:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24877.359999999997s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[06:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24881.679999999997s)]
*  Do you think that we can get an agreement on that? [[06:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24882.8s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[06:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24884.399999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[06:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24887.12s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit for President Kampenar? [[06:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24891.28s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. [[06:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24893.679999999997s)]
*  I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[06:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24896.239999999998s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, [[06:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24900.399999999998s)]
*  he is receiving us early in the term. [[06:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24902.239999999998s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[06:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24904.0s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[06:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24905.52s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[06:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24906.88s)]
*  Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine [[06:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24914.08s)]
*  since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[06:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24918.08s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today [[06:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24921.36s)]
*  that may have altered your views on things? [[06:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24923.68s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[06:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24927.920000000002s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives. [[06:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24932.72s)]
*  And I want to save a lot of lives. [[06:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24934.56s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war. [[06:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24936.08s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[06:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24939.68s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started [[06:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24940.800000000003s)]
*  because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[06:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24944.56s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[06:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24948.48s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were president. [[06:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24950.08s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this. [[06:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24952.960000000003s)]
*  And it's a shame. [[06:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24957.120000000003s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[06:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24959.760000000002s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[06:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24961.760000000002s)]
*  It's horrible. [[06:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24964.08s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[06:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24965.68s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week, on average. [[06:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24967.28s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[06:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24971.68s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[06:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24972.8s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[06:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24975.44s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal [[06:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24978.0s)]
*  that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[06:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24984.72s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[06:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24988.32s)]
*  I do. [[06:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24989.28s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[06:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24989.76s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[06:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24991.76s)]
*  I hope so. [[06:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24993.6s)]
*  Soon. [[06:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24994.239999999998s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies [[06:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=24994.739999999998s)]
*  in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[06:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25000.8s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[06:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25003.039999999997s)]
*  Greenland is going to be interesting, [[06:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25006.0s)]
*  but that's for another day. [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25007.28s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[06:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25009.12s)]
*  What are you expecting of your allies? [[06:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25011.12s)]
*  And if you don't have that, [[06:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25011.92s)]
*  I think it's a big threat to our world. [[06:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25012.879999999997s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[06:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25015.76s)]
*  Here, please go ahead. [[06:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25018.399999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, [[06:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25019.199999999997s)]
*  you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[06:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25022.24s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, [[06:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25024.88s)]
*  a personal message. [[06:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25027.52s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[06:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25029.2s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[06:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25031.6s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[06:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25032.96s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace [[06:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25034.72s)]
*  and missiles were fired. [[06:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25036.96s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[06:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25039.28s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[06:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25040.8s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's meant. [[06:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25042.16s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions [[06:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25044.24s)]
*  toward Russia or what will you do if President Putin does not? [[06:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25052.08s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[06:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25055.280000000002s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[06:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25057.120000000003s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[06:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25059.04s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[06:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25061.36s)]
*  Things will happen. [[06:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25063.68s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[06:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25064.480000000003s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25067.760000000002s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[06:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25069.120000000003s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25070.0s)]
*  They're dealing. [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25071.84s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[06:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25073.04s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25074.960000000003s)]
*  And you may be telling us that. [[06:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25076.24s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[06:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25077.920000000002s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[06:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25080.4s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, [[06:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25081.6s)]
*  or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25083.2s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[06:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25085.6s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[06:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25088.08s)]
*  He's talking. [[06:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25089.36s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[06:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25090.56s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[06:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25091.920000000002s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[06:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25093.12s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[06:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25094.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[06:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25097.2s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[06:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25099.84s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[06:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25102.64s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, [[06:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25105.52s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, if I may. [[06:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25108.4s)]
*  You've said that the Ukraine have to give some territory [[06:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25109.920000000002s)]
*  to win peace, among them Crimea. [[06:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25116.960000000003s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[06:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25119.52s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today [[06:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25121.04s)]
*  has told you that he does not agree. [[06:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25126.72s)]
*  And he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[06:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25128.800000000003s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[06:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25133.44s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine have to give? [[06:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25135.12s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[06:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25137.76s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[06:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25141.84s)]
*  He's a — he's been a great — he's been a great general, [[06:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25143.52s)]
*  frankly. [[06:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25148.079999999998s)]
*  It was — because that's what you are, really. [[06:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25148.559999999998s)]
*  You're a general. [[06:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25150.239999999998s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[06:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25151.359999999997s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[06:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25153.12s)]
*  Very successful. [[06:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25155.039999999997s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[06:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25156.719999999998s)]
*  He's right here. [[06:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25159.199999999997s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine have to give [[06:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25160.160000000003s)]
*  some territory away to win peace? [[06:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25163.760000000002s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[06:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25166.56s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[06:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25168.160000000003s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[06:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25168.800000000003s)]
*  And we'll get — we'll do the best we can. [[06:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25170.960000000003s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[06:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25173.120000000003s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[06:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25176.0s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president [[06:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25178.08s)]
*  named Barack Hussein Obama. [[06:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25182.160000000003s)]
*  That was — had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[06:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25184.320000000003s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[06:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25186.480000000003s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[06:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25190.320000000003s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[06:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25192.88s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[06:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25194.08s)]
*  There was no anything. [[06:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25195.36s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[06:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25196.160000000003s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[06:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25197.2s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[07:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25200.160000000003s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, [[07:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25203.120000000003s)]
*  not by Donald Trump. [[07:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25206.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[07:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25208.0s)]
*  Mr. President, I had a bomb meeting with the President. [[07:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25208.960000000003s)]
*  The new peace proposal that you've put on the table, [[07:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25211.120000000003s)]
*  it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[07:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25212.24s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine [[07:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25214.160000000003s)]
*  and Russia. [[07:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25217.52s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[07:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25218.48s)]
*  Immediately. [[07:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25222.0s)]
*  Russia has not. [[07:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25223.12s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that? [[07:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25224.239999999998s)]
*  Just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[07:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25228.64s)]
*  I don't think so. [[07:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25231.2s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[07:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25232.079999999998s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[07:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25233.92s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[07:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25235.92s)]
*  Complicated. [[07:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25237.12s)]
*  Very complicated. [[07:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25238.239999999998s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[07:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25239.2s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[07:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25243.2s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners [[07:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25244.8s)]
*  options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[07:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25247.76s)]
*  This war is endable. [[07:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25251.199999999997s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[07:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25252.399999999998s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[07:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25253.84s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[07:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25255.199999999997s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[07:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25256.16s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[07:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25257.199999999997s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[07:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25258.8s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[07:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25260.16s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes [[07:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25261.76s)]
*  should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[07:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25264.079999999998s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles land. [[07:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25266.079999999998s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday [[07:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25267.28s)]
*  that are not alive today because this war continues. [[07:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25270.399999999998s)]
*  And the President wants to stop it. [[07:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25273.12s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the President [[07:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25274.64s)]
*  for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[07:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25276.48s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[07:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25278.399999999998s)]
*  It's not our war. [[07:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25280.239999999998s)]
*  We didn't start it, you know. [[07:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25280.96s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[07:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25282.32s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[07:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25284.079999999998s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[07:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25286.0s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[07:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25288.72s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[07:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25290.88s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[07:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25292.64s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[07:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25294.0s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, [[07:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25296.32s)]
*  and we are nice people, but we're using a lot of pressure on them. [[07:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25299.36s)]
*  What can I say? [[07:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25302.239999999998s)]
*  What can you say, Mr. President, and to your national security team? [[07:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25303.36s)]
*  What concessions has Russia offered up thus far [[07:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25306.32s)]
*  to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[07:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25310.239999999998s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[07:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25313.36s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[07:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25315.28s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[07:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25318.32s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tires, [[07:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25322.48s)]
*  what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[07:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25326.0s)]
*  To buy more? [[07:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25330.96s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[07:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25332.72s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[07:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25334.0s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[07:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25336.48s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[07:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25338.48s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[07:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25340.88s)]
*  We have. We've had a great relationship. [[07:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25343.2s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, [[07:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25345.920000000002s)]
*  but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[07:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25347.68s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25350.0s)]
*  You can't do better. [[07:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25352.24s)]
*  Really? [[07:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25353.12s)]
*  If the U.S. doesn't buy, say, a fight ticket? [[07:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25353.920000000002s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[07:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25356.16s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[07:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25359.36s)]
*  Yes. Yes. [[07:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25360.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[07:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25360.96s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, [[07:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25364.4s)]
*  if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, [[07:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25367.920000000002s)]
*  did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[07:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25370.24s)]
*  Totally. It's totally common ground. [[07:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25373.84s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say [[07:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25376.32s)]
*  he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25379.920000000002s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[07:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25383.76s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[07:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25384.8s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[07:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25387.52s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[07:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25394.88s)]
*  That is clear. That is obvious. It's really happening. [[07:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25398.960000000003s)]
*  Now the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, [[07:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25402.48s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[07:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25406.56s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[07:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25410.0s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[07:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25412.24s)]
*  The lives are being lost. [[07:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25414.399999999998s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[07:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25416.64s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[07:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25420.399999999998s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[07:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25423.199999999997s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[07:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25425.199999999997s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[07:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25428.48s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[07:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25433.039999999997s)]
*  as we do much closer now, [[07:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25436.079999999998s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[07:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25438.399999999998s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[07:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25442.08s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[07:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25444.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[07:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25445.84s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[07:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25449.2s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, [[07:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25451.120000000003s)]
*  and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[07:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25453.52s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[07:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25457.84s)]
*  Mr. President, follow-up question on China. [[07:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25461.2s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[07:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25464.800000000003s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[07:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25469.600000000002s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[07:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25472.08s)]
*  Sorry, it happens. [[07:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25473.920000000002s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[07:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25474.88s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[07:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25476.72s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[07:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25480.24s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[07:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25485.760000000002s)]
*  If the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[07:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25489.760000000002s)]
*  striking a broker piece, [[07:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25494.4s)]
*  does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, [[07:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25495.84s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[07:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25498.960000000003s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[07:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25502.800000000003s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[07:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25503.760000000002s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[07:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25505.52s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[07:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25507.2s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[07:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25509.280000000002s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[07:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25513.120000000003s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, [[07:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25515.52s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[07:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25517.280000000002s)]
*  What does the President... [[07:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25520.24s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country [[07:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25521.2s)]
*  to be officially invited to the White House after the relation thing. [[07:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25524.72s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[07:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25528.72s)]
*  Because I like them. [[07:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25533.36s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, [[07:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25535.68s)]
*  and I like the way your government runs. [[07:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25537.2s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[07:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25540.16s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[07:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25542.640000000003s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[07:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25544.48s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[07:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25545.120000000003s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[07:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25548.16s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[07:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25549.120000000003s)]
*  Absolutely. [[07:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25553.04s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[07:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25553.760000000002s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit Norway. [[07:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25555.440000000002s)]
*  President Trump, first of all, [[07:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25558.320000000003s)]
*  you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[07:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25560.24s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, [[07:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25565.920000000002s)]
*  the way that we have structured our money and what are the... [[07:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25569.280000000002s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s [[07:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25574.16s)]
*  to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[07:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25578.0s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[07:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25582.480000000003s)]
*  dedicated, innovate, and move forward, [[07:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25585.6s)]
*  despite having these incomes, [[07:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25587.92s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history [[07:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25589.76s)]
*  where we can harvest, [[07:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25592.399999999998s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[07:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25593.44s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[07:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25596.079999999998s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[07:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25598.96s)]
*  If we can share experiences, [[07:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25602.719999999998s)]
*  and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[07:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25604.64s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, [[07:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25608.16s)]
*  but there can be techniques and way of working [[07:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25610.96s)]
*  that we have used in organizing our fund. [[07:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25614.16s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister [[07:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25619.28s)]
*  when the first dollar entered that fund, [[07:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25621.36s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a finance minister today. [[07:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25624.32s)]
*  What do you say? [[07:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25627.52s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[07:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25628.48s)]
*  we are ready to sit down with the U.S. [[07:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25630.72s)]
*  to also work with them on if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, [[07:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25633.12s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[07:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25637.12s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States [[07:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25639.76s)]
*  is that half the fund, close to one trillion U.S. dollars, [[07:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25643.92s)]
*  are invested in the United States, [[07:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25649.12s)]
*  mainly in equity, but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[07:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25652.079999999998s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, [[07:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25656.399999999998s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[07:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25661.28s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[07:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25664.399999999998s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[07:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25667.28s)]
*  the path forward to peace. [[07:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25670.239999999998s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, [[07:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25672.24s)]
*  we commend the U.S. for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[07:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25673.84s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[07:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25678.56s)]
*  And therefore, I'm proud that [[07:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25681.92s)]
*  Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[07:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25684.0s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[07:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25687.76s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[07:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25693.36s)]
*  I may add to that, you know, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[07:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25696.079999999998s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[07:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25699.76s)]
*  The best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves. [[07:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25703.84s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[07:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25708.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[07:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25709.199999999997s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April the 2nd, [[07:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25713.6s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[07:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25717.36s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the prime minister, [[07:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25721.52s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[07:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25725.68s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[07:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25731.6s)]
*  It's a big fund and they don't have any debt. [[07:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25735.44s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[07:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25739.199999999997s)]
*  Are you talking about the agreement of which country? [[07:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25742.239999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, 2018, your former secretary of state Mike Pompeo [[07:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25745.28s)]
*  called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[07:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25748.8s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration [[07:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25752.239999999998s)]
*  changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[07:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25755.28s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[07:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25759.039999999997s)]
*  It would have never started if I were president. [[07:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25760.16s)]
*  This is a war that is a horrible, horrible. [[07:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25762.239999999998s)]
*  All wars are horrible. [[07:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25765.52s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[07:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25766.48s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this [[07:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25769.039999999997s)]
*  because so many lives have been lost. [[07:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25773.199999999997s)]
*  Not only soldiers, a lot of lives have been lost. [[07:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25776.16s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[07:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25780.0s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[07:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25784.56s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to. [[07:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25786.960000000003s)]
*  And it didn't. [[07:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25788.24s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[07:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25789.120000000003s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[07:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25790.56s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[07:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25791.760000000002s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[07:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25793.280000000002s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[07:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25794.640000000003s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[07:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25795.84s)]
*  But we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[07:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25798.800000000003s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[07:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25802.72s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[07:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25806.640000000003s)]
*  And you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago, [[07:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25809.120000000003s)]
*  under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, [[07:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25813.12s)]
*  unfortunately, for this country. [[07:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25818.559999999998s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[07:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25820.399999999998s)]
*  And that was a big thing. [[07:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25827.36s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[07:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25829.039999999997s)]
*  But this isn't my war. [[07:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25830.96s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[07:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25832.96s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[07:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25834.239999999998s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[07:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25839.920000000002s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[07:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25843.2s)]
*  Otherwise, and the prime minister had a statement. [[07:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25845.28s)]
*  He said, this is just a point in time. [[07:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25847.920000000002s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[07:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25850.72s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[07:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25852.48s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[07:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25863.68s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[07:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25864.56s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[07:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25867.04s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident that we're going to know pretty soon. [[07:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25868.88s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[07:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25872.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[07:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25878.64s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[07:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25879.44s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[07:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25882.16s)]
*  That would be nice. [[07:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25884.4s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[07:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25885.12s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[07:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25886.48s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[07:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25889.68s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[07:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25891.76s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[07:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25895.76s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[07:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25898.0s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[07:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25903.76s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week [[07:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25907.28s)]
*  as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[07:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25911.84s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. [[07:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25915.679999999997s)]
*  They came with their A game. [[07:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25918.399999999998s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[07:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25920.0s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you match it with the [[07:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25923.2s)]
*  Great East? [[07:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25930.4s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[07:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25932.4s)]
*  If you match the Great East? [[07:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25934.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[07:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25936.4s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25938.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[07:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25942.4s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[07:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25946.4s)]
*  You know, we have four and Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[07:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25948.4s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. [[07:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25950.4s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[07:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25952.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[07:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25954.4s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[07:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25956.4s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[07:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25960.4s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[07:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25962.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[07:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25966.4s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them [[07:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25968.4s)]
*  than President Trump is right now. [[07:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25972.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[07:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25974.4s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[07:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25976.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[07:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25978.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace [[07:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25982.4s)]
*  and establish peace and protect peace. [[07:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25988.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[07:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25990.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second. [[07:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=25992.4s)]
*  And we couldn't, Mr. Prime Minister. [[07:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26000.4s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[07:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26002.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran. [[07:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26006.4s)]
*  And we're having very serious meetings. [[07:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26010.4s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[07:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26014.4s)]
*  And one option is not a good option. [[07:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26016.4s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[07:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26018.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[07:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26022.4s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[07:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26028.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[07:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26030.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision. [[07:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26034.4s)]
*  And a lot of lives will be saved. [[07:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26036.4s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, [[07:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26038.4s)]
*  the slowest pace since 2009. [[07:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26046.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[07:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26048.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[07:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26050.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[07:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26054.4s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[07:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26058.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates. [[07:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26062.4s)]
*  Because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[07:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26064.4s)]
*  I did. [[07:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26069.4s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[07:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26070.4s)]
*  It's way down. [[07:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26074.4s)]
*  Energy is down. [[07:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26075.4s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[07:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26076.4s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[07:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26079.4s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[07:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26083.4s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[07:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26085.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[07:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26093.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[07:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26095.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[07:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26100.4s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[07:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26102.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[07:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26107.4s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[07:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26108.4s)]
*  And they happened. [[07:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26109.4s)]
*  They went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[07:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26110.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[07:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26113.4s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[07:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26117.4s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[07:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26119.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[07:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26122.4s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[07:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26124.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[07:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26126.4s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[07:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26128.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[07:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26129.4s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[07:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26130.4s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[07:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26131.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country. [[07:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26135.4s)]
*  We have a very strong country. [[07:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26137.4s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[07:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26139.4s)]
*  I think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[07:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26141.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[07:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26144.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — it would be physically impossible. [[07:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26149.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[07:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26154.4s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[07:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26159.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[07:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26165.4s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[07:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26167.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[07:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26169.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[07:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26171.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[07:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26173.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[07:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26180.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[07:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26185.4s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[07:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26187.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[07:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26189.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military. [[07:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26192.4s)]
*  And then they don't get treated fairly on trade. [[07:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26197.4s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[07:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26200.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26203.4s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[07:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26206.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[07:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26210.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[07:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26215.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[07:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26219.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[07:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26223.4s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[07:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26227.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[07:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26231.4s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[07:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26232.4s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[07:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26234.4s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[07:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26239.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[07:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26241.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[07:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26243.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[07:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26247.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[07:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26249.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[07:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26253.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other President. [[07:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26255.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[07:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26258.4s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[07:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26261.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[07:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26265.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[07:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26267.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26269.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26271.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26273.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[07:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26279.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[07:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26285.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[07:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26290.4s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[07:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26298.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[07:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26300.4s)]
*  And every respect to war is very important. [[07:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26303.4s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week dying — young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[07:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26306.4s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[07:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26316.4s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[07:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26320.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[07:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26322.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[07:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26324.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[07:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26326.4s)]
*  We're going to have a lot of good news that's taking place right now. [[07:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26329.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[07:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26332.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[07:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26340.4s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[07:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26342.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[07:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26349.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[07:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26354.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[07:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26356.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us. [[07:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26358.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26362.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[07:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26364.4s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[07:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26365.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[07:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26371.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[07:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26373.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[07:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26375.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[07:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26377.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[07:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26379.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[07:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26382.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[07:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26385.4s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[07:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26389.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[07:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26398.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[07:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26402.4s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[07:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26404.4s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[07:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26411.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[07:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26417.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[07:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26419.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[07:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26421.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[07:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26429.4s)]
*  Any questions? [[07:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26431.4s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[07:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26434.4s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[07:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26441.4s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[07:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26443.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[07:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26446.4s)]
*  Do you think that we can get an agreement with Norway? [[07:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26448.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[07:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26450.4s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss the possible visit to Norway? [[07:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26452.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss the possible visit to President Trump? [[07:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26456.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. [[07:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26458.4s)]
*  I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[07:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26460.4s)]
*  I told the President that he is receiving us early in the term. [[07:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26464.4s)]
*  He is welcome to visit Norway. [[07:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26468.4s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[07:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26470.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[07:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26472.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[07:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26476.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[07:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26486.4s)]
*  I don't know what happened if I were President, but Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[07:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26516.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[07:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26525.4s)]
*  And then I looked at it, and I see the results. [[07:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26527.4s)]
*  It's horrible. [[07:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26529.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[07:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26531.4s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[07:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26533.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[07:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26537.4s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons, but I would say that is my number one reason. [[07:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26538.4s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe will accept? [[07:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26544.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. I do. [[07:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26553.4s)]
*  I believe they will accept, and I think we're going to get this over with. [[07:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26555.4s)]
*  I hope so. Soon. [[07:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26558.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[07:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26560.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[07:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26568.4s)]
*  Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[07:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26571.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[07:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26574.4s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[07:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26576.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[07:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26577.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[07:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26581.4s)]
*  Here, please, go ahead. [[07:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26583.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Social post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[07:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26584.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[07:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26590.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[07:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26594.4s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[07:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26596.4s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[07:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26598.4s)]
*  We were in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[07:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26600.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[07:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26604.4s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[07:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26606.4s)]
*  And that's what it's been. [[07:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26607.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[07:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26610.4s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia, or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[07:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26612.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[07:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26621.4s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[07:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26622.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[07:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26624.4s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[07:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26626.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[07:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26628.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[07:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26630.4s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[07:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26633.4s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[07:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26635.4s)]
*  They're dealing. [[07:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26637.4s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[07:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26638.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[07:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26640.4s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[07:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26642.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[07:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26643.4s)]
*  And Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know. [[07:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26645.4s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[07:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26648.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[07:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26650.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[07:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26653.4s)]
*  He's talking, and we're putting a lot of pressure. [[07:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26654.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[07:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26657.4s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[07:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26658.4s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[07:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26660.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[07:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26662.4s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[07:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26665.4s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[07:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26667.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, [[07:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26670.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, if I may. [[07:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26673.4s)]
*  You've said that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[07:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26675.4s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. [[07:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26683.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[07:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26684.4s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you [[07:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26686.4s)]
*  that he does not agree, and he believes in the territorial integrity of Ukraine. [[07:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26692.4s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[07:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26698.4s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give? [[07:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26700.4s)]
*  Well, the former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[07:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26702.4s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[07:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26706.4s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[07:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26708.4s)]
*  Because that's what you are, really. [[07:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26713.4s)]
*  You're a general. [[07:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26715.4s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[07:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26716.4s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[07:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26718.4s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[07:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26721.4s)]
*  He's right here. [[07:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26724.4s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[07:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26725.4s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[07:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26731.4s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[07:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26733.4s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[07:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26734.4s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[07:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26736.4s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[07:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26738.4s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[07:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26741.4s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[07:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26743.4s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[07:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26749.4s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[07:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26751.4s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[07:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26755.4s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[07:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26758.4s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[07:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26759.4s)]
*  There was no anything. [[07:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26760.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[07:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26761.4s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[07:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26762.4s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[07:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26765.4s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[07:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26768.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[07:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26773.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I haven't long been meeting this president. [[07:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26774.4s)]
*  The peace proposal that you put on the table, it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[07:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26776.4s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[07:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26779.4s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[07:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26783.4s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[07:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26787.4s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that? [[07:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26789.4s)]
*  Just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[07:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26793.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[07:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26796.4s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[07:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26797.4s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[07:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26799.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[07:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26801.4s)]
*  Complicated. [[07:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26802.4s)]
*  Very complicated. [[07:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26803.4s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[07:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26804.4s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[07:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26808.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[07:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26810.4s)]
*  This war is endable. [[07:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26816.4s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[07:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26817.4s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[07:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26819.4s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[07:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26820.4s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[07:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26821.4s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[07:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26822.4s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[07:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26824.4s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[07:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26825.4s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[07:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26826.4s)]
*  It's horrible those missiles landed. [[07:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26831.4s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[07:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26832.4s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[07:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26839.4s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[07:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26843.4s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[07:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26844.4s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[07:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26847.4s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[07:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26849.4s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[07:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26850.4s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[07:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26853.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[07:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26855.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[07:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26857.4s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[07:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26858.4s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[07:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26860.4s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[07:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26865.4s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[07:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26867.4s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[07:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26877.4s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[07:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26879.4s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[07:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26882.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[07:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26884.4s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[07:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26886.4s)]
*  To buy more? [[07:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26895.4s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[07:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26897.4s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[07:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26899.4s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[07:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26901.4s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[07:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26903.4s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[07:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26905.4s)]
*  We have — we've had a great relationship. [[07:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26908.4s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[07:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26911.4s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[07:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26915.4s)]
*  You can't do better. [[07:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26917.4s)]
*  Really? [[07:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26919.4s)]
*  If they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[07:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26921.4s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[07:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26924.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26926.4s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[07:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26929.4s)]
*  Totally. It's totally common ground. [[07:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26939.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[07:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26941.4s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. He's going to help us end it. [[07:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26949.4s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[07:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26952.4s)]
*  That is clear. That is obvious. It's really happening. [[07:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26964.4s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[07:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26967.4s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. They are defending themselves. Lives are being lost. [[07:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26974.4s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[07:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26981.4s)]
*  It needs to be respected. And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[07:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26988.4s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[07:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26993.4s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, [[07:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=26998.4s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[07:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27002.4s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today, and then we have to move on. [[07:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27007.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[07:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27011.4s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives, but it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[07:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27014.4s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[07:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27022.4s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[07:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27026.4s)]
*  Mr. President, if... I forgot my question. [[07:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27029.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[07:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27035.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[07:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27038.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes. No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[07:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27039.4s)]
*  Oh, well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more hatred missiles. [[07:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27044.4s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[07:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27050.4s)]
*  If you and the United States decide to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, [[07:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27054.4s)]
*  does that also mean a no on hatred missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[07:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27060.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. I think we're going to make a deal. [[07:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27067.4s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. We won't have to worry about your question. [[07:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27070.4s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[07:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27074.4s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[07:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27078.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[07:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27080.4s)]
*  You said once the President... [[07:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27085.4s)]
*  If the President... [[07:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27086.4s)]
*  Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the relation day. [[07:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27087.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[07:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27094.4s)]
*  Because I like them. [[07:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27098.4s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[07:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27100.4s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[07:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27105.4s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. It's a great thing. Not an easy thing to do. [[07:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27107.4s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[07:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27112.4s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[07:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27114.4s)]
*  Absolutely. You gave me that invitation. [[07:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27117.4s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[07:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27120.4s)]
*  President Trump, the White House, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[07:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27123.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been enough for the discussion today, the way that we have structured our funding and what are the... [[07:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27130.4s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from our oil and gas. [[07:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27138.4s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate, and move forward despite having these incomes, [[07:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27147.4s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, and we have transferred that into investments, [[07:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27154.4s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[07:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27160.4s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[07:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27163.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., you never copy this one-to-one, [[07:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27167.4s)]
*  but there can be techniques and a way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[07:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27175.4s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[07:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27182.4s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say, Jens? [[07:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27188.4s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[07:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27193.4s)]
*  if they want to establish a wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[07:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27199.4s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[07:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27204.4s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[07:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27210.4s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[07:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27217.4s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the wealth fund. [[07:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27221.4s)]
*  Then just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[07:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27228.4s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[07:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27235.4s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[07:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27241.4s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[07:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27247.4s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[07:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27253.4s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[07:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27258.4s)]
*  If I may add to that, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[07:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27261.4s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[07:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27264.4s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[07:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27268.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[07:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27274.4s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[07:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27282.4s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[07:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27290.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[07:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27295.4s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[07:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27303.4s)]
*  Aren't it today that you're saying agreement of which country? [[07:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27307.4s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[07:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27310.4s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions with Crimea? [[07:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27317.4s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[07:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27323.4s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible, horrible. All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad, [[07:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27327.4s)]
*  and I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[07:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27333.4s)]
*  Not only soldiers, a lot of lives have been lost. [[07:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27340.4s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[07:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27344.4s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen, and it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[07:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27351.4s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. I would talk to Putin about it. [[07:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27355.4s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, [[07:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27359.4s)]
*  but we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in, [[07:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27363.4s)]
*  and I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did, and it was only when I got out. [[07:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27367.4s)]
*  And you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[07:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27373.4s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, [[07:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27379.4s)]
*  what happened is large chunks of lead were given up, and it was called Crimea, [[07:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27384.4s)]
*  and that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[07:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27391.4s)]
*  But this isn't my war. This is Biden's war. [[07:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27395.4s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened, [[07:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27399.4s)]
*  but I'm trying to put out the fire, and I think we'll be successful, [[07:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27404.4s)]
*  and if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. Otherwise, and the Prime Minister had a statement. [[07:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27408.4s)]
*  He said, this is just a point in time. We're very lucky because this is a point, [[07:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27413.4s)]
*  and if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[07:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27417.4s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome, sir? [[07:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27421.4s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. [[07:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27428.4s)]
*  I think he wants to end it, and I feel pretty confident of that, but we're going to know pretty soon. [[07:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27432.4s)]
*  Do you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[07:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27441.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[07:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27443.4s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[07:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27444.4s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. [[07:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27447.4s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them, but we have many of them there, [[07:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27450.4s)]
*  and they all want to meet, and they want to meet about trade. [[07:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27453.4s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[07:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27456.4s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[07:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27460.4s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[07:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27463.4s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought, [[07:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27468.4s)]
*  and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week, [[07:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27472.4s)]
*  as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[07:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27476.4s)]
*  So South Koreans came early, they came with their A game, [[07:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27480.4s)]
*  and we will see if they follow through on that. [[07:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27484.4s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you match your creations? [[07:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27487.4s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[07:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27494.4s)]
*  If you match your creations. [[07:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27496.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[07:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27497.4s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[07:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27499.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[07:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27504.4s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[07:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27507.4s)]
*  You know we have four, and Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[07:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27509.4s)]
*  It's the same four. [[07:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27513.4s)]
*  But they're great countries, and they were brave doing it, and it's worked out very well. [[07:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27515.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[07:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27519.4s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[07:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27522.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[07:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27525.4s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[07:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27526.4s)]
*  There's a great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[07:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27528.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[07:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27531.4s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them [[07:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27533.4s)]
*  than President Trump is right now. [[07:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27537.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[07:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27539.4s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[07:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27541.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[07:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27543.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president [[07:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27547.4s)]
*  who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[07:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27552.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[07:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27555.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[07:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27558.4s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second, [[07:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27560.4s)]
*  if we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[07:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27565.4s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[07:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27567.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran, and we're having very serious meetings. [[07:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27571.4s)]
*  And there are only two options, and one option is not a good option. [[07:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27578.4s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[07:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27584.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran, [[07:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27587.4s)]
*  but that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[07:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27592.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[07:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27595.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision, and a lot of lives will be saved. [[07:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27599.4s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March. [[07:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27604.4s)]
*  The slowest pace since 2009. [[07:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27612.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[07:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27615.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[07:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27617.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[07:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27620.4s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[07:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27624.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, [[07:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27627.4s)]
*  oh, I said I was going to get prices down. I did. [[07:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27632.4s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. It's way down. [[07:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27635.4s)]
*  Energy is down, and we're about $64 a barrel. [[07:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27640.4s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[07:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27644.4s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[07:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27648.4s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[07:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27650.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[07:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27658.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[07:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27660.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[07:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27665.4s)]
*  I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[07:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27667.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. Tell me about eggs. [[07:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27672.4s)]
*  And they happened. They went through the roof, and you couldn't get them. [[07:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27674.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[07:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27678.4s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs, and the price was down 87 percent. [[07:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27682.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[07:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27687.4s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[07:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27689.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. That's the Fed. [[07:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27691.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[07:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27694.4s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[07:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27695.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country. [[07:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27699.4s)]
*  We have a very strong country, and we have every other country. [[07:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27702.4s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[07:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27705.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[07:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27709.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these. [[07:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27714.4s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. [[07:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27717.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[07:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27719.4s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[07:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27724.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[07:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27729.4s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[07:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27732.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[07:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27734.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[07:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27736.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[07:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27738.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[07:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27745.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[07:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27750.4s)]
*  And militaries is another subject we talk about. [[07:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27752.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[07:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27754.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military. [[07:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27757.4s)]
*  And then they don't get treated fairly on trade. [[07:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27762.4s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[07:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27765.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[07:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27767.4s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[07:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27771.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[07:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27775.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[07:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27780.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[07:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27784.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[07:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27788.4s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[07:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27792.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[07:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27796.4s)]
*  I mean, we were abused by countries. [[07:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27797.4s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[07:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27799.4s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[07:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27804.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[07:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27806.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country in my first term. [[07:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27808.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[07:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27812.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[07:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27814.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[07:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27818.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other President. [[07:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27820.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[07:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27823.4s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[07:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27826.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[07:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27830.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[07:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27832.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27835.4s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[07:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27836.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27837.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27843.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[07:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27844.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[07:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27851.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[07:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27856.4s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[07:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27863.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[07:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27865.4s)]
*  And every respect to war is very important. [[07:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27868.4s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week dying — young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[07:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27871.4s)]
*  And we want to — we want to end that war. [[07:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27881.4s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[07:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27885.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[07:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27887.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[07:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27889.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[07:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27891.4s)]
*  And meetings are taking place right now. [[07:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27894.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[07:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27896.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[07:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27905.4s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[07:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27906.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[07:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27914.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[07:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27919.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[07:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27921.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us. [[07:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27923.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27927.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[07:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27929.4s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[07:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27930.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[07:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27936.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[07:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27938.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[07:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27940.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[07:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27943.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[07:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27944.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[07:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27947.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[07:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27950.4s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[07:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27954.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[07:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27963.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[07:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27967.4s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[07:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27969.4s)]
*  And we have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[07:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27976.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[07:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27982.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[07:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27984.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[07:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27986.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27994.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[07:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27996.4s)]
*  Any questions, please? [[07:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27997.4s)]
*  I want to ask you the first, Mr. President. [[07:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=27999.4s)]
*  Have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[07:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28001.4s)]
*  Is there a chance that you could lower the tariffs? [[07:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28006.4s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[07:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28008.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[07:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28012.4s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[07:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28014.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[07:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28016.4s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[07:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28018.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit for President Trump to Norway? [[07:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28021.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[07:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28024.4s)]
*  I love it. [[07:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28026.4s)]
*  And it is a beautiful place. [[07:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28027.4s)]
*  They have. [[07:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28029.4s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[07:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28030.4s)]
*  He is welcome to visit Norway. [[07:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28034.4s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[07:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28035.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[07:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28037.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[07:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28041.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[07:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28051.4s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[07:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28058.4s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives. [[07:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28063.4s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war. [[07:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28066.4s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[07:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28070.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[07:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28071.4s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[07:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28079.4s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[07:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28080.4s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[07:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28082.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[07:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28089.4s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. [[07:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28091.4s)]
*  It's horrible. [[07:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28094.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[07:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28095.4s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28097.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[07:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28100.4s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[07:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28102.4s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[07:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28105.4s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[07:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28108.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[07:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28118.4s)]
*  I do. [[07:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28119.4s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[07:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28120.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[07:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28121.4s)]
*  I hope so. [[07:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28123.4s)]
*  Soon. [[07:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28124.4s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[07:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28125.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[07:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28133.4s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting. [[07:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28136.4s)]
*  But that's for another day. [[07:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28137.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[07:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28139.4s)]
*  What are you expecting on your ally? [[07:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28141.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[07:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28142.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[07:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28146.4s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[07:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28148.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Soap Post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[07:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28149.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[07:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28155.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin at this point? [[07:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28159.4s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[07:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28162.4s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[07:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28163.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[07:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28165.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[07:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28169.4s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[07:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28171.4s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's going to be. [[07:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28172.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm glad that the bombs keep falling. [[07:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28175.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[07:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28177.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[07:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28178.4s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[07:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28179.4s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[07:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28183.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[07:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28186.4s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[07:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28187.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now. [[07:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28189.4s)]
*  But I won't be happy. [[07:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28190.4s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[07:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28191.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[07:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28193.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[07:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28195.4s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[07:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28198.4s)]
*  I'm putting a lot of pressure. [[07:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28200.4s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[07:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28201.4s)]
*  They're dealing. [[07:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28202.4s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[07:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28203.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[07:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28205.4s)]
*  And you may be telling us that. [[07:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28206.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[07:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28208.4s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[07:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28210.4s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[07:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28212.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[07:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28215.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[07:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28218.4s)]
*  He's talking. [[07:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28219.4s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[07:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28220.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[07:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28222.4s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[07:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28223.4s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[07:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28224.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[07:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28227.4s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[07:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28230.4s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[07:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28232.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister, [[07:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28235.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, if I may. [[07:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28238.4s)]
*  You've said that it's, that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[07:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28240.4s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. [[07:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28248.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[07:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28249.4s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree [[07:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28250.4s)]
*  and he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[07:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28258.4s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[07:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28263.4s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine has to give Ukraine that? [[07:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28265.4s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[07:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28267.4s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[07:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28271.4s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[07:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28273.4s)]
*  Because that's what you are, really. [[07:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28278.4s)]
*  You're a general. [[07:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28279.4s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[07:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28280.4s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[07:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28282.4s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[07:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28285.4s)]
*  He's right here. [[07:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28288.4s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace? [[07:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28289.4s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[07:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28295.4s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[07:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28297.4s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[07:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28298.4s)]
*  And we'll get, we'll do the best we can. [[07:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28300.4s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[07:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28302.4s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[07:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28305.4s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[07:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28307.4s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[07:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28313.4s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[07:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28315.4s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[07:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28319.4s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[07:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28322.4s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[07:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28323.4s)]
*  There was no anything. [[07:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28324.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[07:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28325.4s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[07:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28326.4s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[07:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28329.4s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was President, not by Donald Trump. [[07:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28333.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[07:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28338.4s)]
*  Mr. President, the U.S. peace proposal that you put on the table, [[07:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28339.4s)]
*  it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[07:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28342.4s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[07:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28344.4s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[07:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28348.4s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[07:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28352.4s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, [[07:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28354.4s)]
*  just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[07:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28358.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[07:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28361.4s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[07:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28362.4s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[07:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28364.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[07:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28366.4s)]
*  Complicated. [[07:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28367.4s)]
*  Very complicated. [[07:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28368.4s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[07:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28369.4s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[07:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28373.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss [[07:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28375.4s)]
*  about things that it would take to end a war. [[07:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28379.4s)]
*  This war is endable. [[07:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28381.4s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[07:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28382.4s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[07:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28384.4s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[07:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28385.4s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[07:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28386.4s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[07:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28387.4s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[07:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28389.4s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[07:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28390.4s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody [[07:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28391.4s)]
*  of why this war needs to end. [[07:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28395.4s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[07:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28396.4s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday [[07:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28397.4s)]
*  that are not alive today because this war continues. [[07:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28400.4s)]
*  And the president wants to stop it. [[07:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28403.4s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker [[07:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28404.4s)]
*  and trying to save lives. [[07:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28407.4s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[07:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28408.4s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[07:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28410.4s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[07:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28412.4s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[07:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28414.4s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[07:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28416.4s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[07:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28418.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[07:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28420.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[07:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28422.4s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[07:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28423.4s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, [[07:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28425.4s)]
*  then we are nice people. [[07:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28428.4s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[07:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28429.4s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, [[07:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28431.4s)]
*  what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point [[07:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28435.4s)]
*  where you're closer to peace? [[07:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28440.4s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[07:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28442.4s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[07:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28445.4s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[07:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28447.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[07:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28449.4s)]
*  If you are going to take down the terrorists, [[07:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28451.4s)]
*  what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[07:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28456.4s)]
*  To buy more? [[07:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28460.4s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[07:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28462.4s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[07:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28464.4s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[07:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28466.4s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[07:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28468.4s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[07:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28470.4s)]
*  We have had a great relationship. [[07:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28473.4s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[07:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28475.4s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[07:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28477.4s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[07:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28480.4s)]
*  You can't do better. [[07:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28482.4s)]
*  Really? [[07:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28484.4s)]
*  If they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[07:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28486.4s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[07:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28489.4s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[07:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28490.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[07:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28491.4s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[07:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28494.4s)]
*  But on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, [[07:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28497.4s)]
*  did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[07:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28500.4s)]
*  Totally. [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28504.4s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[07:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28505.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say [[07:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28506.4s)]
*  he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[07:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28510.4s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[07:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28514.4s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[07:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28516.4s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[07:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28518.4s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[07:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28525.4s)]
*  That is clear. [[07:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28529.4s)]
*  That is obvious. [[07:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28530.4s)]
*  It's really happening. [[07:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28531.4s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, [[07:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28532.4s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[07:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28536.4s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[07:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28539.4s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[07:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28541.4s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[07:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28543.4s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[07:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28545.4s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[07:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28550.4s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[07:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28553.4s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[07:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28555.4s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[07:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28558.4s)]
*  And here, I believe Europeans and Americans working together, [[07:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28563.4s)]
*  as we do much closer now, [[07:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28566.4s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[07:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28568.4s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[07:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28572.4s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[07:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28574.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[07:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28576.4s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[07:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28579.4s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world [[07:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28581.4s)]
*  to have such a broad conflict going on. [[07:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28585.4s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[07:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28588.4s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[07:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28591.4s)]
*  Mr. President, if... [[07:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28595.4s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[07:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28599.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[07:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28601.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[07:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28603.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[07:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28605.4s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[07:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28607.4s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[07:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28610.4s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[07:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28615.4s)]
*  If you and the United States decide to pull out of negotiating for peace, [[07:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28619.4s)]
*  trying to broker peace, [[07:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28624.4s)]
*  does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, [[07:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28626.4s)]
*  a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[07:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28629.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[07:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28632.4s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[07:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28634.4s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that will be wonderful. [[07:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28636.4s)]
*  I'm sorry about your question. [[07:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28638.4s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[07:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28640.4s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[07:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28643.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, [[07:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28646.4s)]
*  and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[07:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28648.4s)]
*  You said once the President... [[07:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28651.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House [[07:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28653.4s)]
*  after the liberation day. [[07:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28658.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[07:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28660.4s)]
*  Because I like them. [[07:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28664.4s)]
*  I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[07:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28666.4s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[07:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28670.4s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[07:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28672.4s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[07:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28674.4s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[07:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28675.4s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[07:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28677.4s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[07:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28679.4s)]
*  Absolutely. You gave me that invitation. [[07:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28682.4s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[07:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28685.4s)]
*  President Trump, first of all, [[07:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28688.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you said before that you like the Norwegian petroleum fund. [[07:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28690.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, [[07:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28696.4s)]
*  the way that we have structured our economy and whatever it is. [[07:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28699.4s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s [[07:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28704.4s)]
*  to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[07:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28708.4s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, [[07:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28712.4s)]
*  dedicate it, innovate, and move forward, [[07:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28715.4s)]
*  despite having these incomes, [[07:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28718.4s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[07:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28720.4s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, [[07:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28724.4s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[07:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28726.4s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[07:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28729.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28733.4s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, [[07:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28738.4s)]
*  but there can be techniques and a way of working [[07:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28741.4s)]
*  that we have used in organizing our fund. [[07:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28744.4s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[07:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28749.4s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a finance minister today. [[07:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28754.4s)]
*  What do you say, Jens? [[07:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28757.4s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[07:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28759.4s)]
*  we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[07:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28761.4s)]
*  if they want to establish a sort of wealth fund, [[07:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28765.4s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[07:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28767.4s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States [[07:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28770.4s)]
*  is that half the fund, close to one trillion U.S. dollars, [[07:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28774.4s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[07:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28779.4s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[07:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28783.4s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, [[07:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28787.4s)]
*  expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[07:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28791.4s)]
*  Then just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, [[07:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28794.4s)]
*  we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[07:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28797.4s)]
*  the path forward to peace. [[08:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28800.4s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, [[08:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28802.4s)]
*  we commend the U.S. for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[08:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28804.4s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine. [[08:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28808.4s)]
*  And therefore, I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[08:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28812.4s)]
*  And this year, we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[08:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28818.4s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[08:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28823.4s)]
*  If I may add to that, if there is a peace and there will be a peace, [[08:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28826.4s)]
*  we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[08:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28830.4s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves. [[08:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28834.4s)]
*  And we are investing in that. [[08:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28838.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, [[08:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28840.4s)]
*  when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2, the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[08:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28844.4s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[08:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28851.4s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[08:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28855.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of $2 trillion. [[08:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28861.4s)]
*  It's a big fund. [[08:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28865.4s)]
*  And they don't have any debt. [[08:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28866.4s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[08:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28869.4s)]
*  Are there any agreements of which countries? [[08:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28872.4s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[08:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28875.4s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[08:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28882.4s)]
*  Well, the war started. [[08:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28888.4s)]
*  It would have never started if I were president. [[08:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28890.4s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible. [[08:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28892.4s)]
*  Horrible. All wars are horrible. [[08:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28894.4s)]
*  This one is in particular bad. [[08:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28896.4s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[08:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28898.4s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[08:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28906.4s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[08:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28909.4s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. [[08:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28914.4s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. [[08:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28916.4s)]
*  And it didn't. [[08:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28918.4s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? [[08:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28919.4s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. [[08:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28920.4s)]
*  We never even discussed it. [[08:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28921.4s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. [[08:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28923.4s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[08:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28924.4s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[08:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28926.4s)]
*  But we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[08:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28928.4s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[08:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28932.4s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. [[08:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28936.4s)]
*  And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately for this country, what happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[08:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28938.4s)]
*  And that was a big thing. [[08:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28956.4s)]
*  That was a big moment. [[08:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28958.4s)]
*  But this isn't my war. [[08:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28960.4s)]
*  This is Biden's war. [[08:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28962.4s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[08:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28963.4s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[08:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28969.4s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives. [[08:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28972.4s)]
*  Otherwise, and the prime minister had a statement. [[08:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28974.4s)]
*  He said, This is just a point in time. [[08:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28977.4s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[08:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28980.4s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[08:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28982.4s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have a meeting with other world leaders? [[08:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28985.4s)]
*  I don't think he will. [[08:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28989.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make peace. [[08:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28994.4s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[08:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28997.4s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. [[08:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=28999.4s)]
*  But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[08:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29000.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[08:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29002.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[08:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29008.4s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[08:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29009.4s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[08:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29012.4s)]
*  That would be nice. [[08:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29014.4s)]
*  I'd like to take care of all of them. [[08:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29015.4s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[08:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29016.4s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[08:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29019.4s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads in great deals. [[08:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29021.4s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[08:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29025.4s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the public of South Korea today. [[08:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29027.4s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[08:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29032.4s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[08:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29036.4s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. [[08:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29045.4s)]
*  They came with their A game. [[08:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29048.4s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[08:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29050.4s)]
*  Prime Minister, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you match your agreement with the K-8? [[08:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29053.4s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[08:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29060.4s)]
*  If you match your agreement with the K-8, what do you think? [[08:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29061.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[08:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29062.4s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[08:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29064.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[08:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29069.4s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[08:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29072.4s)]
*  You know we have four. [[08:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29075.4s)]
*  And Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[08:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29076.4s)]
*  It's the same four. [[08:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29079.4s)]
*  But they're great countries, and they were brave doing it. [[08:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29081.4s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[08:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29083.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[08:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29085.4s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[08:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29087.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[08:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29091.4s)]
*  Could you say something about that? [[08:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29092.4s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[08:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29093.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[08:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29097.4s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[08:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29098.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[08:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29104.4s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[08:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29106.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[08:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29108.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a President who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[08:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29112.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[08:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29120.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[08:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29123.4s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second, if we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[08:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29125.4s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[08:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29132.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran, and we're having very serious meetings. [[08:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29137.4s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[08:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29145.4s)]
*  And the one option is not a good option. [[08:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29147.4s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[08:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29149.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[08:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29153.4s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[08:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29158.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[08:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29161.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[08:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29164.4s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[08:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29169.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[08:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29180.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[08:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29182.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[08:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29185.4s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[08:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29189.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[08:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29192.4s)]
*  I did. Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[08:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29200.4s)]
*  It's way down. [[08:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29204.4s)]
*  Energy is down. [[08:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29205.4s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[08:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29206.4s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[08:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29209.4s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[08:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29213.4s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[08:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29215.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[08:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29223.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[08:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29225.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[08:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29230.4s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[08:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29232.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[08:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29237.4s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[08:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29238.4s)]
*  And they have been. [[08:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29239.4s)]
*  They were — they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[08:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29240.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House — thousands and thousands of eggs. [[08:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29243.4s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[08:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29249.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[08:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29252.4s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[08:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29254.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[08:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29256.4s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[08:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29258.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[08:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29259.4s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[08:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29260.4s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[08:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29261.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country, and we have every other country — [[08:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29265.4s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[08:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29271.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[08:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29275.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — it would be physically impossible. [[08:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29280.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[08:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29285.4s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[08:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29290.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[08:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29295.4s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[08:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29298.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[08:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29300.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[08:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29302.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[08:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29304.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[08:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29311.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[08:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29316.4s)]
*  The military is another subject we talk about. [[08:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29318.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[08:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29320.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do, where we virtually take care of their military, [[08:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29323.4s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[08:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29328.4s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[08:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29330.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you, [[08:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29333.4s)]
*  because those people didn't do the job of this country. [[08:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29337.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[08:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29341.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[08:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29346.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[08:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29350.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[08:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29354.4s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[08:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29358.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[08:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29361.4s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[08:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29363.4s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[08:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29365.4s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[08:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29370.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[08:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29371.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country, my first term. [[08:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29373.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[08:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29377.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[08:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29379.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[08:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29384.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other President. [[08:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29386.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[08:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29389.4s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[08:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29392.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[08:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29395.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[08:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29397.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29400.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29401.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[08:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29402.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29403.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29409.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[08:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29410.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[08:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29416.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[08:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29421.4s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[08:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29428.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[08:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29430.4s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important that it ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, [[08:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29433.4s)]
*  dying, young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[08:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29441.4s)]
*  And we want to — we want to end that war. [[08:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29446.4s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[08:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29450.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[08:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29452.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[08:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29454.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[08:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29456.4s)]
*  And the meetings are taking place right now. [[08:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29459.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[08:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29462.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[08:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29470.4s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[08:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29472.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[08:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29479.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[08:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29484.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[08:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29486.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us. [[08:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29489.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29492.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[08:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29494.4s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[08:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29495.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[08:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29501.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[08:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29503.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[08:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29505.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[08:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29508.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[08:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29509.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[08:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29512.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[08:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29515.4s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[08:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29519.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[08:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29528.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[08:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29532.4s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives. [[08:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29534.4s)]
*  And on trade, we have also emphasized that we can do something. [[08:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29539.4s)]
*  We can benefit both of us by trading. [[08:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29544.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[08:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29547.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[08:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29549.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[08:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29551.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29559.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[08:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29560.4s)]
*  Any questions? [[08:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29562.4s)]
*  Yes. [[08:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29564.4s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[08:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29565.4s)]
*  Is there a chance that you could lower the rates of those? [[08:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29571.4s)]
*  I think about trade and we understand each other very well. [[08:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29573.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[08:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29577.4s)]
*  Do you think that we can get an agreement? [[08:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29579.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[08:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29580.4s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[08:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29583.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit for President Kampenar? [[08:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29587.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[08:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29589.4s)]
*  I love it. [[08:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29590.4s)]
*  I mean, I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[08:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29591.4s)]
*  They have. [[08:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29595.4s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[08:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29596.4s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[08:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29599.4s)]
*  I would like to have him. [[08:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29601.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[08:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29602.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[08:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29606.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[08:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29616.4s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[08:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29623.4s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[08:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29628.4s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. [[08:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29631.4s)]
*  It's the war. [[08:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29633.4s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[08:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29634.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[08:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29636.4s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[08:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29643.4s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were president. [[08:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29645.4s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. [[08:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29648.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[08:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29655.4s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[08:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29657.4s)]
*  It's horrible. [[08:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29659.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[08:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29661.4s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week on average. [[08:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29662.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[08:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29667.4s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[08:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29668.4s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[08:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29671.4s)]
*  Do you think Russia, that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[08:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29674.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[08:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29683.4s)]
*  I do. [[08:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29684.4s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[08:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29685.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[08:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29687.4s)]
*  I hope so. Soon. [[08:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29689.4s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[08:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29690.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[08:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29698.4s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[08:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29701.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[08:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29704.4s)]
*  What are you expecting of your allies? [[08:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29706.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[08:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29707.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[08:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29711.4s)]
*  International peace. [[08:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29713.4s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[08:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29714.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words Vladimir, stop. [[08:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29715.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[08:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29720.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[08:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29724.4s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[08:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29727.4s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[08:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29728.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[08:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29730.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[08:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29734.4s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[08:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29736.4s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's... [[08:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29737.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[08:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29740.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[08:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29742.4s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[08:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29743.4s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[08:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29748.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[08:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29751.4s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[08:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29752.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[08:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29754.4s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[08:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29756.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[08:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29758.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[08:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29760.4s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans... [[08:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29763.4s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[08:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29764.4s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[08:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29765.4s)]
*  They're dealing. [[08:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29767.4s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[08:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29768.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[08:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29770.4s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[08:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29771.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[08:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29773.4s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[08:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29775.4s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know. [[08:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29777.4s)]
*  Or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[08:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29778.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[08:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29780.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[08:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29783.4s)]
*  He's talking. [[08:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29784.4s)]
*  And we're putting a lot of pressure. [[08:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29785.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[08:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29787.4s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[08:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29788.4s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[08:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29789.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[08:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29792.4s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[08:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29795.4s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[08:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29797.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President. [[08:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29800.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, if I may. [[08:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29803.4s)]
*  You've said that it's... [[08:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29805.4s)]
*  That Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[08:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29808.4s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. [[08:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29813.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[08:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29814.4s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told me that he does not agree. [[08:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29816.4s)]
*  And he believes in the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[08:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29824.4s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[08:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29828.4s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine and have to give... [[08:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29830.4s)]
*  The former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[08:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29833.4s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[08:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29837.4s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[08:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29839.4s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[08:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29844.4s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[08:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29845.4s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[08:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29846.4s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[08:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29848.4s)]
*  Very successful. [[08:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29850.4s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[08:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29852.4s)]
*  He's right here. [[08:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29854.4s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[08:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29855.4s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[08:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29861.4s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[08:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29863.4s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[08:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29864.4s)]
*  And we'll get... [[08:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29866.4s)]
*  We'll do the best we can. [[08:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29867.4s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[08:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29868.4s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[08:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29871.4s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[08:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29873.4s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[08:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29879.4s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[08:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29881.4s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[08:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29884.4s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[08:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29887.4s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[08:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29888.4s)]
*  There was no anything. [[08:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29890.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[08:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29891.4s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[08:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29892.4s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[08:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29894.4s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was President, not by Donald Trump. [[08:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29898.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[08:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29903.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a new peace proposal that you've put on the table. [[08:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29904.4s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[08:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29907.4s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[08:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29909.4s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal immediately. [[08:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29913.4s)]
*  Russia has not. [[08:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29918.4s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[08:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29919.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[08:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29926.4s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[08:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29927.4s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[08:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29929.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[08:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29931.4s)]
*  Complicated. [[08:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29932.4s)]
*  Very complicated. [[08:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29933.4s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[08:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29934.4s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[08:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29938.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[08:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29939.4s)]
*  This war is endable. [[08:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29946.4s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[08:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29947.4s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[08:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29949.4s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[08:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29950.4s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[08:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29951.4s)]
*  There'll be good meetings over the weekend. [[08:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29952.4s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[08:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29954.4s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[08:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29955.4s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[08:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29957.4s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles land. [[08:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29961.4s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today [[08:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29962.4s)]
*  because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[08:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29967.4s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[08:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29970.4s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[08:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29973.4s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, you know, but we're trying to end the dying. [[08:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29975.4s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[08:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29979.4s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[08:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29981.4s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[08:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29983.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[08:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29986.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[08:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29988.4s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[08:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29989.4s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people and we are nice people, [[08:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29991.4s)]
*  but we're using a lot of pressure on them. [[08:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29995.4s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, [[08:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=29997.4s)]
*  what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[08:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30001.4s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[08:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30008.4s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[08:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30010.4s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[08:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30013.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[08:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30015.4s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[08:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30017.4s)]
*  To buy more? [[08:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30025.4s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[08:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30027.4s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[08:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30029.4s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[08:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30031.4s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[08:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30033.4s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[08:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30035.4s)]
*  We have, we've had a great relationship. [[08:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30038.4s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[08:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30040.4s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[08:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30045.4s)]
*  You can't do better. [[08:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30047.4s)]
*  Really? Not even by, say, fighting against the... [[08:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30049.4s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[08:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30051.4s)]
*  You can't do much better. Yes, yes. [[08:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30054.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[08:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30056.4s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, [[08:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30059.4s)]
*  if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[08:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30063.4s)]
*  Totally. It's totally common ground. [[08:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30069.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[08:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30071.4s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. He's going to help us end it. [[08:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30079.4s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, [[08:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30082.4s)]
*  U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[08:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30090.4s)]
*  That is clear. That is obvious. It's really happening. [[08:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30094.4s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, [[08:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30097.4s)]
*  and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[08:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30101.4s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. They are defending themselves. [[08:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30104.4s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[08:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30108.4s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, [[08:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30111.4s)]
*  the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[08:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30115.4s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[08:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30118.4s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[08:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30120.4s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[08:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30123.4s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now. [[08:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30128.4s)]
*  I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[08:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30132.4s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[08:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30137.4s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[08:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30139.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[08:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30141.4s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[08:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30144.4s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[08:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30146.4s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[08:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30152.4s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[08:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30156.4s)]
*  Sir, Mr. President, if... [[08:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30159.4s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[08:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30163.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[08:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30166.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[08:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30168.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[08:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30170.4s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[08:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30172.4s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more patriot missiles. [[08:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30175.4s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[08:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30180.4s)]
*  If you and the United States decide to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, [[08:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30184.4s)]
*  does that also mean a no on patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[08:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30191.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[08:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30197.4s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[08:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30199.4s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[08:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30201.4s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[08:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30203.4s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[08:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30205.4s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[08:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30208.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[08:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30210.4s)]
*  You said once the President... [[08:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30215.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the liberation day. [[08:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30217.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[08:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30224.4s)]
*  Because I like them. [[08:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30228.4s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[08:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30230.4s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[08:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30235.4s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[08:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30237.4s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[08:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30239.4s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[08:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30240.4s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[08:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30242.4s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[08:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30244.4s)]
*  Absolutely. You get me that invitation. [[08:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30247.4s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[08:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30250.4s)]
*  President Trump, first time in court. [[08:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30253.4s)]
*  You said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[08:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30255.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and what our... [[08:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30261.4s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[08:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30269.4s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward, despite having these incomes, [[08:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30277.4s)]
*  which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest and we have transferred that into investments, [[08:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30285.4s)]
*  half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[08:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30291.4s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[08:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30294.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[08:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30298.4s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and a way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[08:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30303.4s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the finance minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[08:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30314.4s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a finance minister today. What do you say? [[08:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30319.4s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them on if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, [[08:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30323.4s)]
*  because we have a good experience with our fund. [[08:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30332.4s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, close to one trillion U.S. dollars, [[08:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30335.4s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[08:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30343.4s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[08:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30351.4s)]
*  And just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, the path forward to peace. [[08:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30359.4s)]
*  And as the prime minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[08:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30367.4s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine. [[08:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30373.4s)]
*  And this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine, that will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[08:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30382.4s)]
*  If there is a peace, and there will be a peace, we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[08:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30391.4s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[08:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30399.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[08:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30404.4s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. [[08:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30412.4s)]
*  Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the prime minister, do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[08:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30416.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. It's a big fund. And they don't have any debt. [[08:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30426.4s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[08:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30434.4s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[08:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30437.4s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions with Russia? [[08:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30447.4s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. This is a war that is horrible. [[08:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30454.4s)]
*  All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[08:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30460.4s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[08:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30464.4s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[08:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30471.4s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[08:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30475.4s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[08:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30482.4s)]
*  I think it was the apple of his eye. You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye. [[08:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30486.4s)]
*  But we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[08:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30491.4s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[08:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30495.4s)]
*  And it was only when I get out and, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[08:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30499.4s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country. [[08:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30507.4s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. [[08:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30513.4s)]
*  And that was a big that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[08:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30519.4s)]
*  But this is in my war. This is Biden's war. [[08:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30523.4s)]
*  This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[08:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30527.4s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. [[08:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30532.4s)]
*  And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[08:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30536.4s)]
*  Otherwise, and the prime minister had a statement. [[08:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30540.4s)]
*  He said, this is just a point in time. [[08:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30543.4s)]
*  We're very lucky because this is a point. [[08:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30546.4s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[08:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30548.4s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have a meeting with other world leaders in your own future Democrat president? [[08:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30551.4s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. [[08:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30557.4s)]
*  I think he wants to end it. [[08:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30562.4s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. [[08:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30564.4s)]
*  We're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[08:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30566.4s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[08:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30568.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[08:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30574.4s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[08:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30575.4s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. [[08:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30577.4s)]
*  That would be nice. I'd like to take care of all of them. [[08:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30579.4s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. [[08:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30582.4s)]
*  They want to meet about trade. [[08:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30585.4s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. [[08:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30587.4s)]
*  You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[08:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30591.4s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the public of South Korea today. [[08:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30593.4s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[08:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30599.4s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[08:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30602.4s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. [[08:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30611.4s)]
*  And we will see if they follow through on that. [[08:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30615.4s)]
*  Prime Minister, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you match it with the Great East? [[08:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30618.4s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[08:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30625.4s)]
*  If you match the Great East. [[08:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30627.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. [[08:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30628.4s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[08:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30630.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. [[08:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30635.4s)]
*  A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[08:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30638.4s)]
*  You know, we have four and Biden did nothing on that one, too. [[08:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30640.4s)]
*  It's the same four. [[08:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30644.4s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. [[08:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30646.4s)]
*  And it's worked out very well. [[08:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30648.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. [[08:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30650.4s)]
*  They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[08:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30652.4s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[08:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30656.4s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[08:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30658.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. [[08:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30662.4s)]
*  Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[08:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30663.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. [[08:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30670.4s)]
*  That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[08:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30671.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[08:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30674.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[08:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30678.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[08:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30686.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second and we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[08:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30689.4s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[08:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30697.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran and we're having very serious meetings. [[08:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30702.4s)]
*  And there are only two options. [[08:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30709.4s)]
*  And the one option is not a good option. [[08:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30712.4s)]
*  It's not a good option at all. [[08:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30715.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[08:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30718.4s)]
*  But that one, we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[08:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30723.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[08:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30726.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[08:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30729.4s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[08:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30734.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[08:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30745.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[08:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30747.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S.U.S.? [[08:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30750.4s)]
*  No, they had very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[08:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30754.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[08:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30757.4s)]
*  I did. [[08:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30765.4s)]
*  Energy just hit $1.98 in a couple of states. [[08:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30766.4s)]
*  It's way down. [[08:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30769.4s)]
*  Energy is down. [[08:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30770.4s)]
*  And we're about $64 a barrel. [[08:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30771.4s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at $89, $90, $95. [[08:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30774.4s)]
*  And, by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[08:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30778.4s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[08:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30780.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[08:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30787.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were complaining about eggs. [[08:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30789.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[08:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30795.4s)]
*  I've been here for — I was here for about a week when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[08:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30797.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[08:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30802.4s)]
*  Tell me about eggs. [[08:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30803.4s)]
*  And they happened. [[08:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30804.4s)]
*  They went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[08:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30805.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[08:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30808.4s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[08:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30812.4s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[08:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30814.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[08:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30817.4s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[08:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30819.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. [[08:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30821.4s)]
*  That's the Fed. [[08:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30823.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. [[08:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30824.4s)]
*  That's the smart thing to do. [[08:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30825.4s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[08:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30827.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country. [[08:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30830.4s)]
*  We have a very strong country. [[08:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30833.4s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[08:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30834.4s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[08:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30836.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[08:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30840.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these — it would be physically impossible. [[08:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30845.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[08:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30850.4s)]
*  And we are going to, at some point, just set prices for deals. [[08:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30855.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[08:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30861.4s)]
*  Some treat it as very unfairly. [[08:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30863.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[08:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30865.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[08:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30867.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[08:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30869.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[08:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30876.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[08:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30881.4s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[08:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30883.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[08:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30885.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do, where we virtually take care of their military [[08:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30888.4s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[08:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30893.4s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[08:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30895.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[08:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30898.4s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[08:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30902.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[08:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30906.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[08:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30911.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[08:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30915.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[08:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30919.4s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[08:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30922.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[08:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30926.4s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[08:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30927.4s)]
*  I blamed the President of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[08:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30929.4s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[08:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30935.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[08:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30936.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[08:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30938.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[08:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30942.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[08:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30944.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[08:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30949.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other President. [[08:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30950.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[08:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30953.4s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[08:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30956.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[08:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30960.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[08:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30962.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30965.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[08:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30966.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30967.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30973.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30974.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[08:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30975.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[08:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30981.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[08:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30986.4s)]
*  We're doing very well, I think, on both. [[08:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30993.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[08:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30996.4s)]
*  And every respect to war is very important. [[08:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=30998.4s)]
*  It's very important that it ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, [[08:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31001.4s)]
*  dying — young people, mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[08:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31007.4s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[08:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31012.4s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[08:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31016.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a long — a lot of progress. [[08:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31018.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[08:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31020.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[08:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31022.4s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[08:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31024.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will — definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[08:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31027.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[08:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31035.4s)]
*  But I think the Prime Minister knows that, over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[08:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31036.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[08:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31044.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[08:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31049.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[08:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31051.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you the way this. [[08:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31054.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31058.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[08:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31059.4s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[08:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31061.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[08:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31067.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[08:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31069.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[08:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31070.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[08:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31073.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[08:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31074.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[08:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31077.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[08:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31080.4s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[08:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31085.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[08:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31094.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[08:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31098.4s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[08:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31100.4s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[08:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31107.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[08:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31112.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[08:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31114.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[08:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31117.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[08:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31125.4s)]
*  Any questions, please? [[08:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31128.4s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[08:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31130.4s)]
*  We spoke about trade and we understand each other very well. [[08:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31137.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[08:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31142.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[08:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31144.4s)]
*  Did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[08:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31148.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit to President Trump? [[08:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31151.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. [[08:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31154.4s)]
*  I love it. [[08:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31155.4s)]
*  I mean, I've been there and it is a beautiful place. [[08:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31156.4s)]
*  But I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[08:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31160.4s)]
*  He's welcome to visit Norway. [[08:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31164.4s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[08:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31166.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[08:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31167.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[08:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31171.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[08:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31181.4s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[08:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31188.4s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives and I want to save a lot of lives. [[08:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31193.4s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war. [[08:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31196.4s)]
*  It's the soldiers. [[08:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31200.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[08:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31201.4s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[08:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31209.4s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[08:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31210.4s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this and it's a shame. [[08:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31212.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[08:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31219.4s)]
*  And then I looked at and I see the results. [[08:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31221.4s)]
*  It's horrible. [[08:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31224.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[08:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31225.4s)]
*  Five thousand soldiers a week on average. [[08:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31227.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[08:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31230.4s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[08:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31232.4s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[08:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31235.4s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe will accept? [[08:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31238.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[08:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31248.4s)]
*  I do. [[08:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31249.4s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[08:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31250.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[08:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31252.4s)]
*  I hope so. Soon. [[08:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31254.4s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[08:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31255.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[08:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31263.4s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[08:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31266.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[08:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31269.4s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[08:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31271.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[08:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31272.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[08:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31276.4s)]
*  Yeah, please go ahead. [[08:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31278.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Social Post you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[08:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31279.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[08:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31285.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[08:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31289.4s)]
*  I didn't like last night. [[08:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31292.4s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[08:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31293.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[08:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31295.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[08:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31299.4s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[08:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31301.4s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's... [[08:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31302.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm quiet. [[08:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31304.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[08:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31306.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[08:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31307.4s)]
*  Yeah, I assume. [[08:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31308.4s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[08:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31309.4s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[08:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31313.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[08:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31316.4s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[08:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31317.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[08:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31319.4s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[08:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31321.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[08:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31323.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[08:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31325.4s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans... [[08:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31328.4s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[08:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31329.4s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[08:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31330.4s)]
*  They're dealing. [[08:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31332.4s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[08:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31333.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[08:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31335.4s)]
*  And you may be telling us that... [[08:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31336.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[08:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31338.4s)]
*  And Russia knows that. [[08:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31340.4s)]
*  And some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[08:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31342.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[08:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31345.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[08:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31348.4s)]
*  He's talking, and we're putting a lot of pressure. [[08:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31349.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[08:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31352.4s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[08:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31353.4s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[08:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31355.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[08:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31357.4s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[08:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31360.4s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[08:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31362.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. [[08:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31365.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, Mr. Prime Minister. [[08:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31368.4s)]
*  You've said that it's... [[08:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31370.4s)]
*  That Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace. [[08:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31373.4s)]
*  Among them, Crimea. [[08:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31378.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[08:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31379.4s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree. [[08:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31380.4s)]
*  And he believes in territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[08:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31388.4s)]
*  How would you deal with that with your allies? [[08:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31393.4s)]
*  And do you stand by that Ukraine have to give... [[08:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31395.4s)]
*  Former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[08:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31397.4s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[08:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31401.4s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[08:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31404.4s)]
*  Because that's what you are. [[08:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31409.4s)]
*  Really, you're a general. [[08:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31410.4s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[08:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31411.4s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship. [[08:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31413.4s)]
*  Very successful. [[08:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31415.4s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[08:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31416.4s)]
*  He's right here. [[08:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31419.4s)]
*  But do you still agree that Ukraine have to give some territory away to win peace? [[08:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31420.4s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[08:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31426.4s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[08:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31428.4s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[08:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31429.4s)]
*  And we'll do the best we can. [[08:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31430.4s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[08:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31431.4s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[08:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31434.4s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a President named Barack Hussein Obama. [[08:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31436.4s)]
*  That had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[08:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31442.4s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[08:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31445.4s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[08:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31448.4s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fired. [[08:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31451.4s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[08:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31452.4s)]
*  There was no anything. [[08:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31453.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[08:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31454.4s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[08:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31455.4s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[08:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31459.4s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was President, not by Donald Trump. [[08:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31463.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[08:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31468.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you have a peace proposal that you put on the table. [[08:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31469.4s)]
*  It's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[08:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31472.4s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[08:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31474.4s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[08:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31478.4s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[08:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31482.4s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that? [[08:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31484.4s)]
*  Just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[08:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31489.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[08:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31491.4s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[08:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31492.4s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[08:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31494.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[08:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31496.4s)]
*  Complicated. [[08:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31497.4s)]
*  Very complicated. [[08:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31498.4s)]
*  But I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[08:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31499.4s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[08:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31503.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[08:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31505.4s)]
*  This war is endable. [[08:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31511.4s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[08:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31512.4s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[08:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31513.4s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[08:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31515.4s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[08:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31516.4s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[08:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31517.4s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[08:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31518.4s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[08:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31520.4s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[08:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31521.4s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[08:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31526.4s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues and the President wants to stop it. [[08:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31527.4s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the President for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[08:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31534.4s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[08:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31538.4s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it. [[08:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31539.4s)]
*  It's not our war we didn't start it, as you know. [[08:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31541.4s)]
*  But we're trying to end the dying. [[08:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31542.4s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[08:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31544.4s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[08:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31546.4s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[08:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31548.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[08:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31551.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[08:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31553.4s)]
*  Both of them. [[08:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31554.4s)]
*  And we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[08:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31555.4s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[08:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31556.4s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[08:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31560.4s)]
*  What concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the end of the war? [[08:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31562.4s)]
*  What concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[08:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31570.4s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[08:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31573.4s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[08:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31575.4s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[08:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31578.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[08:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31580.4s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the US? [[08:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31582.4s)]
*  To buy more? [[08:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31591.4s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[08:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31593.4s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[08:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31595.4s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[08:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31597.4s)]
*  We have a lot of them. [[08:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31599.4s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[08:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31601.4s)]
*  We have had a great relationship. [[08:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31603.4s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever. [[08:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31606.4s)]
*  But we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[08:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31608.4s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[08:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31610.4s)]
*  You can't do better. [[08:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31612.4s)]
*  Really? [[08:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31614.4s)]
*  Not even by, say, a fight? [[08:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31615.4s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[08:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31617.4s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[08:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31619.4s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[08:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31621.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[08:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31622.4s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right. [[08:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31624.4s)]
*  But on Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[08:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31627.4s)]
*  Totally. [[08:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31634.4s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[08:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31635.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[08:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31637.4s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[08:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31644.4s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[08:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31646.4s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, US engagement is critical? [[08:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31648.4s)]
*  And President Trump made that possible. [[08:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31656.4s)]
*  That is clear. [[08:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31658.4s)]
*  That is obvious. [[08:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31659.4s)]
*  It's really happening. [[08:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31660.4s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[08:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31662.4s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[08:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31669.4s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[08:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31671.4s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[08:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31673.4s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the US some time ago. [[08:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31675.4s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[08:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31682.4s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[08:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31684.4s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[08:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31688.4s)]
*  And here I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump of being, you know, opening that process. [[08:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31692.4s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[08:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31702.4s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[08:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31704.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[08:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31706.4s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[08:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31709.4s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[08:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31711.4s)]
*  It can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[08:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31717.4s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[08:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31721.4s)]
*  Sir, Mr. President, if... [[08:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31724.4s)]
*  I forgot my question. [[08:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31727.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[08:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31730.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[08:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31733.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[08:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31735.4s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[08:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31736.4s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more Patriot missiles. [[08:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31739.4s)]
*  So far there has been no response from the United States. [[08:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31744.4s)]
*  If the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, strike a broker piece, does that also mean a no on Patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[08:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31749.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[08:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31762.4s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[08:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31764.4s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[08:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31766.4s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[08:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31768.4s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[08:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31770.4s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[08:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31773.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[08:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31776.4s)]
*  You said once the President... [[08:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31780.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the liberation day. [[08:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31782.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[08:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31790.4s)]
*  Because I like them. [[08:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31794.4s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[08:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31796.4s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[08:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31800.4s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[08:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31803.4s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[08:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31805.4s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[08:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31806.4s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[08:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31808.4s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[08:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31810.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[08:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31813.4s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[08:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31814.4s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit Norway. [[08:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31816.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[08:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31819.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and what our resources are. [[08:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31826.4s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[08:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31834.4s)]
*  Yes. [[08:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31842.4s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate, and move forward despite having these incomes, [[08:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31843.4s)]
*  which we happen to be in a period of history where we can harvest, and we have transferred that into investments. [[08:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31850.4s)]
*  Half of them, by the way, are in the United States. [[08:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31856.4s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[08:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31859.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[08:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31863.4s)]
*  You never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and a way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[08:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31868.4s)]
*  Jens Stoltmer was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund. [[08:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31878.4s)]
*  So he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. [[08:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31884.4s)]
*  What do you say? [[08:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31888.4s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them on if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, [[08:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31889.4s)]
*  because we have a very good experience with our fund. [[08:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31897.4s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, close to one trillion U.S. dollars, [[08:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31900.4s)]
*  are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[08:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31908.4s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[08:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31916.4s)]
*  Just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, the path forward to peace. [[08:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31924.4s)]
*  And as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward to try to find a negotiated solution. [[08:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31932.4s)]
*  At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[08:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31938.4s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[08:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31947.4s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[08:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31953.4s)]
*  If there is a peace, and there will be a peace, we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future. [[08:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31956.4s)]
*  And the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[08:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31964.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[08:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31969.4s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister. [[08:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31977.4s)]
*  Do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[08:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31985.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. [[08:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31991.4s)]
*  It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt. [[08:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31995.4s)]
*  So I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[08:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=31999.4s)]
*  Are there any issues in agreement with which countries? [[08:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32003.4s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[08:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32006.4s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[08:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32012.4s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. [[08:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32019.4s)]
*  This is a war that is horrible. All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad. [[08:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32022.4s)]
*  And I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this because so many lives have been lost. [[08:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32029.4s)]
*  Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[08:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32036.4s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. [[08:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32040.4s)]
*  It would have never happened if I were president. Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. [[08:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32045.4s)]
*  You know, people say, how do you know that? Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. [[08:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32049.4s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye. [[08:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32053.4s)]
*  You know, Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[08:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32056.4s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. [[08:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32062.4s)]
*  And it was only when I got out. And, you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine years ago under President Obama [[08:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32067.4s)]
*  and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country, what happened is large chunks of lead were given up. [[08:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32075.4s)]
*  And it was called Crimea. And that was a big that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[08:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32085.4s)]
*  But this is in my war. This is Biden's war. This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[08:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32091.4s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[08:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32100.4s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. He said, this is just a point in time. We're very lucky because this is a point. [[08:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32106.4s)]
*  If this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[08:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32113.4s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome, sir? [[08:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32117.4s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. I think he wants to end it. [[08:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32121.4s)]
*  And I feel pretty confident of that. But we're going to we're going to know pretty soon. [[08:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32129.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you're ending your first state meeting with other world leaders when you're in Rome. [[08:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32133.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[08:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32139.4s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[08:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32140.4s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. I'd like to take care of all of them. [[08:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32142.4s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet and they want to meet about trade. [[08:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32147.4s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads in great deals. You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[08:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32152.4s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[08:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32158.4s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought, and we will be talking technical terms as early as next week as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[08:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32164.4s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. And we will see if they follow through on that. [[08:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32176.4s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you measure the creation? [[08:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32183.4s)]
*  Do I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[08:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32190.4s)]
*  If you measure creation. [[08:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32192.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[08:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32193.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[08:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32200.4s)]
*  You know, we have four and Biden did nothing on that one, too. It's the same four. [[08:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32205.4s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. And it's worked out very well. [[08:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32211.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. They're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[08:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32215.4s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[08:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32221.4s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to to grow the Abraham Accords. [[08:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32224.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing of all the leaders in the world today. [[08:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32227.4s)]
*  No leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[08:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32230.4s)]
*  We're trying. That's why we're talking to Iran. That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[08:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32235.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[08:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32239.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[08:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32243.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[08:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32251.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second. [[08:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32253.4s)]
*  And we could, Mr. Prime Minister, and you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[08:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32261.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran and we're having very serious meetings. [[08:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32267.4s)]
*  And there are only two options, and one option is not a good option. [[08:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32274.4s)]
*  It's not a not a good option at all. [[08:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32279.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on a an agreement with Iran. [[08:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32282.4s)]
*  But that one we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[08:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32288.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[08:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32291.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[08:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32294.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, on the economy, [[08:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32299.4s)]
*  there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[08:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32303.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[08:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32310.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[08:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32312.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S. economy? [[08:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32315.4s)]
*  No, they have very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[08:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32319.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[08:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32322.4s)]
*  I did. Energy just hit one dollar and 98 cents in a couple of states. [[08:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32330.4s)]
*  It's way down. Energy is down. [[08:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32334.4s)]
*  And we're about sixty four dollars a barrel when I came in and we were looking at eighty nine ninety ninety five dollars. [[08:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32336.4s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war to having those energy prices is a big a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[08:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32343.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[08:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32353.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were you were complaining about eggs. [[08:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32355.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I've been here for I was here for about a week when the when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[08:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32360.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. Tell me about eggs. [[08:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32368.4s)]
*  And they happened. They were they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[08:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32370.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House, thousands and thousands of eggs. [[08:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32373.4s)]
*  And the price was down 87 percent. [[08:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32379.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. Housing is doing very well. [[08:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32382.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. That's the Fed. [[08:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32386.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. That's a smart thing to do. [[08:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32389.4s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[08:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32392.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country. [[08:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32395.4s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[08:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32399.4s)]
*  I can't think of one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[09:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32401.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair. [[09:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32405.4s)]
*  Because we don't have to go through all of these. [[09:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32410.4s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. [[09:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32413.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, [[09:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32415.4s)]
*  which is a very small group of people here. [[09:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32418.4s)]
*  And we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. [[09:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32421.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. Some treated us very unfairly. [[09:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32426.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[09:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32430.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[09:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32432.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world [[09:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32434.4s)]
*  has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[09:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32438.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[09:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32441.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[09:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32446.4s)]
*  And military is another subject we talk about. [[09:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32448.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[09:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32450.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do, [[09:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32453.4s)]
*  where we virtually take care of their military [[09:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32456.4s)]
*  and then don't get treated fairly on trade. [[09:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32458.4s)]
*  So the people — and I don't blame those countries. [[09:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32460.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you. [[09:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32463.4s)]
*  Because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[09:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32467.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[09:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32471.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[09:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32476.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[09:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32480.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[09:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32484.4s)]
*  So — but the — I don't blame any country. [[09:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32488.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. And we were abused by countries. [[09:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32491.4s)]
*  I blame the President of the United States that happened to be sitting [[09:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32495.4s)]
*  where these deals were made. Disgraceful. [[09:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32499.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[09:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32502.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country, my first term. [[09:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32504.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[09:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32508.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[09:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32510.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[09:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32514.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[09:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32516.4s)]
*  And they — but not only China. [[09:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32519.4s)]
*  Virtually every country got away with murder. [[09:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32522.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[09:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32526.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you very much. [[09:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32528.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32532.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32539.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturas here, who is the — as you know, the Prime Minister of Norway. [[09:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32540.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[09:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32546.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[09:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32551.4s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[09:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32559.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[09:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32561.4s)]
*  And every respect, the war is very important. [[09:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32564.4s)]
*  It ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, dying — young people, [[09:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32567.4s)]
*  mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[09:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32573.4s)]
*  And we want to end that war. We want to end it quickly. [[09:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32577.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a lot of progress. [[09:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32582.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[09:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32585.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[09:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32587.4s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[09:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32589.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will definitely — we get along very well on trade. [[09:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32592.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[09:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32600.4s)]
*  I think the Prime Minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[09:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32602.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[09:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32609.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[09:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32614.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[09:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32616.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you. [[09:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32619.4s)]
*  The White House. Thank you very much. [[09:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32622.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[09:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32624.4s)]
*  This is — this year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[09:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32626.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[09:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32631.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[09:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32633.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[09:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32635.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[09:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32638.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[09:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32639.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[09:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32642.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[09:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32645.4s)]
*  I have saluted the President for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire [[09:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32650.4s)]
*  and an end to this terrible conflict. [[09:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32657.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[09:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32659.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[09:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32663.4s)]
*  And then I think the President and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[09:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32665.4s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[09:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32672.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[09:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32678.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[09:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32680.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, [[09:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32682.4s)]
*  which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[09:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32686.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32690.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[09:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32691.4s)]
*  Any questions? [[09:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32692.4s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[09:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32694.4s)]
*  Is there a chance that you can lower the tariffs? [[09:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32701.4s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[09:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32703.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[09:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32707.4s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[09:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32709.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[09:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32711.4s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss the possible visit to Norway? [[09:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32713.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[09:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32717.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I love it. [[09:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32719.4s)]
*  I mean, I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[09:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32721.4s)]
*  I told the President that, you know, he is receiving us early in the term. [[09:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32726.4s)]
*  He is welcome to visit Norway. [[09:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32730.4s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[09:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32731.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[09:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32733.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[09:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32738.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[09:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32747.4s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply, I have no allegiance to anybody. [[09:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32753.4s)]
*  I have allegiance to saving lives, and I want to save a lot of lives. [[09:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32758.4s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people, it's the war, it's the soldiers. [[09:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32761.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[09:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32766.4s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[09:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32774.4s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[09:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32775.4s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[09:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32778.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[09:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32785.4s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. [[09:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32787.4s)]
*  It's horrible. [[09:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32789.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[09:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32791.4s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[09:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32792.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. [[09:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32796.4s)]
*  We both want to stop that for a lot of reasons. [[09:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32798.4s)]
*  But I would say that is my number one reason. [[09:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32801.4s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe is willing to accept? [[09:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32803.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. [[09:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32814.4s)]
*  I do. [[09:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32815.4s)]
*  I believe they will accept. [[09:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32816.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with. [[09:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32817.4s)]
*  I hope so. [[09:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32819.4s)]
*  Soon. [[09:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32820.4s)]
*  You continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[09:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32821.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[09:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32828.4s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[09:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32831.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[09:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32834.4s)]
*  What are you expecting of your allies? [[09:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32836.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[09:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32837.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[09:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32841.4s)]
*  Here, please, go ahead. [[09:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32844.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a Truth Social Post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[09:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32845.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[09:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32850.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[09:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32854.4s)]
*  I didn't like it last night. [[09:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32857.4s)]
*  I wasn't happy with it. [[09:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32858.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[09:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32860.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. [[09:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32864.4s)]
*  That's what I meant. [[09:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32866.4s)]
*  And that's, you know, what it's been. [[09:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32867.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[09:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32870.4s)]
*  Sorry. [[09:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32872.4s)]
*  If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[09:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32873.4s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[09:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32878.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. [[09:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32881.4s)]
*  I want to see if we can have a deal. [[09:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32883.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. [[09:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32884.4s)]
*  Let me put it that way. [[09:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32887.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[09:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32888.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[09:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32890.4s)]
*  I know a lot of Europeans are putting more pressure on Russia. [[09:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32893.4s)]
*  Putting a lot of pressure. [[09:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32895.4s)]
*  You don't know what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[09:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32896.4s)]
*  They're dealing. [[09:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32897.4s)]
*  You have no idea what pressure I'm putting on Russia. [[09:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32898.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure. [[09:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32900.4s)]
*  Can you maybe tell us something? [[09:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32902.4s)]
*  We're putting a lot of pressure on Russia. [[09:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32903.4s)]
*  And Russia knows that, and some people that are close to it know, or he wouldn't be talking right now. [[09:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32905.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister understands that better than anybody. [[09:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32910.4s)]
*  He wouldn't be talking right now. [[09:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32913.4s)]
*  He's talking, and we're putting a lot of pressure. [[09:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32915.4s)]
*  I think he wants to make a deal. [[09:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32917.4s)]
*  We're going to find out very soon. [[09:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32918.4s)]
*  But it takes two to tango. [[09:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32920.4s)]
*  And you have to have Ukraine want to make a deal, too. [[09:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32922.4s)]
*  And they're being hit very hard. [[09:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32925.4s)]
*  And I do believe they want to make a deal. [[09:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32927.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President. [[09:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32930.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. [[09:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32933.4s)]
*  You've said that the Ukraine has to give some territory to win peace, among them Crimea. [[09:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32935.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that? [[09:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32945.4s)]
*  And I know that the former NATO General Secretary today has told you that he does not agree, [[09:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32947.4s)]
*  and he believes in the territorial integrity of the Ukraine. [[09:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32954.4s)]
*  How will you deal with that with your allies? [[09:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32959.4s)]
*  Well, the former — [[09:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32961.4s)]
*  Do you stand by that Ukraine has to give — [[09:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32962.4s)]
*  The former Secretary General happens to be right here, you know. [[09:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32963.4s)]
*  So they can't put words in his mouth. [[09:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32967.4s)]
*  He's been a great general, frankly. [[09:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32969.4s)]
*  Because that's what you are, really. [[09:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32974.4s)]
*  You're a general. [[09:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32976.4s)]
*  But he's been a great Secretary General. [[09:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32977.4s)]
*  We had a tremendous relationship, very successful. [[09:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32979.4s)]
*  And I think he could speak for himself. [[09:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32982.4s)]
*  He's right here. [[09:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32985.4s)]
*  Do you still agree that Ukraine has to give some territory away to win peace? [[09:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32986.4s)]
*  Well, it depends what territory. [[09:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32992.4s)]
*  They've been fighting. [[09:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32994.4s)]
*  They've lost a lot of territory. [[09:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32995.4s)]
*  And we'll get — we'll do the best we can. [[09:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32997.4s)]
*  Working with Ukraine, we'll do the best we can. [[09:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=32999.4s)]
*  But they lost a lot of territory. [[09:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33002.4s)]
*  When you say Crimea, that was handed over during a president named Barack Hussein Obama. [[09:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33004.4s)]
*  That was — had nothing to do with me, Crimea. [[09:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33010.4s)]
*  That was 11 years ago with Obama. [[09:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33012.4s)]
*  And they made a decision. [[09:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33015.4s)]
*  There wasn't a bullet fire. [[09:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33018.4s)]
*  There was no fighting. [[09:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33019.4s)]
*  There was no anything. [[09:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33021.4s)]
*  They just handed it over. [[09:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33022.4s)]
*  Now they say, well, can you get it back? [[09:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33023.4s)]
*  I think that's going to be a very difficult thing to do. [[09:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33025.4s)]
*  That was given by Barack Obama when he was president, not by Donald Trump. [[09:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33028.4s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President. [[09:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33033.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I had a long meeting with this president. [[09:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33034.4s)]
*  The U.S. peace proposal that you put on the table — it's a 30-day ceasefire proposal. [[09:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33036.4s)]
*  Your national security team presented it to both Ukraine and Russia. [[09:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33039.4s)]
*  Two months ago, Ukraine agreed to that ceasefire proposal. [[09:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33044.4s)]
*  Immediately, Russia has not. [[09:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33047.4s)]
*  And my question is, is Russia the obstacle to peace based upon that, just getting to that 30-day ceasefire? [[09:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33050.4s)]
*  I don't think so. [[09:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33056.4s)]
*  I think that they both want peace right now. [[09:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33058.4s)]
*  They're ready to do something. [[09:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33060.4s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[09:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33062.4s)]
*  Complicated. [[09:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33063.4s)]
*  Very complicated. [[09:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33064.4s)]
*  I think they are both very much looking to make a deal. [[09:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33065.4s)]
*  Marco, what would you say? [[09:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33069.4s)]
*  Well, first of all, what was put before our partners was options to discuss about things that it would take to end a war. [[09:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33070.4s)]
*  This war is endable. [[09:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33076.4s)]
*  Both sides just have to agree to it. [[09:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33078.4s)]
*  We've shown them a pathway forward. [[09:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33079.4s)]
*  We've discussed those ideas. [[09:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33081.4s)]
*  There was a good meeting yesterday. [[09:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33082.4s)]
*  There will be good meetings over the weekend. [[09:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33083.4s)]
*  We've shown them the finish line. [[09:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33084.4s)]
*  We need both of them to say yes. [[09:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33086.4s)]
*  But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end. [[09:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33087.4s)]
*  It's horrible, those missiles landed. [[09:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33092.4s)]
*  What's even worse is there are today people that were alive yesterday that are not alive today because this war continues and the president wants to stop it. [[09:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33093.4s)]
*  And everyone should be thanking the president for being a peacemaker and trying to save lives. [[09:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33100.4s)]
*  That's what we're trying to do here. [[09:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33104.4s)]
*  It's not our war. [[09:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33105.4s)]
*  We didn't start it, you know, but we're trying to end the dying. [[09:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33106.4s)]
*  We're trying to end the destruction. [[09:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33109.4s)]
*  And we've shown the path forward. [[09:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33111.4s)]
*  We can see the finish line, but both of them have to get there. [[09:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33114.4s)]
*  We're going to do everything we can to help them get there. [[09:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33116.4s)]
*  But they have to ultimately say yes. [[09:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33118.4s)]
*  But we are using a lot of pressure on both. [[09:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33119.4s)]
*  You know, if you think we're just in there because we're nice people, then we are nice people. [[09:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33121.4s)]
*  But we're using a lot of pressure on both. [[09:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33125.4s)]
*  What concessions, what concessions, Mr. President, and to your national security team, what concessions has Russia offered up thus far to get to the point where you're closer to peace? [[09:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33127.4s)]
*  Stopping the war. [[09:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33138.4s)]
*  Stopping taking the whole country. [[09:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33140.4s)]
*  Pretty big concession. [[09:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33143.4s)]
*  Mr. President. [[09:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33146.4s)]
*  If you are going to take down the tariffs, what do you want Norway to buy more of from the U.S.? [[09:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33147.4s)]
*  To buy more? [[09:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33156.4s)]
*  Well, you don't need snow. [[09:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33158.4s)]
*  You don't need skis. [[09:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33160.4s)]
*  You don't need ski champions either, right? [[09:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33162.4s)]
*  You have a lot of them. [[09:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33164.4s)]
*  We just want to keep the relationship the way it is. [[09:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33166.4s)]
*  We have, we've had a great relationship. [[09:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33169.4s)]
*  I think now maybe closer than ever, but we've had a great relationship with Norway. [[09:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33171.4s)]
*  I think just keep it the way it is. [[09:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33175.4s)]
*  You can't do better. [[09:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33177.4s)]
*  Really? [[09:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33179.4s)]
*  Nothing by, say, fighting back? [[09:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33180.4s)]
*  Well, if they want to give us some additional concessions, that's okay. [[09:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33182.4s)]
*  You can't do much better. [[09:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33184.4s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[09:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33186.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you had a long meeting with Norway today. [[09:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33187.4s)]
*  You said that Norway is doing a lot of things right, but on the Ukraine, if I can ask both you and the Prime Minister, did you find common ground today on Ukraine and the peace plan? [[09:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33189.4s)]
*  Totally. [[09:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33199.4s)]
*  It's totally common ground. [[09:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33200.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister can speak about it, but I can just say he wants to see people stop dying more than anything else. [[09:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33202.4s)]
*  And he'd like to see it end. [[09:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33209.4s)]
*  He's going to help us end it. [[09:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33211.4s)]
*  Mr. President, can I say that to move towards an end of this war, U.S. engagement is critical, and President Trump made that possible. [[09:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33213.4s)]
*  That is clear. [[09:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33224.4s)]
*  That is obvious. [[09:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33225.4s)]
*  It's really happening. [[09:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33226.4s)]
*  Now, the important thing is that both parties have to know that they have to deliver, and they have to feel the pressure to deliver. [[09:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33228.4s)]
*  Ukraine is under attack. [[09:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33235.4s)]
*  They are defending themselves. [[09:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33237.4s)]
*  Lives are being lost. [[09:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33239.4s)]
*  And we believe very firmly that there needs to be a ceasefire, the initiative taken by the U.S. some time ago. [[09:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33241.4s)]
*  It needs to be respected. [[09:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33249.4s)]
*  And then to move on to something which both parties can own. [[09:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33251.4s)]
*  That is the complicated part in such a dramatic war. [[09:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33254.4s)]
*  And here, I believe Europeans and Americans working together, as we do much closer now, I salute the team of President Trump of being open in that process. [[09:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33258.4s)]
*  We had a good discussion on this today. [[09:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33267.4s)]
*  And then we have to move on. [[09:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33269.4s)]
*  And we cannot lose time because this is too much drama happening. [[09:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33271.4s)]
*  One thing is people losing their lives. [[09:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33274.4s)]
*  But it is a bad thing for Europe, and it's a bad thing for the world to have such a broad conflict going on. [[09:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33276.4s)]
*  So it can have ramifications far beyond Ukraine. [[09:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33283.4s)]
*  Mr. President, a follow-up question on China. [[09:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33287.4s)]
*  Mr. President, if... I forgot my question. [[09:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33290.4s)]
*  I wanted to ask about... [[09:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33296.4s)]
*  Sorry, that happens. [[09:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33299.4s)]
*  It happens sometimes, yeah. [[09:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33300.4s)]
*  No, Mr. President, I wanted to ask about the... [[09:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33302.4s)]
*  Well, actually, Zelensky has said that he wants more patriot missiles. [[09:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33305.4s)]
*  So far, there has been no response from the United States. [[09:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33310.4s)]
*  If you and the United States decides to pull out of negotiating for peace, trying to broker peace, does that also mean a no on patriot missiles, a no on sharing intelligence with Ukraine? [[09:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33314.4s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[09:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33327.4s)]
*  I think we're going to make a deal. [[09:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33329.4s)]
*  And if we make a deal, that'll be wonderful. [[09:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33330.4s)]
*  We won't have to worry about your question. [[09:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33332.4s)]
*  You can ask that question in two weeks, and we'll see. [[09:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33334.4s)]
*  And we'll see. [[09:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33338.4s)]
*  But I think we're getting very close. [[09:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33339.4s)]
*  The Prime Minister feels the same way, and we'll hopefully not have to answer that question. [[09:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33341.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway is the third country to be officially invited to the White House after the relation thing. [[09:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33346.4s)]
*  Why did you invite Norway so soon to the White House? [[09:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33355.4s)]
*  Because I like them. [[09:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33359.4s)]
*  And I like your Prime Minister, and I like the way your government runs. [[09:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33361.4s)]
*  And I respect the King. [[09:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33365.4s)]
*  He's highly respected in Norway. [[09:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33368.4s)]
*  It's a great thing. [[09:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33370.4s)]
*  Not an easy thing to do. [[09:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33371.4s)]
*  He's done a great job. [[09:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33373.4s)]
*  Would you like an invitation to visit the King? [[09:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33375.4s)]
*  Absolutely. [[09:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33378.4s)]
*  You get me that invitation. [[09:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33379.4s)]
*  I just told the President he's welcome to visit. [[09:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33381.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you said before that you like the Norwegian Petroleum Fund. [[09:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33384.4s)]
*  And I'm wondering if that has been up for discussion today, the way that we have structured our economy and what are the steps? [[09:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33391.4s)]
*  Well, this fund was created in the late 1990s to save for future generations the income from oil and gas. [[09:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33399.4s)]
*  Norwegians should continue to work as hard, dedicate, innovate and move forward, [[09:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33407.4s)]
*  despite having these incomes, which we happen to be in the period of our history where we can harvest, [[09:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33413.4s)]
*  and we have transferred that into investments, half of them, by the way, here in the United States. [[09:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33418.4s)]
*  So I think this is a model which we have been able to explore. [[09:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33424.4s)]
*  If we can share experiences, and we do with our colleagues in the U.S., [[09:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33428.4s)]
*  you never copy this one-to-one, but there can be techniques and a way of working that we have used in organizing our fund. [[09:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33433.4s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg was the Finance Minister when the first dollar entered that fund, [[09:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33442.4s)]
*  so he is a safe hand to have as a Finance Minister today. What do you say? [[09:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33448.4s)]
*  No, and as you said, Mr. Prime Minister, we are ready to sit down with the U.S. to also work with them [[09:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33453.4s)]
*  if they want to establish a sovereign wealth fund, because we have a good experience with our fund. [[09:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33459.4s)]
*  And I think that one example of how we work together with the United States is that half the fund, [[09:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33464.4s)]
*  close to one trillion U.S. dollars, are invested in the United States, mainly in equity, [[09:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33471.4s)]
*  but also some in fixed income, including government funds. [[09:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33478.4s)]
*  So this is an expression of trust in the United States, expressed by the strong investment of the sovereign wealth fund. [[09:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33482.4s)]
*  Then just briefly on Ukraine, since it was mentioned, we had a very good and extensive discussion about Ukraine, [[09:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33489.4s)]
*  the path forward to peace, and as the Prime Minister said, we commend the U.S. for pushing forward [[09:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33495.4s)]
*  to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, we need to continue to support Ukraine, [[09:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33501.4s)]
*  and therefore I'm proud that Norway has actually tripled the military support to Ukraine, [[09:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33507.4s)]
*  and this year we will allocate close to eight billion U.S. dollars to Ukraine. [[09:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33513.4s)]
*  That will strengthen them and also their hand on the negotiating table. [[09:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33518.4s)]
*  If there is a peace, and there will be a peace, we have a common responsibility in securing democratic Ukraine for the future, [[09:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33522.4s)]
*  and the best security guarantee they can have is the ability to defend themselves, and we are investing in that. [[09:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33529.4s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, as it relates to tariffs, Mr. President, when you unveiled your reciprocal tariffs on April 2nd, [[09:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33535.4s)]
*  the tariff rate for Norway was 15 percent. Based upon your conversations that you've had today with the Prime Minister, [[09:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33543.4s)]
*  do you see that tariff rate coming down from what you proposed just a few weeks ago? [[09:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33551.4s)]
*  Well, they have a great fund of two trillion dollars. It's a big fund, and they don't have any debt, [[09:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33557.4s)]
*  so I think they'd probably be willing to pay us more than that, I hope. [[09:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33564.4s)]
*  Are the two nations in agreement on which countries... [[09:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33568.4s)]
*  Mr. President, in 2018, your former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called for an end to Russian occupation of Crimea. [[09:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33571.4s)]
*  Why does this administration, why has this administration changed its stance on territorial concessions? [[09:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33578.4s)]
*  Well, the war started. It would have never started if I were president. This is a war that is horrible. [[09:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33584.4s)]
*  All wars are horrible. This one is in particular bad, and I don't know that you can ever say there's going to be a winner to this [[09:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33591.4s)]
*  because so many lives have been lost. Not only soldiers. A lot of lives have been lost. [[09:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33599.4s)]
*  I think that we want to do one very simple thing. It would have never happened if I were president. [[09:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33605.4s)]
*  Zero chance it was going to happen. And it didn't. You know, people say, how do you know that? [[09:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33612.4s)]
*  Number one, it didn't happen. We never even discussed it. [[09:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33616.4s)]
*  I would talk to Putin about it. It was the apple of his eye. Ukraine was the apple of Putin's eye, but we never, there was never even a thought that he'd go in. [[09:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33619.4s)]
*  And I think he understood that I would not be happy if he did. And it was only when I got out, and you know, when you mentioned what happened to Ukraine [[09:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33628.4s)]
*  years ago under President Obama and a vice president that was also president later, unfortunately, for this country. [[09:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33638.4s)]
*  What happened is large chunks of lead were given up and it was called Crimea. And that was a big, that was a big thing. That was a big moment. [[09:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33646.4s)]
*  But this isn't my war. This is Biden's war. This is a war that Biden was president when this war happened. [[09:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33656.4s)]
*  But I'm trying to put out the fire and I think we'll be successful. And if we do, we're going to save a lot of lives otherwise. [[09:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33665.4s)]
*  And the prime minister had a statement. He said, this is just a point in time. We're very lucky because this is a point. [[09:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33671.4s)]
*  And if this doesn't happen, this could go on for a long time. [[09:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33678.4s)]
*  Mr. President, will you have, will you have meetings with other world leaders in here and around the world, sir? [[09:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33682.4s)]
*  I don't think he will. I think he wants to make peace. I think he wants to end it. And I feel pretty confident of that. [[09:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33686.4s)]
*  But we're going to, we're going to know pretty soon. [[09:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33696.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I think you are the 21st state president. [[09:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33698.4s)]
*  Will you have meetings with other world leaders when you're in Rome? [[09:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33702.4s)]
*  Yes, I will. [[09:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33704.4s)]
*  Which leaders do you want to meet, sir? [[09:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33705.4s)]
*  Well, I'd like to meet them all. That would be nice. I'd like to take care of all of them. [[09:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33707.4s)]
*  But we have many of them there and they all want to meet. They want to meet about trade. [[09:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33712.4s)]
*  And we are making some great inroads and great deals. You might want to speak about that, Mr. Secretary. [[09:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33717.4s)]
*  We had a very successful bilateral meeting with the Republic of South Korea today. [[09:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33723.4s)]
*  We may be moving faster than I thought. [[09:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33728.4s)]
*  And we will be talking technical terms as early as next week, as we reach an agreement on understanding as soon as next week. [[09:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33732.4s)]
*  So South Koreans came early. They came with their A game. And we will see if they follow through on that. [[09:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33741.4s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think you deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if you manage to create it? [[09:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33748.4s)]
*  Who I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize? [[09:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33755.4s)]
*  If you manage to create it. [[09:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33757.4s)]
*  Well, maybe for the Abraham Accords. I don't want to get ahead of myself on this one, but they say for the Abraham Accords. [[09:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33758.4s)]
*  And by the way, speaking of that, we're going to be filling it up. A lot of countries want to come into the Abraham Accords. [[09:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33765.4s)]
*  You know, we have four and Biden did nothing on that one, too. It's the same four. [[09:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33770.4s)]
*  But they're great countries and they were brave doing it. And it's worked out very well. [[09:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33776.4s)]
*  And we're going to be filling up the Abraham Accords. You're going to be, I think, filling it up very rapidly. [[09:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33780.4s)]
*  Mr. President, could you say something about that? [[09:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33786.4s)]
*  There's great enormous opportunity to grow the Abraham Accords. [[09:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33789.4s)]
*  But I would just point to one thing. Of all the leaders in the world today, no leader is working harder to prevent wars or end them than President Trump is right now. [[09:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33792.4s)]
*  That's why we're talking to Iran. That's why we're engaged with Ukraine and Russia. [[09:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33800.4s)]
*  It's the desire to prevent these wars from breaking out and to end the ones that exist already. [[09:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33804.4s)]
*  And again, I just think it's tremendous for our country to be led by a president who desires to bring peace and establish peace and protect peace. [[09:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33808.4s)]
*  So it's hard work. [[09:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33816.4s)]
*  You know, Marco just mentioned something that maybe we should talk about for just a second and we could, Mr. Prime Minister. [[09:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33819.4s)]
*  And you're involved in it, too, because you've been involved in the world and peace. [[09:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33828.4s)]
*  But I think we're doing very well with respect to Iran and we're having very serious meetings. [[09:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33832.4s)]
*  And there are only two options. And the one option is not a good option. [[09:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33839.4s)]
*  It's not a not a good option at all. [[09:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33845.4s)]
*  And I think we're doing very well on an agreement with Iran. [[09:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33848.4s)]
*  But that one we're doing a lot of things, I will say. [[09:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33853.4s)]
*  But that one is well in its way. [[09:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33856.4s)]
*  We could have a very, very good decision and a lot of lives will be saved. [[09:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33860.4s)]
*  Mr. President, on the economy, there was a slowdown as it relates to home sales in the month of March, the slowest pace since 2009. [[09:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33864.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator? [[09:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33875.4s)]
*  And perhaps the Treasury Secretary can weigh in on this as well. [[09:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33877.4s)]
*  Is that an economic indicator that concerns you about the broader U.S.U.S. ? [[09:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33880.4s)]
*  No, they had very good numbers on housing today, extremely good numbers. [[09:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33884.4s)]
*  And that's despite interest rates, because, you know, if you look at what happened, everyone said, oh, I said I was going to get prices down. [[09:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33888.4s)]
*  I did. Energy just hit one dollar and 98 cents in a couple of states. [[09:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33895.4s)]
*  It's way down. Energy is down. [[09:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33899.4s)]
*  And we're about sixty four dollars a barrel. [[09:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33901.4s)]
*  When I came in and we were looking at eighty nine, ninety, ninety five dollars. [[09:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33904.4s)]
*  And by the way, that helps us solve the war, too. [[09:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33908.4s)]
*  Having those energy prices is a big a big incentive for Russia to also agree with solving the war problem. [[09:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33911.4s)]
*  Groceries are down. [[09:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33919.4s)]
*  When I was with you two months ago, you were you were complaining about eggs. [[09:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33921.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I've been here for I was here for about a week when the when the press started saying about eggs have gone through the roof. [[09:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33926.4s)]
*  I said, I just got here. Tell me about eggs. [[09:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33933.4s)]
*  And they happened. They were they went through the roof and you couldn't get them. [[09:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33935.4s)]
*  So we just had a big Easter egg hunt at the White House. [[09:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33939.4s)]
*  Thousands and thousands of eggs. [[09:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33943.4s)]
*  And the price was down eighty seven percent. [[09:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33945.4s)]
*  So we did a great job. [[09:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33948.4s)]
*  Housing is doing very well. [[09:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33950.4s)]
*  We should lower interest rates. That's the Fed. [[09:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33952.4s)]
*  I hope they lower interest rates. That's the smart thing to do. [[09:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33955.4s)]
*  Be ahead a little bit, although already it's a little bit late. [[09:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33958.4s)]
*  But in the end, we just have a great country, a very strong country. [[09:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33961.4s)]
*  And we have every other country. [[09:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33965.4s)]
*  We have one country that doesn't want to negotiate a deal. [[09:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33967.4s)]
*  And they either negotiate a deal or we set a deal that we think is fair because we don't have to go through all of these. [[09:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33970.4s)]
*  It would be physically impossible. [[09:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33978.4s)]
*  You know, you have so many people that really understand it, which is a very small group of people here. [[09:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33980.4s)]
*  And we are going to at some point just set prices for deals. [[09:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33985.4s)]
*  Some will be tariffed. [[09:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33991.4s)]
*  Some treated us very unfairly. [[09:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33993.4s)]
*  They'll be tariffed higher than others. [[09:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33995.4s)]
*  But we've been ripped off for many, many years. [[09:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33997.4s)]
*  The United States has been ripped off like no country probably in the history of the world has been ripped off for 45, 50 years. [[09:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=33999.4s)]
*  And countries have gone rich by doing that with the United States. [[09:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34006.4s)]
*  We've taken care of their militaries. [[09:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34011.4s)]
*  And militaries is another subject we talk about. [[09:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34013.4s)]
*  We're not going to make that subject to any of the deals. [[09:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34015.4s)]
*  But, you know, you know the same countries that I do where we virtually take care of their military and then don't get treated fairly. [[09:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34018.4s)]
*  So the people and I don't blame those countries. [[09:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34024.4s)]
*  I blame the people that sat at that beautiful desk right behind you because those people didn't do the job for this country. [[09:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34028.4s)]
*  And they let us lose $4 billion a day on trade. [[09:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34036.4s)]
*  We were losing $4 or $5 billion a day on trade when I got here. [[09:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34041.4s)]
*  And now we're going to be much better than breaking even. [[09:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34045.4s)]
*  And we're going to be making $4 or $5 billion a day on trade. [[09:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34049.4s)]
*  So, but the I don't blame any country. [[09:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34053.4s)]
*  Not the worst of them. [[09:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34057.4s)]
*  And we were abused by countries. [[09:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34058.4s)]
*  I blame the president of the United States that happened to be sitting where these deals were made. [[09:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34060.4s)]
*  Disgraceful. [[09:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34066.4s)]
*  When I was here, we had a great four years. [[09:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34067.4s)]
*  We had the most successful economy in the history of our country my first term. [[09:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34069.4s)]
*  And we were very tough on trade. [[09:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34073.4s)]
*  And with China, as you know, they paid hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. [[09:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34075.4s)]
*  But nobody else ever did that. [[09:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34080.4s)]
*  China paid not 10 cents to any other president. [[09:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34081.4s)]
*  And they, but not only China, virtually every country got away with murder. [[09:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34084.4s)]
*  And we just can't let that happen. [[09:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34091.4s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[09:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34093.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34096.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[09:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34097.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34098.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34104.4s)]
*  We have Jonas Garsturus here, who is the, as you know, the prime minister of Norway. [[09:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34105.4s)]
*  He's a great gentleman, highly respected, beloved in his country. [[09:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34111.4s)]
*  And we've had talks on the war with Ukraine, Russia, and trade. [[09:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34116.4s)]
*  Doing very well, I think, on both. [[09:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34124.4s)]
*  We've had some pretty good movement. [[09:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34126.4s)]
*  And every respect to war is very important. [[09:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34129.4s)]
*  It's very important that it ends with, I used to say, 2,500 people a week, dying, young people, [[09:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34131.4s)]
*  mostly soldiers from Russia and Ukraine. [[09:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34138.4s)]
*  And we want to end that war. [[09:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34142.4s)]
*  We want to end it quickly. [[09:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34146.4s)]
*  And I think we've made a lot of progress. [[09:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34148.4s)]
*  And we'll see what happens. [[09:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34150.4s)]
*  This next few days is going to be very important. [[09:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34152.4s)]
*  Meetings are taking place right now. [[09:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34154.4s)]
*  Additionally, we talked about trade, and we will definitely, we get along very well on trade. [[09:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34157.4s)]
*  We'll do something. [[09:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34165.4s)]
*  But I think the prime minister knows that over the years, the United States has been very good to a lot of people. [[09:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34167.4s)]
*  And it's time for us to benefit also. [[09:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34174.4s)]
*  So we're going to have a good relationship on trade. [[09:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34179.4s)]
*  And we discussed other things also. [[09:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34181.4s)]
*  But, Mr. Prime Minister, it's an honor to have you with us. [[09:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34184.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34188.4s)]
*  Well, thank you, Mr. President. [[09:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34190.4s)]
*  This year is 200 years since the first immigration from Norway to the U.S. [[09:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34192.4s)]
*  We come here early in your term. [[09:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34197.4s)]
*  Appreciate that you take time. [[09:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34199.4s)]
*  We have highlighted that very close cooperation. [[09:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34201.4s)]
*  We are allies. [[09:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34203.4s)]
*  We look after security in the North, in the Arctic. [[09:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34205.4s)]
*  A lot of confidence between our services. [[09:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34208.4s)]
*  We have discussed in detail the war in Ukraine. [[09:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34211.4s)]
*  I have saluted the president for his initiative to make progress towards something that can be a ceasefire and an end to this terrible conflict. [[09:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34215.4s)]
*  It is a complex picture, but it needs political will and push. [[09:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34224.4s)]
*  And we have exchanged ideas on that. [[09:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34228.4s)]
*  And then I think the president and his team have been open to hear our perspectives and on trade. [[09:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34230.4s)]
*  We have also emphasized that we can benefit both of us by trading. [[09:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34237.4s)]
*  We can be complementary. [[09:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34243.4s)]
*  And we can find good solutions. [[09:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34245.4s)]
*  But first of all, I appreciate, Mr. President, the spirit and the tone of this conversation, which has been confirmation of a very strong partnership. [[09:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34247.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[09:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34255.4s)]
*  Any questions? [[09:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34258.4s)]
*  Mr. President, have you spoken about the tariffs that you want to impose on Norway? [[09:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34260.4s)]
*  Is there a chance that you could lower the tariffs? [[09:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34267.4s)]
*  We spoke about trade, and we understand each other very well. [[09:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34269.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem. [[09:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34272.4s)]
*  Do you think that you can get an agreement with Norway? [[09:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34274.4s)]
*  I think we'll have no problem whatsoever with Norway. [[09:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34276.4s)]
*  Mr. President, did you discuss a possible visit to Norway? [[09:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34278.4s)]
*  Did you too discuss a possible visit to President Trump's Norway? [[09:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34282.4s)]
*  We didn't, but I would. I love it. [[09:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34284.4s)]
*  I've been there, and it is a beautiful place. [[09:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34286.4s)]
*  I told the President that he is receiving us early in the term. [[09:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34290.4s)]
*  He is welcome to visit Norway. [[09:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34294.4s)]
*  We would like to have him. [[09:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34296.4s)]
*  And it will be another way of emphasizing this strong friendship. [[09:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34298.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Norway has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022. [[09:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34302.4s)]
*  Has something been discussed here today that may have altered your views on things? [[09:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34312.4s)]
*  No, we want to, very simply. [[09:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34318.4s)]
*  I have no allegiance to anybody. I have allegiance to saving lives. [[09:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34320.4s)]
*  And I want to save a lot of lives. [[09:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34325.4s)]
*  A lot of young people's, mostly young people. [[09:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34327.4s)]
*  It's the war. It's the soldiers. [[09:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34329.4s)]
*  And if we can do that, also, as you know, I got started because the money that's been spent on this war is insane. [[09:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34331.4s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[09:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34339.4s)]
*  And it would have never happened if I were President. [[09:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34341.4s)]
*  But Biden spent $350 billion on this, and it's a shame. [[09:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34343.4s)]
*  And that's what got me involved. [[09:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34350.4s)]
*  And then I looked at, and I see the results. It's horrible. [[09:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34352.4s)]
*  It's a killing field. [[09:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34356.4s)]
*  5,000 soldiers a week on average. [[09:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34358.4s)]
*  And we want to stop that. We both want to stop that. [[09:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34362.4s)]
*  For a lot of reasons, but I would say that is my number one reason. [[09:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34365.4s)]
*  Do you think that you will get Russia to accept the deal that also Ukraine and Europe will accept? [[09:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34370.4s)]
*  I think so, yeah. I do. I believe they will accept. [[09:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34379.4s)]
*  And I think we're going to get this over with, I hope so, soon. [[09:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34382.4s)]
*  Mr. President, you continue to lack support from NATO allies in your goal of obtaining Greenland. [[09:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34385.4s)]
*  How will you proceed if you don't get that support? [[09:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34393.4s)]
*  Well, Greenland is going to be interesting, but that's for another day. [[09:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34396.4s)]
*  I think we need that for international peace. [[09:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34399.4s)]
*  What are you expecting from your allies? [[09:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34401.4s)]
*  And if you don't have that, I think it's a big threat to our world. [[09:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34402.4s)]
*  So I think Greenland is very important for international peace. [[09:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34406.4s)]
*  Here, please, go ahead. [[09:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34409.4s)]
*  Mr. President, this morning in a social post, you used the words, Vladimir, stop. [[09:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34410.4s)]
*  That seemed like a slightly different message, a personal message. [[09:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34415.4s)]
*  What is your level of frustration with President Putin? [[09:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34419.4s)]
*  I didn't like last night. I wasn't happy with it. [[09:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34422.4s)]
*  And we're in the midst of talking peace and missiles were fired. [[09:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34425.4s)]
*  And I was not happy with it. That's what I meant. [[09:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34429.4s)]
*  And that's what it's meant. [[09:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34433.4s)]
*  Mr. President, I'm glad you're not. [[09:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34435.4s)]
*  I assume that's what you mean. [[09:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34437.4s)]
*  Sorry. If the bombs keep falling, will you consider additional sanctions toward Russia? [[09:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34438.4s)]
*  Or what will you do if President Putin does not respond? [[09:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34443.4s)]
*  I'd rather answer that question in a week. I want to see if we can have a deal. [[09:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34446.4s)]
*  No reason to answer it now, but I won't be happy. Let me put it that way. [[09:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34449.4s)]
*  Things will happen. [[09:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34453.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why are you not putting more pressure on Russia? [[09:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bT3_OKk1zfk&t=34455.4s)]
