# Sen. Kennedy slams former Secy Yellen: ‘Dodged Congress, defied oversight', drawing $650 BN.....
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ)
*  Secretary Yellen did that. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=0.0s)]
*  She took the tune of $650 billion [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=2.0s)]
*  and she dodged congressional approval [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=6.88s)]
*  by coming for an amount just below the trigger for us to approve it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=10.0s)]
*  We gave money to Iran, to Russia, to China, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=15.84s)]
*  and we're putting up the money. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=24.16s)]
*  What are special drawing rights? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=26.64s)]
*  I'm not terribly familiar with special drawing rights. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=30.32s)]
*  You need to get familiar. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=32.64s)]
*  Special drawing right is when the IMF gets together [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=34.24s)]
*  and decides to declare a dividend to all of the countries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=38.08s)]
*  And it's really like a dividend. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  It's really a sheet of paper that says [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=44.96s)]
*  any country can take these dividends, a sheet of paper, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  and go redeem it for the currency of any other country. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=51.36s)]
*  And Secretary Yellen did that. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=56.48s)]
*  She took the tune of $650 billion [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  and she dodged congressional approval [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  by coming for an amount just below the trigger for us to approve it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=68.88s)]
*  We gave money to Iran, to Russia, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=76.24s)]
*  to China, and we're putting up the money. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=82.64s)]
*  Why aren't we doing that? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=85.92s)]
*  Are you asking me, sir? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=91.12s)]
*  Yeah, I completely agree, sir. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=91.92s)]
*  Well, I've got a bill to say that whenever the Treasury catches a wild hair [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=94.96s)]
*  and decides they want to give away American taxpayer money to Iran, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=101.44s)]
*  as Treasury Yellen did, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=105.92s)]
*  that she has to come to Congress for approval. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=108.08s)]
*  You'll support that, won't you? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  I look forward to looking into the legislation, sir. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=117.12s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=119.6s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=120.4s)]
*  I'm after the Chair, Senator Warner. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Q3nzQ5YeQ&t=121.36s)]
