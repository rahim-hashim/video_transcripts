# Canada election 2025 LIVE | Pierre Poilievre makes key policy announcement in Halifax
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek)
*  The deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=0.0s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, he's [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11.96s)]
*  promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17.56s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, Liberals will [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23.28s)]
*  add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29.6s)]
*  – more expensive food, homes and cars. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39.88s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  higher with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  decent life, just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=52.08s)]
*  Trudeau's economic adviser. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=59.16s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=61.56s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=65.44s)]
*  has published about how the future looks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=70.36s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=74.0s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=77.88s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=82.83999999999999s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=86.92s)]
*  trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=92.88s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=96.12s)]
*  through inheritance and not through hard work. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=101.46s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, that property [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=104.76s)]
*  ownership and, by extension, wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=111.84s)]
*  abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=118.12s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, more people may [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=121.6s)]
*  struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=127.5s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=132.14s)]
*  Even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=135.26s)]
*  be unaffordable and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=140.01999999999998s)]
*  and waterways without reference to regulations. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=145.45999999999998s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  for food on public lands. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=157.17999999999998s)]
*  This in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=159.94s)]
*  of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, but the trajectory we were on after the lost [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=168.54s)]
*  Liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=175.14s)]
*  costs. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=181.22s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=182.22s)]
*  need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint of higher costs, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=188.10000000000002s)]
*  of raging crime, of more despair. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=195.54000000000002s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=199.22s)]
*  those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=208.18s)]
*  conflict and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=213.46s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series how ugly they describe the future in this Government [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=218.42000000000002s)]
*  of Canada report. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=226.22s)]
*  They are not talking about 100 years from now, they are talking about 15 years down [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=227.22s)]
*  the road. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=233.10000000000002s)]
*  Many people in the crowd said what you are describing is Canada today. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=239.9s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=245.70000000000002s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=251.38s)]
*  health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=255.9s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=261.74s)]
*  the ability to buy a car either. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate or let's [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=269.42s)]
*  call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=276.78000000000003s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=282.54s)]
*  opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=287.94s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, they will face a [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=292.22s)]
*  $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=297.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=304.62s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=308.54s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=311.98s)]
*  vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=318.26000000000005s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=321.26s)]
*  of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=326.38s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, they will have to pay a fine of $20,000 [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=329.38s)]
*  per vehicle. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=340.38s)]
*  That's not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax that will be imposed on you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=343.38s)]
*  the buyer if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=351.02s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=357.02s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, where Canadian workers [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=364.02s)]
*  in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=370.02s)]
*  fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, people who spend too much of their [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=376.65999999999997s)]
*  adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=384.65999999999997s)]
*  Now make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=390.65999999999997s)]
*  autoworkers. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=395.94s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban on gas-powered [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=397.46s)]
*  vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=405.38s)]
*  be sold will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=411.26s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=421.29999999999995s)]
*  benefit. Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=428.38s)]
*  to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. No wonder [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=436.86s)]
*  Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=444.02000000000004s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=450.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=456.22s)]
*  Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. And that number [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=460.38000000000005s)]
*  comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=467.02000000000004s)]
*  colder than that. So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=473.72s)]
*  Don't get fooled. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it's hitting our [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=480.72s)]
*  workers in the automotive sector. Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=488.92s)]
*  this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost our economy [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=495.44000000000005s)]
*  $138 billion. We're talking about billions. And who will benefit? Tesla. And who will [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=502.44000000000005s)]
*  benefit then? Our people' planet. And you have to watch this. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=510.82000000000005s)]
*  This is our nation's power as we're running it for our neighbors. And something we missed [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=515.7s)]
*  in the beginning of our attempt to influence energy. Also, things are going off the rails. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=524.02s)]
*  And many people are worried about their lives, especially levels of transportation. Do you [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=529.48s)]
*  of their life, of their battery in the cold. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=536.48s)]
*  And this figure comes from studies that have been done [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=540.48s)]
*  between minus 7 and minus 15 degrees. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=544.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=550.48s)]
*  or another road in the great north of Canada [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=555.48s)]
*  where it's minus 25 degrees. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=559.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=562.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=566.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=569.48s)]
*  which he wrote just four years ago. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=571.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=574.48s)]
*  use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=576.48s)]
*  of our economy, such as explicit timetables, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=579.48s)]
*  to phase out internal combustion engines. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=581.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=585.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=587.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=590.48s)]
*  altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=594.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=600.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=603.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=605.48s)]
*  how they're going to meet these timelines, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=609.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=612.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=615.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=619.48s)]
*  on Canadian consumers, this at a time when our economy [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=622.48s)]
*  is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=626.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=630.48s)]
*  between affording a warm home or a working car. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=633.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=636.48s)]
*  can't afford their first vehicle. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=639.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=641.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=643.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=647.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=651.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=666.48s)]
*  and to make vehicles more affordable. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=670.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=673.48s)]
*  no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=676.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, I have nothing against electric cars. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=679.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=682.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=684.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=686.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=689.48s)]
*  would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=693.48s)]
*  on any vehicles made in Canada [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=696.48s)]
*  so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=699.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=702.48s)]
*  to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=706.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=709.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=711.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=716.48s)]
*  and you vote for a 20-year term in office. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=720.48s)]
*  You vote for a 20-year term in office. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=723.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=726.48s)]
*  and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=729.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=734.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=738.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=742.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=745.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=748.48s)]
*  and continue to back the auto sector. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=751.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=754.48s)]
*  that the government has made, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=757.48s)]
*  but we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=759.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=766.48s)]
*  and the other commitments the government has made, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=770.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=774.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=776.48s)]
*  and we will go even further with powerful incentives [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=779.48s)]
*  for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=782.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=785.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will remove the tax on vehicles [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=788.48s)]
*  from its first day in office. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=792.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=795.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on gasoline cars is over. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=797.48s)]
*  The permanent restrictions on the cars you like and depend on are over. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=801.48s)]
*  Let me make it clear that if people want an electric car, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=808.48s)]
*  they should be able to choose it. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=812.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=814.48s)]
*  but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=818.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=822.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=824.48s)]
*  I will end the war against automobiles, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=829.48s)]
*  the Liberals and the Bloc. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=832.48s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=835.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=838.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=844.48s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=850.48s)]
*  in electric cars and a tramway. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=855.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=859.48s)]
*  who simply want a tramway, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=863.48s)]
*  or the Conservatives who prefer a third link. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=866.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=870.48s)]
*  regarding the construction of electric vehicle factories [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=872.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=876.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=879.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=882.48s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=886.48s)]
*  We will make sure that the government gives you choice [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=890.48s)]
*  instead of hoarding control for itself. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=893.48s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=896.48s)]
*  no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=899.48s)]
*  We will not stop there. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=902.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=904.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=907.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=911.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=914.48s)]
*  and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=918.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=921.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=925.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=930.48s)]
*  to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=933.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=936.48s)]
*  built over the next half decade. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=940.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=943.48s)]
*  and homes for deserving families. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=946.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=949.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=952.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=954.48s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=958.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=961.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=967.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=971.48s)]
*  by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=974.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=979.48s)]
*  so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=981.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=985.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=989.48s)]
*  housing bills and now automobile bills. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=994.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=997.48s)]
*  on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1000.48s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1003.48s)]
*  in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1008.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1013.48s)]
*  Now let's bring it home. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1016.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1018.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1020.48s)]
*  Thank you both. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1022.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1024.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1028.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1031.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1036.48s)]
*  for the last number of years have been telling us [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1039.48s)]
*  how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1041.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1044.48s)]
*  not just the supporters that they have. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1047.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1049.48s)]
*  to face the challenges that are in our future? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1051.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1056.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1059.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1065.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1068.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1070.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1073.48s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1078.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1082.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1085.48s)]
*  your family's been here for six generations, or if you've been here for six weeks. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1087.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1091.48s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1095.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1099.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1105.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1108.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1110.48s)]
*  to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1112.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1115.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1117.48s)]
*  has that same opportunity. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1122.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1123.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1128.48s)]
*  and let's bring home change for the future. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1132.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1134.48s)]
*  Al-Khansi. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1136.48s)]
*  I should say that the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1142.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1146.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1150.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1153.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1156.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian, get out and exercise your democratic right. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1160.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1164.48s)]
*  Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1165.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate that you love. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1167.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1169.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1171.48s)]
*  the promise of Canada, that everyone who works hard [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1176.48s)]
*  should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1179.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1184.48s)]
*  you should be able to work hard to realize your dreams. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1188.48s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1193.48s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1198.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1204.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1207.48s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1209.48s)]
*  that will unite Canadians around this promise [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1212.48s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1216.48s)]
*  to make change. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1220.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1221.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1222.48s)]
*  Next question. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1223.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1224.48s)]
*  Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1225.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1227.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1229.48s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1231.48s)]
*  regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1233.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1236.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1237.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1241.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1243.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1245.48s)]
*  that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1250.48s)]
*  in Nova Scotia and never leave, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1254.48s)]
*  which it's an incredible honour to be back. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1256.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1260.48s)]
*  They want change. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1263.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1264.48s)]
*  Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1266.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1270.48s)]
*  than in any other city in the country. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1273.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1276.48s)]
*  is raging out of control, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1279.48s)]
*  and we can't afford a fourth Liberal term [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1281.48s)]
*  of rising costs and crime. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1285.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1287.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1290.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1293.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1295.48s)]
*  That is our mission, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1297.48s)]
*  and we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1299.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1302.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1305.48s)]
*  by lowering income tax by 15%. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1309.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1312.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1315.48s)]
*  to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1317.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1320.48s)]
*  that a bright future and a wonderful change [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1325.48s)]
*  is just around the corner. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1328.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1330.48s)]
*  you will get that change. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1332.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1334.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1335.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1336.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1337.48s)]
*  Good thinking. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1338.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1345.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1346.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1347.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1354.48s)]
*  I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1356.48s)]
*  People need change. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1359.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1362.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1368.48s)]
*  than in the United States in the last five years. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1373.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1377.48s)]
*  more than in any other city across Canada. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1380.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1384.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal destiny, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1387.48s)]
*  costs and crime are increasing. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1389.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1392.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1394.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1396.48s)]
*  that will cut gas taxes, cut tax aid, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1400.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1404.48s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and secure life. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1410.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1415.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1418.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1419.48s)]
*  Next question. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1420.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1423.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1424.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1425.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1426.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1427.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1430.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1433.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1437.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1442.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1446.48s)]
*  on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1450.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1453.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1456.48s)]
*  of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1460.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1464.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1469.48s)]
*  and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1472.48s)]
*  how are they going to get to work? [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1475.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1477.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1479.48s)]
*  when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1481.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1485.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1490.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1493.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1497.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1501.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1505.48s)]
*  Here you have a choice. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1511.48s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1514.48s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1516.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1522.48s)]
*  that is made in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1527.48s)]
*  for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1531.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1534.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1536.48s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1538.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1540.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1543.48s)]
*  In French? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1545.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1549.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1552.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1559.48s)]
*  It is irresponsible for Mr. Carney, during a tariff war, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1562.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered and diesel cars. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1567.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1575.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who cannot pay. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1582.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1588.48s)]
*  when they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1594.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1600.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1604.48s)]
*  On the contrary, the Conservatives will end the tax [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1606.48s)]
*  that the Liberals propose, and we will do otherwise. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1611.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1616.48s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1621.48s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1626.48s)]
*  for gasoline cars. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1630.48s)]
*  With the Conservatives, you will pay less, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1632.48s)]
*  no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1636.48s)]
*  That is the choice. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1643.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which will increase prices for everything, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1645.48s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives, which will cut gas prices, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1649.48s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1653.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1656.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1658.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1659.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1662.48s)]
*  Hello. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1663.48s)]
*  Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1664.48s)]
*  Hello. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1665.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1666.48s)]
*  about the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1668.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had said that Trump had respected [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1671.48s)]
*  Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1675.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1677.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1682.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1684.48s)]
*  It is clear that Mr. Carney must explain this. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1686.48s)]
*  I was not on the call, but I will say that Canada [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1690.48s)]
*  would never be an American state. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1693.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1696.48s)]
*  And that means focusing on what we can control. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1699.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1705.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1707.48s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1712.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1717.48s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investments to the United States. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1721.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1726.48s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1729.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1734.48s)]
*  this dependence because after a decade of loss [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1738.48s)]
*  of the Liberals who increased the cost and made our economy [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1742.48s)]
*  fall apart, we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1748.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1754.48s)]
*  that will cut gas, taxes, bureaucracy and taxes. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1758.48s)]
*  We must free the production of our resources and the construction [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1762.48s)]
*  of our homes and bring our jobs back here to keep Americans [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1766.48s)]
*  in control with force. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1770.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1774.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1776.48s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1777.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1779.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1780.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1781.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1782.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1783.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1785.48s)]
*  But what's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1786.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1788.48s)]
*  I'm going to start with the first one, which is to reverse [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1790.48s)]
*  the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1792.48s)]
*  advised Justin Trudeau to take, which have driven up the cost [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1795.48s)]
*  of living and driven our jobs south. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1798.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1801.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1805.48s)]
*  the cost of living. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1810.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1812.48s)]
*  and bringing Canadian resources to bring back the half-trillion [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1818.48s)]
*  dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1822.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1825.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1829.48s)]
*  and energy so that we can unleash production and powerful [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1835.48s)]
*  paychecks and stand up for our country from a position [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1839.48s)]
*  of strength for a change. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1842.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1844.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1845.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1847.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government that will [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1850.48s)]
*  reduce taxes and taxes, build housing, free our natural resources [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1854.48s)]
*  so that we can rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1860.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1867.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1871.48s)]
*  Change. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1874.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1875.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1877.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1879.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1882.48s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1887.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1890.48s)]
*  We need change. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1894.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1896.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1899.48s)]
*  We have, is Rick Perkins here? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1903.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1905.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1906.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1907.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1908.48s)]
*  Dr. Ellis is here. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1916.48s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1918.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1919.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris D'Avdaman. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1926.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1931.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost Liberal decade, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1935.48s)]
*  we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1938.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1941.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1943.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1945.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1949.48s)]
*  from a position of strength. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1952.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1954.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1955.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1961.48s)]
*  we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1966.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1970.48s)]
*  and develop our resources. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1973.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1975.48s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1981.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1983.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1988.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=1994.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2000.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2004.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes and cars. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2007.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2011.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2015.48s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2018.48s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2022.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2025.48s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2030.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2033.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2038.48s)]
*  that the government has published about how the future looks. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2042.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2046.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2050.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2055.48s)]
*  it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2059.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2064.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2068.48s)]
*  to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2073.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2077.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2083.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2089.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2093.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2098.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country, and even more so, and more shockingly so, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2103.48s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2109.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2114.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2118.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2121.48s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2125.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2131.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2137.48s)]
*  but the trajectory we're on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2143.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2150.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2154.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2159.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2166.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2171.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2179.48s)]
*  a driver of social, economic and political conflict, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2183.48s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2186.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2190.48s)]
*  in this Government of Canada report. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2197.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2199.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2204.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2208.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2211.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2217.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2222.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2227.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2232.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2236.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2240.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2246.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2253.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2259.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2264.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2269.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2277.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2280.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2284.48s)]
*  if the Liberals are re-elected. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2291.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2293.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered cars. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2298.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2302.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2308.48s)]
*  It's not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2315.48s)]
*  the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2323.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2329.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2336.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2340.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2345.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2353.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2362.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2368.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2377.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2383.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2392.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2399.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2409.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2415.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2422.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2427.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2430.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2438.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2443.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2447.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to our workers in the automotive sector. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2453.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2463.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. We're talking about billions. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2473.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. Foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2480.48s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2486.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, or another route in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2522.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2534.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2541.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2546.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2551.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2557.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2562.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2573.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2578.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2585.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2588.48s)]
*  We're at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2597.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2603.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2609.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2614.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2620.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2627.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2646.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2652.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2657.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2659.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2662.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2667.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2683.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2690.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2697.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2706.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2710.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2714.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2720.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2726.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2731.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2738.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2746.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2751.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2758.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2768.48s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on the cars you like and don't depend on are over. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2773.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2780.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2786.48s)]
*  But we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2790.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2797.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2801.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2807.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2811.48s)]
*  They need a diesel-powered car. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2817.48s)]
*  We will support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2822.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2831.48s)]
*  or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2838.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicle factories [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2842.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2848.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2851.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2855.48s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2859.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2863.48s)]
*  No more carney tax. No more carney quotas. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2868.48s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2871.48s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2874.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2876.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2879.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2884.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2887.48s)]
*  and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2890.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2894.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2898.48s)]
*  And we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2903.48s)]
*  by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2907.48s)]
*  built over the next half decade. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2912.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2915.48s)]
*  and homes for deserving families. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2919.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2922.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2925.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2927.48s)]
*  are we going to elect the Liberals for a fourth term [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2931.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2934.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2940.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2944.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2949.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2952.48s)]
*  in a position of strength? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2956.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2958.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2962.48s)]
*  housing bills and now automobile bills. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2967.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2970.48s)]
*  on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2973.48s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2976.48s)]
*  in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2981.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2987.48s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2989.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2991.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2993.48s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2995.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=2997.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3002.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3005.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders, for the last number of weeks, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3009.48s)]
*  for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3012.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3015.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3017.48s)]
*  not just the supporters that they have. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3020.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3022.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3029.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3032.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3038.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3041.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3043.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3046.48s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3050.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3055.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3058.48s)]
*  or if you've been here for six weeks. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3062.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3064.48s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3067.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3072.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3078.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3080.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3082.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3087.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3089.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3096.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3101.48s)]
*  and let's bring home change for the future. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3105.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3107.48s)]
*  Al-Fansi. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3109.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3110.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3115.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3119.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3123.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3125.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3129.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3133.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3137.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3141.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3143.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise, the promise of Canada, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3145.48s)]
*  that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a nice house on a safe street. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3150.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3158.48s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3166.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost liberals, people have lost hope. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3171.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3177.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3180.48s)]
*  We need change. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3182.48s)]
*  We need change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3183.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make changes. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3189.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3194.48s)]
*  Next question. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3195.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3196.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3199.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3201.48s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3203.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3208.48s)]
*  It's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3210.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3213.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3215.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3223.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3231.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3234.48s)]
*  They want change. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3237.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3238.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3244.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3250.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3254.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3260.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3264.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3266.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3268.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3270.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3272.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3275.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3278.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3285.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3288.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3293.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3299.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3302.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3306.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3308.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3309.48s)]
*  In French. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3310.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3318.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3319.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3321.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3327.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3329.48s)]
*  People need change. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3332.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3335.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3340.48s)]
*  in the last five years. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3347.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3349.48s)]
*  across Canada. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3355.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3357.48s)]
*  After the lost destiny of the Liberals, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3360.48s)]
*  costs and crime are increasing. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3362.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3365.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3367.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3369.48s)]
*  that will cut gas taxes, cut tax and tax, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3373.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3377.48s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3383.48s)]
*  That's the message for Nova Scotians. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3388.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3391.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3392.48s)]
*  Next question. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3393.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3395.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3397.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3399.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3403.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3406.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3409.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3414.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3418.48s)]
*  on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3422.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3426.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3429.48s)]
*  of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3433.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3436.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3442.48s)]
*  and they can't afford a new car, [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3444.48s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3446.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3448.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3450.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3452.48s)]
*  when there's a new tax, Liberal tax, on vehicles? [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3454.48s)]
*  I will axe that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3458.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3463.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3466.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3470.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3474.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3478.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3482.48s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3486.48s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3489.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3495.48s)]
*  that is made in Canada, [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3500.48s)]
*  and you vote that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3502.48s)]
*  and strengthening our economy. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3506.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3508.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3510.48s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3512.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3514.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3517.48s)]
*  In French. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3519.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3521.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3525.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3531.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3535.48s)]
*  during a tariff war, to propose a tax of $20,000 [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3538.48s)]
*  for gas-powered cars and diesel engines. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3544.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3547.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3554.48s)]
*  for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3557.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3560.48s)]
*  when they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3566.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3573.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3577.48s)]
*  On the contrary, the Conservatives will end [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3579.48s)]
*  the tax on motorists proposed by the Liberals. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3582.48s)]
*  And we will do otherwise. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3586.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3589.48s)]
*  to promote domestic production [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3593.48s)]
*  and bring jobs here in Canada. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3596.48s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3598.48s)]
*  you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3600.48s)]
*  With the Conservatives, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3604.48s)]
*  you will pay less than a TPS [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3606.48s)]
*  on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3610.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3615.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3617.48s)]
*  that will increase prices for everything, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3619.48s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3621.48s)]
*  that will cut waste, reduce taxes [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3624.48s)]
*  and make life more affordable. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3627.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3629.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3631.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3632.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3634.48s)]
*  Hello. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3637.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3638.48s)]
*  spoke about the 51st method [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3640.48s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3642.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister told us [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3644.48s)]
*  that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3646.48s)]
*  during their discussion. [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3649.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3650.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3654.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3656.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3658.48s)]
*  I wasn't there, but I will say that Canada [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3662.48s)]
*  would never be an American state. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3666.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3668.48s)]
*  That means we must focus on what we can control. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3671.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3676.48s)]
*  We can reverse the disastrous liberal policies [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3679.48s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3685.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3689.48s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3693.48s)]
*  The policies that blocked our natural resources [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3698.48s)]
*  and gave our oil to Americans at low prices. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3701.48s)]
*  We must reverse all liberal policies [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3705.48s)]
*  that caused this dependence. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3710.48s)]
*  Because after a decade lost, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3712.48s)]
*  we can't pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3715.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3719.48s)]
*  that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3724.48s)]
*  free the production of our resources [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3728.48s)]
*  and the construction of homes, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3731.48s)]
*  and bring our jobs back here [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3733.48s)]
*  to keep Americans in control. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3735.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3739.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3741.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3743.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3745.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3747.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3748.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3751.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3753.48s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3755.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3758.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3761.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3763.48s)]
*  I want to talk about the liberal economic policies [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3765.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3767.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3769.48s)]
*  and driven our jobs south. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3771.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3773.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3777.48s)]
*  and bringing down the cost of living. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3781.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3783.48s)]
*  and Canadian resources [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3790.48s)]
*  to bring back the half trillion dollars [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3792.48s)]
*  that liberals pushed south. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3794.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3796.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3801.48s)]
*  home building and energy [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3806.48s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3809.48s)]
*  and stand up for our country [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3812.48s)]
*  from a position of strength for a change. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3814.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3816.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3818.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3820.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3823.48s)]
*  that will reduce taxes and taxes, [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3827.48s)]
*  build homes, free our natural resources [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3830.48s)]
*  so that we can rebuild our economic strength [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3833.48s)]
*  to make change. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3838.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3840.48s)]
*  in this change election. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3842.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3844.48s)]
*  Change. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3847.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3848.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3850.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3852.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3855.48s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3860.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3863.48s)]
*  We need change. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3867.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3869.48s)]
*  Today, we're here with our incredible team [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3872.48s)]

*  APPLAUSE [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3893.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3895.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3898.48s)]
*  and Chris Dalgamon. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3901.48s)]
*  APPLAUSE [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3903.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3905.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3908.48s)]
*  we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3911.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3914.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3916.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3918.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3922.48s)]
*  from a position of strength, again, for a change. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3925.48s)]
*  Over the last four... over the next four years, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3928.48s)]
*  my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3931.48s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy. [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3934.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3939.48s)]
*  and we're going to unleash our economy [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3943.48s)]
*  to build more homes and develop our resources. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3945.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is to drive... [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3948.48s)]
*  is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3952.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3956.48s)]
*  that Trudeau had budgeted, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3959.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3961.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3967.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3973.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3977.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes and cars. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3980.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3984.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3987.48s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3990.48s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3994.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=3997.48s)]
*  when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4001.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4005.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4010.48s)]
*  but this incredible report that the government has published [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4012.48s)]
*  about how the future looks. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4016.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4018.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4022.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4027.48s)]
*  it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4032.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4036.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4040.48s)]
*  says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4043.48s)]
*  and not through hard work. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4047.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4049.48s)]
*  that the economy will shrink, [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4053.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4056.48s)]
*  may become even more concentrated [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4059.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4062.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4066.48s)]
*  that over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4069.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4076.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4079.48s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4082.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4087.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4091.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4094.48s)]
*  but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4097.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4104.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4110.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4116.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4123.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4127.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4132.48s)]
*  that a fourth Liberal term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4136.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4143.48s)]
*  will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4150.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4154.48s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4159.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4163.48s)]
*  how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4167.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4172.48s)]
*  they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4174.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4177.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4181.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4184.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4190.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4195.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4200.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4205.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4209.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4213.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4219.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4226.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4231.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4236.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4241.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4249.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4253.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4256.48s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4259.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4265.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered cars. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4270.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4274.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4281.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4288.48s)]
*  It's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4292.48s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4297.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4302.48s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4305.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4309.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4313.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4318.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4326.48s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4331.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4335.48s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4339.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4341.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4350.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4356.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4365.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4367.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4371.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4373.48s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4379.48s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4383.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4388.48s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4392.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4395.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4400.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4403.48s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4406.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4411.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4416.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4419.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4425.48s)]
*  And it hits directly on our workers in the automotive sector. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4431.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4436.48s)]
*  could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4441.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4446.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4451.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4453.48s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4456.48s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4459.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4495.48s)]
*  or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25 degrees. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4500.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4507.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4511.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4514.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4518.48s)]
*  Use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4520.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4524.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4529.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4532.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4535.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4541.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4545.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4548.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4550.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4557.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4560.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4564.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4569.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4576.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4582.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4587.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4589.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4593.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4605.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4612.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4618.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, I have nothing against electric cars. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4625.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4628.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4630.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4632.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4634.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4640.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4655.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4662.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4663.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4669.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4679.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4682.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4687.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4690.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4692.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4698.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4703.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4710.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4718.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4721.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4724.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4730.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4733.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4740.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on gasoline cars is over. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4742.48s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on your favorite cars are over. [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4746.48s)]
*  Be clear. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4752.48s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4754.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4759.48s)]
*  But we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4763.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4767.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4769.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the liberal and block cars. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4774.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4780.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4783.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4789.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and trams. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4795.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberal and block cars, [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4804.48s)]
*  which simply want a tram, or the Conservatives, which favor a third link. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4808.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4815.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4821.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4824.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4827.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4835.48s)]
*  No more carney tax. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4840.48s)]
*  No more carney quotas. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4842.48s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4844.48s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4847.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4848.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4851.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4859.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4866.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4870.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4875.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4881.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4888.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4895.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4898.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4900.48s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4903.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4912.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4922.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4924.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4930.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4934.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4943.48s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice affordable home on a safe street under our proud flag. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4949.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4959.48s)]
*  Now let's bring it home. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4962.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4964.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4966.48s)]
*  Thank you both for your time. [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4968.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4970.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4974.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4976.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4981.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4987.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=4994.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5001.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5003.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5010.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5013.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5015.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5017.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5027.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5030.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5036.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5044.48s)]
*  We are one country. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5050.48s)]
*  We're a proud country. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5051.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5053.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5054.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5060.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5062.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5068.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5073.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5079.48s)]
*  Al-Khansi. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5082.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5083.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5087.48s)]
*  We need change. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5092.48s)]
*  We need change now more than ever. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5093.48s)]
*  A change so that people have hope again. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5095.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5098.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5101.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5105.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5109.48s)]
*  Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5111.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5113.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give back. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5135.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5137.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5139.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back. [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5141.48s)]

*  I'm going to give back. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5161.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5163.48s)]
*  Next question. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5165.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polly. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5167.48s)]
*  Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5169.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5171.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5173.48s)]
*  And what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5175.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5179.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5181.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5185.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5187.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5189.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5199.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5201.48s)]
*  They want change. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5203.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5205.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more than ever. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5211.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5213.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5217.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5221.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5223.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5225.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5227.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5229.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5231.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5233.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5235.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5237.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5239.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5241.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5243.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5245.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5247.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5251.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5257.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5261.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5265.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5271.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5275.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5279.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5281.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5283.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5285.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5287.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5289.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5291.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province, and I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5293.48s)]
*  People need change. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5295.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5297.48s)]
*  The cost of food is very high. [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5299.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5301.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5303.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5305.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5307.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5309.48s)]
*  And we need to change. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5311.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5313.48s)]
*  in the last five years. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5319.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5321.48s)]
*  across Canada. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5327.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5329.48s)]
*  After the decade lost to the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5331.48s)]
*  it needs to change. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5337.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5339.48s)]
*  We need a real change. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5341.48s)]
*  With a new Conservative government that will cut the gas tax, cut tax aid, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5343.48s)]
*  free housing construction and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5349.48s)]
*  and safe life. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5357.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5359.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5363.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5365.48s)]
*  Next question. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5367.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5369.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5371.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5373.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5377.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5380.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5383.48s)]
*  Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5389.48s)]
*  gas-powered vehicles? [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5397.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5399.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5401.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5407.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5409.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5415.48s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5419.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5423.48s)]
*  How are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5425.48s)]
*  Liberal tax, on vehicles? [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5428.48s)]
*  I will axe that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5431.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5436.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5439.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5443.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5446.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5451.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5457.48s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5459.48s)]
*  on your gas-powered automobile. [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5464.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5467.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5474.48s)]
*  and strengthening our economy. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5478.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5480.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5481.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5485.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5488.48s)]
*  In French. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5490.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5494.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5497.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel. [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5507.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5519.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5526.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5533.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5545.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5549.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will end the tax on motor vehicles proposed by Liberals, [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5551.48s)]
*  and we'll do otherwise. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5559.48s)]
*  We'll eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic production [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5562.48s)]
*  and bring jobs here in Canada. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5569.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5571.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5577.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5588.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate from the Liberals will increase prices for everything, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5589.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives that will cut waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5594.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5601.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5603.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5604.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5607.48s)]
*  Hello. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5610.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken of the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5611.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussions. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5617.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5623.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5627.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5629.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5631.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada would never be an American state. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5635.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5641.48s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5644.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5649.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5652.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investments to the United States. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5662.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5671.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5678.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of the Liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5685.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5695.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5699.48s)]
*  Free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5707.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5712.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5729.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5732.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5734.48s)]
*  Which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5742.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5746.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5750.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5756.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5768.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5773.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5781.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5788.48s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5790.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5791.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, build homes, free our natural resources, [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5795.48s)]
*  and build our economic strength to make change. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5805.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5812.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5816.48s)]
*  Change. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5819.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5820.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5822.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5824.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5827.48s)]
*  We need change. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5839.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5841.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5844.48s)]
*  We have, is Rick Perkins here? [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5848.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5850.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5851.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5852.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5856.48s)]
*  Dr. Ellis is here. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5861.48s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5863.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5868.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Delcamo. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5871.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5877.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost Liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5880.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5885.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5887.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5889.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5893.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5898.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5900.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5912.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5915.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5920.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5928.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5934.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5940.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5946.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5953.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5956.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5960.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5965.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5970.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5978.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5983.48s)]
*  but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5985.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5990.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5994.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=5999.48s)]
*  it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6004.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6008.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6013.48s)]
*  and not through hard work. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6020.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6022.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6028.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6034.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6038.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6043.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6048.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6051.48s)]
*  and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6058.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6063.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scourge for food on public lands. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6066.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6076.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6082.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6088.48s)]
*  were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6093.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6099.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6104.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6111.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6116.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6124.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6131.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6135.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6144.48s)]
*  Now yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6149.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6157.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6162.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6168.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6172.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6178.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6186.48s)]
*  Or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6193.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas powered vehicles. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6199.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6209.48s)]
*  which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6219.48s)]
*  Now that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6222.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[01:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6225.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6228.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas powered cars. [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6237.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will have to pay a $20,000 per vehicle tax. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6246.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas powered or hybrid. [[01:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6260.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6274.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6281.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out of touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6286.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6299.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the auto workers. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6308.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban on gas powered vehicles [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6314.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6323.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6337.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6346.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6360.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6367.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6373.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6383.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6392.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6398.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6406.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6423.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6428.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6436.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6444.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6458.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[01:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6467.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6479.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6486.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables to phase out internal combustion engines. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6491.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6502.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6508.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6514.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6523.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[01:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6533.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6542.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6548.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6554.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6559.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6565.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6572.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6591.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6597.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6602.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6607.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6628.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6635.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6642.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[01:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6655.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6665.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6676.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, and we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing the GST on those purchases. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6693.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6706.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6713.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6725.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6742.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6752.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6767.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6776.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles, because we respect the contracts. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6787.48s)]
*  We will cut the liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive, and we won't stop there. We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6817.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6824.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6832.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6843.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6854.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6860.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6867.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect Liberals for a fourth term, with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6872.48s)]
*  Or do we want change, with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians, [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6885.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6896.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6902.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6906.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6915.48s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6923.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6931.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6937.48s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6940.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6943.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6950.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders, for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6954.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6960.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6967.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6974.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. [[01:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6977.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6986.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=6991.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7000.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7003.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7009.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[01:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7017.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7023.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7027.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7032.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7041.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7046.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, that the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7058.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7064.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. Something that has been lost these last few years. [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7068.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7074.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7078.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate you love. [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7082.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7087.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7090.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7094.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7103.48s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7111.48s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7116.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7122.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7125.48s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7127.48s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7134.48s)]
*  Next question. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7140.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7141.48s)]
*  During the final days of the campaign, what made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7144.48s)]
*  And what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7148.48s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7153.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7158.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7168.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7176.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7180.48s)]
*  They want change. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7183.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7184.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7190.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7195.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7200.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7206.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[02:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7209.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7212.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7214.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7216.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[02:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7217.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7220.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7224.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7230.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7233.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7238.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7248.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7252.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7253.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7254.48s)]
*  Good thinking. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7255.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7256.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7263.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7264.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7272.48s)]
*  And it's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7274.48s)]
*  People need change. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7277.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7280.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7285.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7294.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7302.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime are increasing. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7305.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7310.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7312.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, cut tax cuts, [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7314.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7322.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7333.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7336.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7337.48s)]
*  Next question. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7338.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7339.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7342.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7344.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7351.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7354.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7371.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7374.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000, we'll mainly be able to afford one. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7381.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7387.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7394.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, Liberal tax, on vehicles? [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7396.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7403.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7408.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7411.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7419.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7423.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7429.48s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7431.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7439.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7446.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7452.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7453.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7457.48s)]
*  In French? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7461.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7467.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[02:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7469.48s)]
*  It is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered vehicles and diesel cars. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7479.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7492.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[02:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7499.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7505.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It's impossible. [[02:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7517.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will put an end to the tax on motor vehicles proposed by Liberals, [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7523.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7531.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on motor vehicles made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7534.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gasoline cars. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7543.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7549.48s)]
*  That is the choice. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7560.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which will increase prices for everything, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7562.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives that will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7566.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7574.48s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7576.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7579.48s)]
*  Hello. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7583.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president spoke of the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7584.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister told us that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7589.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7595.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said otherwise. I wasn't there. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7600.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[02:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7604.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7608.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7613.48s)]
*  And that means focusing on what we can control. [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7617.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7623.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7625.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7635.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7644.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7652.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of liberalism that has increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7658.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7668.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7672.48s)]
*  We must free the production of our resources and the construction of our homes. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7680.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in control. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7685.48s)]
*  The first liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7710.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7715.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7719.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7723.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7729.48s)]
*  to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7737.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[02:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7741.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7746.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7754.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7761.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal mandate. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7764.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut taxes and taxes, build homes, [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7768.48s)]
*  and free our natural resources to rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7776.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7784.48s)]
*  There is one word that describes the election. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7788.48s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[02:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7792.48s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets. [[02:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7797.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7800.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7808.48s)]
*  We need change. [[02:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7812.48s)]
*  And that is what conservatives will bring. [[02:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7814.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[02:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7817.48s)]
*  We have, is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7821.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7832.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7841.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Luttreau, and Chris D'Entremont. [[02:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7844.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7849.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[02:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7853.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[02:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7859.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7863.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7867.48s)]
*  And again, for a change. [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7872.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7874.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7880.48s)]
*  we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7885.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[02:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7889.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7894.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7901.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7906.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7912.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7918.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7922.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7929.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7933.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7938.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7943.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7951.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7956.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7963.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7967.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7972.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7977.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7982.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7986.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=7994.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8001.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8007.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[02:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8011.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8016.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8021.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8024.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8032.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8039.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8049.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8055.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8061.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8067.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8071.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8076.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8083.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic, [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8088.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[02:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8097.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8104.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8108.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8117.48s)]
*  Now yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8122.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[02:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8129.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8135.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal Government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8140.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8145.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8150.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8158.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[02:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8165.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8172.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8177.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8182.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8186.48s)]
*  Now that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8195.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8198.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8201.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8210.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[02:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8215.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8219.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8226.48s)]
*  It's not a penalty for the car company, [[02:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8233.48s)]
*  it's a new tax imposed on you, the consumer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8237.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8247.48s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8250.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8254.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8258.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[02:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8263.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[02:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8271.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8280.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8286.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8295.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8301.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8310.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8316.48s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8325.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[02:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8333.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8340.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8346.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8348.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8355.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8361.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8364.48s)]
*  Don't get fooled. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8371.48s)]
*  And it strikes directly. Our workers in the automotive sector, [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8376.48s)]
*  independent economists like Ross McKittrick, believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[02:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8381.48s)]
*  and cost our economy $138 billion. [[02:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8391.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8396.48s)]
*  Tesla. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8399.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump, say he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8401.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8409.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8416.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[02:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8420.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8430.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25 degrees. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8440.48s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8452.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8459.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8464.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8469.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8475.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8480.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem, this is a now problem. [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8491.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8496.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8506.48s)]
*  We're going to see the same effects at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8515.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8522.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8528.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8532.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8538.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We'll axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8555.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8564.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8570.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8575.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada. [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8580.48s)]
*  So you can save by buying Canadian. [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8591.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8601.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8608.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8615.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8628.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8638.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[02:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8643.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8649.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8656.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8666.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing the GST on those purchases. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8669.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8678.48s)]
*  The tax is over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8686.48s)]
*  The permanent restrictions on the cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[02:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8691.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8698.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8704.48s)]
*  But we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8708.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. [[02:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8715.48s)]
*  I will end the war against automobiles, liberals and the bloc. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8719.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8725.48s)]
*  People in Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8729.48s)]
*  They need a diesel-powered car. [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8735.48s)]
*  We will support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8740.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between liberals and the bloc, who simply want a tramway, or Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8749.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories, because we respect the contracts. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8760.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[02:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8769.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8780.48s)]
*  No more carney tax. No more carney quotas. No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8785.48s)]
*  We will not stop there. We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8792.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15 percent so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[02:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8797.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8804.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8815.48s)]
*  And we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15 percent every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8820.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8833.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8840.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8845.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians, [[02:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8857.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8869.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8875.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8879.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise. [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8887.48s)]
*  Where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home on a safe street under our proud flag. [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8896.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[02:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8904.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8909.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8912.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8922.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8926.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8935.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8939.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8946.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8948.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8958.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8962.48s)]
*  That it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8967.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8975.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[02:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8981.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8989.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[02:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=8995.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9000.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9005.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[02:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9013.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9018.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9025.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9032.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. Change so that people have hope again. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9037.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[02:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9043.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9050.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate you love. [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9054.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9059.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9062.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful home on a safe street. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9066.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9075.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians around Canada. [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9083.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9088.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9094.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[02:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9097.48s)]
*  But we need change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9100.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. Thank you very much. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9106.48s)]
*  I'm here in Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9130.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9133.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9141.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9149.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9153.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9156.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9162.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9168.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9172.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9178.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. Change so that they're safe on their streets. Change to put Canada first. [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9182.48s)]
*  That is our mission. And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9188.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9193.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9196.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[02:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9203.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9206.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9211.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9221.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9224.48s)]
*  In French. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9229.48s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9236.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9238.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9245.48s)]
*  And it's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9247.48s)]
*  People need change. [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9250.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[02:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9253.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9258.48s)]
*  Housing costs have increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9267.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9275.48s)]
*  After the lost destiny of the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, it needs to change. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9278.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9285.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9287.48s)]
*  free the construction of housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[02:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9295.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. Thank you very much. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9306.48s)]
*  I'm pleased to be here today to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9336.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[02:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9345.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[02:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9348.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000, we won't be able to afford one. [[02:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9355.48s)]
*  The old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car. They can't afford the Carney tax. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9361.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9366.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9370.48s)]
*  I will axe that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9376.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[02:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9381.48s)]
*  Both people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9384.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9391.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[02:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9396.48s)]
*  Here you have a choice. You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9402.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[02:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9412.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9419.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9425.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9430.48s)]
*  In French? [[02:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9435.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9440.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9442.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tariff war that would cost $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel engines. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9452.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9465.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9472.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[02:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9478.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It's impossible. [[02:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9490.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will end the tax on motor vehicles proposed by Liberal Democrats, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9496.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[02:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9504.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the tax on motor vehicles made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here to Canada. [[02:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9507.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[02:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9516.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9522.48s)]
*  That's the choice. Another fourth Liberal mandate that will increase prices for everything, [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9533.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives that will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9539.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9546.48s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9548.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9552.48s)]
*  Hello. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9555.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president spoke of the 51st State in his call with Mark Carney, [[02:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9556.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[02:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9562.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[02:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9568.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said otherwise. I wasn't there. [[02:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9572.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9576.48s)]
*  I wasn't there, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9580.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9586.48s)]
*  And that means focusing on what we can control. [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9589.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9594.48s)]
*  We can reverse the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised Justin Trudeau. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9597.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9607.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9616.48s)]
*  We must reverse all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9624.48s)]
*  We must change our policies. [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9630.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of liberal policies that have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9633.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[02:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9641.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[02:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9645.48s)]
*  We must free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[02:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9653.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in control with force. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9658.48s)]
*  I will say that I am not going to go into the details of the liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9683.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9690.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[02:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9695.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[02:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9699.48s)]
*  The construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9705.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9714.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[02:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9719.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[02:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9727.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9734.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal mandate. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9738.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut taxes and taxes, build homes, free our natural resources, [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9740.48s)]
*  and bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9750.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[02:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9757.48s)]
*  There is one word that describes the election. [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9761.48s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. Change so you are once again safe on your streets. [[02:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9764.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9772.48s)]
*  We need change. That is what conservatives will bring. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9784.48s)]
*  Today we are here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[02:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9789.48s)]
*  Is Rick Perkins here? Where is Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9794.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you Dr. Ellis. [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9804.48s)]
*  We've got Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Delcamont. [[02:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9809.48s)]
*  We're here today with our plan to bring change. [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9820.48s)]
*  After this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9825.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[02:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9831.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[02:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9835.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9839.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9844.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9846.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9857.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9866.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9874.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[02:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9885.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9895.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[02:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9901.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9905.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9910.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9915.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[02:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9923.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9928.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9936.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9940.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade, it's about how miserable life will become [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9945.48s)]
*  and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the liberals have created for us. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9952.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9958.48s)]
*  and not through hard work. It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[02:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9965.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[02:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9973.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9979.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[02:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9983.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9993.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=9996.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10004.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10011.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[02:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10021.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we're on after the lost liberal decade, we're to continue. [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10033.48s)]
*  It would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10040.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10044.48s)]
*  that a fourth liberal term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10053.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic, [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10061.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[02:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10069.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10077.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10080.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[02:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10089.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10094.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[02:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10102.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10107.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental health crisis and a loss of hope [[02:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10113.48s)]
*  feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[02:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10120.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10123.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10131.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10138.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[02:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10144.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[02:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10151.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10154.48s)]
*  which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[02:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10164.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[02:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10167.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10171.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10174.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10183.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10189.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10192.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10199.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[02:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10205.48s)]
*  It's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[02:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10210.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10219.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10226.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10231.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10236.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10244.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10253.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[02:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10259.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[02:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10268.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[02:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10274.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[02:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10283.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10289.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10291.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[02:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10300.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[02:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10305.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[02:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10312.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[02:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10318.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[02:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10321.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10328.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[02:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10334.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[02:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10337.48s)]
*  Don't get fooled. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10344.48s)]
*  And it strikes directly at our workers in the automotive sector. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10349.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10354.48s)]
*  and cost our economy $138 billion. [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10364.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[02:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10369.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10373.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10382.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[02:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10389.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10392.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10403.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[02:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10412.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10442.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10452.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10459.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10463.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[02:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10468.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10475.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10478.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10482.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10487.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10493.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[02:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10499.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10504.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[02:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10510.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10523.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[02:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10530.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10536.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10543.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10547.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10552.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[02:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10558.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10573.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10580.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10587.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10596.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10600.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10605.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[02:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10610.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10616.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10621.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10628.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[02:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10636.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[02:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10639.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10642.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10648.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will remove the tax on vehicles from power on the first day. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10652.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10658.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10660.48s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10664.48s)]
*  Be clear. If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10671.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10677.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[02:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10685.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[02:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10687.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10691.48s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10698.48s)]
*  The people in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[02:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10701.48s)]
*  They need a diesel-powered car. [[02:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10707.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[02:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10713.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10722.48s)]
*  or the Conservatives, who are supporting a third link. [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10729.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles, [[02:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10733.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10738.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[02:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10742.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[02:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10745.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10753.48s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10758.48s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10764.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[02:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10766.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15 per cent so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10769.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10777.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10784.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10788.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15 per cent every year, [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10793.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[02:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10799.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10805.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[03:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10812.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10815.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10817.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[03:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10824.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion? [[03:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10830.48s)]
*  Lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength. [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10839.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10848.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[03:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10852.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10860.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, [[03:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10865.48s)]
*  on a safe street under our proud flag. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10874.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10877.48s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[03:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10879.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10881.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10882.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10890.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10892.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10894.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10899.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10905.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[03:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10912.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[03:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10919.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10921.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[03:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10928.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10931.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[03:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10933.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10935.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[03:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10945.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10948.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10954.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[03:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10962.48s)]
*  We are one country. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10968.48s)]
*  We're a proud country. [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10969.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10971.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10972.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10977.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[03:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10979.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[03:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10986.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10991.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10997.48s)]
*  Enfantser. [[03:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=10999.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[03:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11005.48s)]
*  We need change. [[03:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11009.48s)]
*  We need change now more than ever. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11011.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11013.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11016.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[03:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11019.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian, get out and exercise your democratic right. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11023.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11027.48s)]
*  Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11029.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate that you love. [[03:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11031.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11053.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11055.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11057.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11059.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11061.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11063.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11065.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11067.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11069.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11071.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11073.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11075.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11077.48s)]
*  I'm going to give back to you. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11079.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11081.48s)]
*  Next question. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11083.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Pauliev. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11085.48s)]
*  Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11087.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11089.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? [[03:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11091.48s)]
*  And what have you been hearing from people here [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11093.48s)]
*  regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11095.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11097.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11099.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11101.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11103.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[03:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11111.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11121.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11125.48s)]
*  They want change. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11127.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[03:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11129.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11135.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11140.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11145.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[03:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11151.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11154.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[03:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11157.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[03:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11159.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11161.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11163.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11166.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11169.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11176.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11178.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11184.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11193.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11197.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11200.48s)]
*  In French. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11201.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11208.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11209.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11210.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11217.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11219.48s)]
*  People need change. [[03:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11222.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11225.48s)]
*  Food prices have exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11230.48s)]
*  Housing prices have increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11239.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11247.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime are increasing. [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11250.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[03:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11255.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11257.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11259.48s)]
*  free the construction of housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11267.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[03:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11278.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11281.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11282.48s)]
*  Next question. [[03:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11283.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Pauliev. [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11286.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11287.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[03:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11288.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11289.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11290.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11296.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11300.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[03:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11309.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11316.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11319.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. [[03:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11326.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11332.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11338.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[03:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11340.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11342.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11348.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11353.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[03:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11356.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11364.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11368.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[03:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11374.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11376.48s)]
*  If you vote conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11384.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[03:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11391.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11397.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11399.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11402.48s)]
*  In French? [[03:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11406.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11412.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[03:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11414.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered vehicles and diesel cars. [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11424.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11437.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[03:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11444.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11451.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[03:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11463.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11467.48s)]
*  On the contrary, conservatives will end the tax on motor vehicles proposed by the Liberals, [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11469.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[03:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11477.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here to Canada. [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11480.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11489.48s)]
*  With conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11495.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[03:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11506.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate from the Liberals will increase prices for everything, [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11507.48s)]
*  or a change with conservatives that will cut waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[03:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11512.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11519.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11525.48s)]
*  Hello. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11528.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st Method in his call with Mark Carney, [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11529.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussions. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11535.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[03:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11541.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[03:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11545.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[03:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11547.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[03:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11549.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11553.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11559.48s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[03:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11562.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[03:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11567.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11570.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[03:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11580.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11589.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[03:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11596.48s)]
*  Because after a decade lost of liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11603.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11613.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11617.48s)]
*  Free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[03:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11625.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11630.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11647.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11650.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take. [[03:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11652.48s)]
*  Which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[03:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11660.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[03:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11664.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11668.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[03:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11674.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[03:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11686.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11691.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11699.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11706.48s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11708.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11709.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, build homes, [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11713.48s)]
*  and change our economy. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11721.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11730.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11734.48s)]
*  Change. [[03:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11737.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11738.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11740.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11742.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11745.48s)]
*  And a falling economy under America's thumb. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11750.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[03:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11753.48s)]
*  We need change. [[03:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11757.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[03:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11759.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11762.48s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. [[03:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11766.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11768.48s)]

*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11798.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11804.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11806.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11808.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11812.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[03:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11817.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11819.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11830.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11838.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11846.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11851.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[03:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11858.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11868.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11871.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11874.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11878.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11883.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11888.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11896.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11901.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11909.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11913.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11918.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11922.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11930.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11939.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11946.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11956.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11966.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[03:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11969.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[03:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11977.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11984.48s)]
*  This in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=11994.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12006.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12017.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12033.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12049.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12053.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[03:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12062.48s)]
*  Now yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12067.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12080.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[03:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12085.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12095.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate. [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12103.48s)]
*  Or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[03:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12110.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas powered vehicles. [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12117.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12127.48s)]
*  Now that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12139.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[03:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12146.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas powered vehicles. [[03:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12155.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will have to pay a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on. [[03:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12164.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax imposed on you, the consumer, if you want to buy a car that is gas powered or hybrid. [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12178.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada. A country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12192.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out of touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12204.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12217.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the auto workers. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12225.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban on gas powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12231.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. That's billion with a B. [[03:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12246.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12257.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12263.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[03:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12278.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12290.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12300.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12309.48s)]
*  Don't get fooled by this policy, which is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12315.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost our economy $138 billion. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12323.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12341.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12346.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[03:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12354.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12362.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12375.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12385.48s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[03:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12397.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12404.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12409.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12420.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[03:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12425.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12432.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12436.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12441.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12451.48s)]
*  We're at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12460.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[03:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12466.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[03:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12472.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12477.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[03:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12483.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12490.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[03:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12509.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12515.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12520.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12525.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12546.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12553.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12560.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[03:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12573.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12583.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12594.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles like axing the GST on those purchases. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12611.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from the first day in power. [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12623.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12630.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a personal choice that we respect. But we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12643.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12660.48s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[03:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12670.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[03:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12685.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[03:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12695.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles because we respect the contracts. [[03:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12705.48s)]
*  We will stop the ban on cars Canadians want to drive. We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[03:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12735.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so that your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[03:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12742.48s)]
*  We will act the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12750.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12761.48s)]
*  We will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12766.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[03:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12778.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12785.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect Liberals for a fourth term, with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12790.48s)]
*  Or do we want change, with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians? [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12802.48s)]
*  And unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12814.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12820.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12824.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise. [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12833.48s)]
*  Where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street, under our proud flag. [[03:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12841.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12849.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12854.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12857.48s)]
*  Could you say your name and outlet? [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12864.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12868.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[03:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12872.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[03:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12885.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12892.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[03:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12895.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[03:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12901.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12904.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12909.48s)]
*  That it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[03:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12914.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[03:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12918.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[03:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12921.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[03:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12927.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[03:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12935.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12941.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12943.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12945.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12950.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12952.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12959.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[03:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12964.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12970.48s)]
*  Al Ponce. [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12972.48s)]
*  I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12978.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12982.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12986.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12989.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12992.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian, get out and exercise your democratic right. [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=12996.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[03:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13000.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate that you love. [[03:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13003.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13005.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13008.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a nice house on a safe street. [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13012.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13021.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13029.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost liberals, people have lost hope. [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13034.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13040.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[03:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13043.48s)]
*  In the end, it needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make changes. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13045.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13057.48s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13058.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[03:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13059.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[03:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13062.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[03:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13064.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13071.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13072.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[03:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13076.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[03:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13078.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13086.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[03:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13094.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13098.48s)]
*  They want change. [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13100.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13101.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13107.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[03:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13112.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13117.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13123.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[03:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13126.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13128.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[03:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13130.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[03:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13132.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13134.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13137.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13140.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13147.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[03:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13150.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13155.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13161.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[03:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13164.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13168.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[03:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13170.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13171.48s)]
*  In French. [[03:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13173.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13181.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13182.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[03:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13184.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[03:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13190.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13192.48s)]
*  People need change. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13195.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13198.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13203.48s)]
*  in the last five years. [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13210.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13212.48s)]
*  across Canada. [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13218.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13220.48s)]
*  After the decades lost to the Liberals, [[03:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13223.48s)]
*  costs and crime are increasing. [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13225.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13228.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[03:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13230.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government [[03:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13232.48s)]
*  that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13236.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13240.48s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[03:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13246.48s)]
*  That's the message for Nova Scotians. [[03:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13251.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13254.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13255.48s)]
*  Next question. [[03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13256.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13258.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[03:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13260.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[03:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13262.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13266.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13269.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13272.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13277.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax [[03:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13281.48s)]
*  on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[03:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13285.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13289.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13292.48s)]
*  of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[03:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13296.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[03:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13299.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13305.48s)]
*  and they can't afford a new car, [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13307.48s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax. [[03:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13309.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[03:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13311.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13313.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[03:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13315.48s)]
*  when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[03:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13317.48s)]
*  I will axe that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[03:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13321.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13326.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[03:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13329.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[03:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13333.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[03:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13337.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[03:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13341.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13345.48s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13349.48s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[03:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13352.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13358.48s)]
*  that is made in Canada, [[03:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13363.48s)]
*  and you're going to be creating jobs for fellow Canadians [[03:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13365.48s)]
*  and strengthening our economy. [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13368.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13370.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13372.48s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[03:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13374.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[03:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13376.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13379.48s)]
*  In French. [[03:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13381.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13385.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, [[03:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13387.48s)]
*  it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13392.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13394.48s)]
*  and it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13398.48s)]
*  during a tariff war to propose a tax of $20,000 [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13401.48s)]
*  for gas-powered cars and diesel engines. [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13407.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13410.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living [[03:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13417.48s)]
*  for Canadians who cannot pay. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13421.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[03:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13424.48s)]
*  when they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[03:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13430.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13436.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13441.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will end [[03:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13443.48s)]
*  the tax on motor vehicles proposed by Liberals [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13446.48s)]
*  and we will do differently. [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13450.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the tax on motor vehicles [[03:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13452.48s)]
*  made in Canada to promote domestic production [[03:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13455.48s)]
*  and bring jobs back to Canada. [[03:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13459.48s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, [[03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13461.48s)]
*  you will pay a $20,000 tax for gas-powered cars. [[03:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13463.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less, [[03:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13467.48s)]
*  no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13471.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[03:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13478.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals [[03:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13479.48s)]
*  that will increase prices for everything [[03:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13482.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13484.48s)]
*  that will cut waste, reduce taxes [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13487.48s)]
*  and make life more affordable. [[03:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13490.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13492.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13493.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13494.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13497.48s)]
*  Hello. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13500.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13501.48s)]
*  had spoken about the 51st Method [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13503.48s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney [[03:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13505.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had said [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13507.48s)]
*  that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty [[03:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13509.48s)]
*  during their discussions. [[03:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13512.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13513.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13517.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13519.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13521.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say [[03:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13525.48s)]
*  that Canada would never be an American state. [[03:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13528.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[03:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13531.48s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13534.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13540.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies [[03:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13542.48s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13547.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13552.48s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[03:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13556.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[03:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13561.48s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[03:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13564.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies [[03:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13568.48s)]
*  that have caused this dependence. [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13573.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of loss of liberals [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13575.48s)]
*  that has increased the cost and made our economy go down, [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13579.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13586.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government [[03:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13590.48s)]
*  that will cut gas, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13594.48s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13598.48s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[03:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13603.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13609.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[03:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13611.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[03:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13614.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[03:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13616.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13618.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13619.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[03:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13622.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13624.48s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[03:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13626.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13629.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13632.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13636.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13640.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[03:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13646.48s)]
*  and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13652.48s)]
*  that Liberals pushed south. [[03:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13657.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13659.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13664.48s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13672.48s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13675.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13679.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13680.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13681.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government [[03:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13685.48s)]
*  that will reduce taxes and taxes, build housing, [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13689.48s)]
*  and release our natural resources [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13693.48s)]
*  so that we can rebuild our economic strength to make changes. [[03:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13695.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[03:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13702.48s)]
*  There is one word that describes the election. [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13706.48s)]
*  Change. [[03:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13710.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[03:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13711.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13713.48s)]
*  Change so that you're once again safe on your streets. [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13715.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[03:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13718.48s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[03:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13723.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13726.48s)]
*  We need change. [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13730.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[03:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13732.48s)]
*  Today, we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[03:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13735.48s)]
*  We have – is Rick Perkins here? [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13739.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13741.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[03:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13742.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[03:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13743.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13744.48s)]
*  Dr. Ellis is here. [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13751.48s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13753.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[03:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13755.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Boudreau, and Chris D'Avdaman. [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13761.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[03:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13767.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost Liberal decade, [[03:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13770.48s)]
*  we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13773.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13776.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[03:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13778.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13780.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[03:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13784.48s)]
*  from a position of strength, again, for a change. [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13787.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13791.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13797.48s)]
*  we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13802.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13806.48s)]
*  and develop our resources. [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13809.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13811.48s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13817.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13819.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13824.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[03:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13831.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[03:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13836.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything, more expensive food, homes, and cars. [[03:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13840.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13846.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13850.48s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13853.48s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life, [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13857.48s)]
*  just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[03:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13860.48s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13866.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[03:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13868.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, [[03:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13873.48s)]
*  but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13875.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[03:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13881.48s)]
*  One section says, [[03:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13885.48s)]
*  2040, more snakes than ladders. [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13887.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13890.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13894.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13899.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13903.48s)]
*  through inheritance and not through hard work. [[03:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13909.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13912.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[03:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13918.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[03:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13924.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[03:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13929.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13934.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country, and even more so, and more shockingly so. [[03:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13939.48s)]
*  The government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13945.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13950.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13954.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[03:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13957.48s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13961.48s)]
*  This in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13967.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13973.48s)]
*  but the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13979.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[03:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13986.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[03:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13990.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[03:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=13995.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[03:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14001.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic, [[03:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14006.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[03:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14014.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict, [[03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14017.48s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14022.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14026.48s)]
*  in this Government of Canada report. [[03:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14033.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[03:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14035.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14040.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, many people in the crowd said, [[03:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14044.48s)]
*  what you are describing is Canada today, the desperation that many people already feel, [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14049.48s)]
*  a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[03:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14056.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[03:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14058.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[03:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14063.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14068.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[03:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14072.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[03:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14076.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[03:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14083.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[03:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14089.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[03:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14095.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[03:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14099.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[03:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14104.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[03:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14112.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[03:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14116.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle [[03:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14119.48s)]
*  if the Liberals are re-elected. [[03:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14126.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[03:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14128.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[03:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14133.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[03:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14137.48s)]
*  it will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[03:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14144.48s)]
*  That's not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[03:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14151.48s)]
*  It's a new tax imposed on you, the consumer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[03:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14155.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada. [[03:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14165.48s)]
*  A country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[03:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14168.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[03:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14172.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14177.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14181.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, [[03:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14189.48s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[03:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14195.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the auto workers. [[03:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14198.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14204.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14213.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[03:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14219.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[03:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14228.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[03:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14230.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[03:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14236.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[03:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14245.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[03:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14250.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14257.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14263.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[03:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14266.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus seven and minus 15. [[03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14273.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[03:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14279.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[03:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14282.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[03:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14288.48s)]
*  And it strikes directly. [[03:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14293.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, [[03:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14296.48s)]
*  I believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14302.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14309.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[03:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14314.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14316.48s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers, even Donald Trump, [[03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14319.48s)]
*  say he prefers when Liberals run Canada. [[03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14324.48s)]
*  And the reason why we're not going to the US is because we're going to be in the US. [[03:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14327.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14332.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14334.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14336.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14338.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14340.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14342.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14344.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14346.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14348.48s)]
*  And we're going to be in Canada. [[03:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14350.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[03:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14352.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14360.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14363.48s)]
*  Carney wrote, [[03:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14368.48s)]
*  I'm going to stop the taxing of gas-powered vehicles. [[03:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14370.48s)]
*  I'm going to stop the taxing of gas-powered vehicles. [[03:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14374.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[03:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14377.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, [[03:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14381.48s)]
*  Use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[03:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14383.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[03:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14387.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[03:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14392.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[03:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14395.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14398.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[04:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14404.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[04:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14408.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[04:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14411.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[04:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14413.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[04:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14420.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff. [[04:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14423.48s)]
*  And many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[04:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14427.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[04:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14432.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14438.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14444.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[04:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14449.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14451.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[04:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14455.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14462.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14465.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[04:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14471.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14478.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[04:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14481.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14483.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14485.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[04:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14487.48s)]
*  I have nothing against electric cars. [[04:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14489.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14491.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[04:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14493.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[04:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14495.48s)]
*  And I go even further, to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14497.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[04:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14503.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[04:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14512.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14525.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[04:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14527.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[04:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14532.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14542.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14546.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14550.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14553.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[04:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14556.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14562.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14567.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[04:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14574.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14582.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, [[04:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14584.48s)]
*  and we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[04:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14587.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14593.48s)]
*  My Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14596.48s)]
*  The tax cuts are over. [[04:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14603.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on gas cars is over. [[04:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14605.48s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and depend on are over. [[04:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14609.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[04:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14615.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14622.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[04:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14630.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[04:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14632.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the liberal and block cars. [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14637.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[04:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14643.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14646.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[04:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14652.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and trams. [[04:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14658.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberal and block cars, [[04:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14667.48s)]
*  which simply want a tram, or the Conservatives, which prefer a third link. [[04:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14671.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories, [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14678.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[04:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14684.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14688.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14691.48s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[04:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14695.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[04:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14699.48s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14704.48s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14710.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[04:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14712.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15%, so your hard work pays off [[04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14715.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14719.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities [[04:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14722.48s)]
*  to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[04:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14728.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14733.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14738.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[04:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14744.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14750.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[04:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14757.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[04:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14761.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14763.48s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[04:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14766.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14769.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[04:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14775.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14779.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, and unleash home building and resources [[04:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14784.48s)]
*  so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[04:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14790.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years, [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14793.48s)]
*  struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills, and now automobile bills. [[04:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14797.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[04:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14806.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[04:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14810.48s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, [[04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14814.48s)]
*  on a safe street under our proud flag. [[04:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14819.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[04:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14822.48s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14825.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14827.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14829.48s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[04:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14831.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[04:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14835.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[04:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14838.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14841.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[04:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14844.48s)]
*  have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[04:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14848.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government. [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14850.48s)]
*  The Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14853.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14857.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[04:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14864.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14867.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14873.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[04:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14876.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14878.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14881.48s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[04:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14886.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14891.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations, [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14894.48s)]
*  or if you've been here for six weeks, if you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[04:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14898.48s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[04:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14903.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[04:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14908.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14913.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[04:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14916.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[04:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14918.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[04:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14923.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[04:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14925.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[04:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14931.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[04:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14936.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14942.48s)]
*  Alphonse. [[04:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14944.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14946.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[04:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14950.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[04:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14954.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again, something that has been lost these last few years. [[04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14958.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[04:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14964.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[04:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14968.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[04:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14972.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14976.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[04:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14978.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise, the promise of Canada, [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14980.48s)]
*  that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful home on a safe street. [[04:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14985.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[04:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=14993.48s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians around Canada. [[04:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15001.48s)]
*  After the decade lost to the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15006.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15012.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15015.48s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15017.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[04:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15024.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15029.48s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[04:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15030.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15031.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15034.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, [[04:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15036.48s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[04:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15039.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15043.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[04:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15044.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15049.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[04:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15051.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[04:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15058.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[04:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15067.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[04:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15070.48s)]
*  They want change. [[04:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15073.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15074.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15080.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[04:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15085.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15090.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[04:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15096.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[04:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15099.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[04:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15102.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15104.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[04:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15106.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[04:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15108.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[04:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15111.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[04:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15114.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[04:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15121.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15124.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[04:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15129.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[04:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15135.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15138.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[04:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15142.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[04:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15144.48s)]

*  People need change. [[04:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15168.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[04:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15170.48s)]
*  in the last five years. [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15175.48s)]

*  Criminality is now out of control. [[04:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15183.48s)]
*  After the lost decade of the Liberals, the costs and criminalization of the Canadian [[04:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15187.48s)]
*  people have increased. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15193.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[04:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15195.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, [[04:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15198.48s)]
*  cut tax and tax, free housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable [[04:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15203.48s)]

*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15232.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[04:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15233.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15234.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[04:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15235.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15236.48s)]
*  that impact is limited? [[04:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15240.68s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney Tax. [[04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15242.48s)]
*  The – can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals [[04:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15245.48s)]
*  the Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered [[04:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15252.48s)]
*  vehicles. It is utterly reckless. Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous [[04:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15261.199999999999s)]
*  policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. Taxing your vehicle at [[04:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15268.439999999999s)]
*  $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. So when people's old vehicle [[04:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15273.92s)]
*  is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, how [[04:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15279.96s)]
*  are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? And how are we going to keep [[04:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15284.519999999999s)]
*  jobs in this country when there's a new tax, Liberal tax, on vehicles? I will axe that [[04:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15288.919999999998s)]
*  tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. They will make their own decisions [[04:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15295.119999999999s)]
*  for themselves. Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect [[04:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15300.72s)]
*  their ability to make that decision. Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian [[04:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15307.820000000002s)]
*  automobiles. So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. So here you have a choice. [[04:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15312.980000000001s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered [[04:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15322.78s)]
*  automobile. You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made [[04:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15330.220000000001s)]
*  in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening [[04:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15336.74s)]
*  our economy. This is the way we need to go. We need to put our country first for a change, [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15342.24s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank [[04:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15346.619999999999s)]
*  you. With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Coulter to say that he's going to [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15353.619999999999s)]
*  pay a $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars and diesel trucks. It will kill jobs for car workers [[04:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15366.74s)]
*  in the automotive industry, but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15388.02s)]
*  who can no longer afford to pay. How can someone replace their car when they don't [[04:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15395.02s)]
*  have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? What will they do to get jobs? It's impossible. [[04:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15404.02s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will put an end to the tax on automobiles offered by Liberal [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15414.7s)]
*  Democrats, and we'll do otherwise. We'll eliminate the sale tax on automobiles made in Canada [[04:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15422.380000000001s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. So the choice with the Liberal [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15430.26s)]
*  Democrats is that you'll pay a $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars. With the Conservatives, [[04:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15436.26s)]
*  you'll pay less, no TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada than you would on the [[04:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15442.62s)]
*  American market. That's the choice. Another four-fifth Liberal mandate that will increase [[04:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15451.7s)]
*  prices for everything, or a change with the Conservatives that will cut gas-fuel, reduce [[04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15458.7s)]
*  taxes and make life more affordable. Thank you very much. [[04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15466.060000000001s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. We learned that the American president had spoken [[04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15474.060000000001s)]
*  to Mark Carney on the call of the 51st State, while the Prime Minister said that Trump [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15477.06s)]
*  had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. How do you interpret this? [[04:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15484.06s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. I wasn't there. It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain [[04:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15489.06s)]
*  this. I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada will never be an American state. [[04:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15497.06s)]
*  We have to defend our sovereignty. This means that we have to concentrate on what we can [[04:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15504.06s)]
*  control. What can we control? We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney [[04:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15511.06s)]
*  advised to Justin Trudeau. The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to [[04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15523.06s)]
*  expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. The policies that have blocked [[04:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15530.06s)]
*  our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. We have to overthrow [[04:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15536.06s)]
*  all the liberal policies that have caused this dependence. Because after a decade lost [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15543.06s)]

*  price of a fourth liberal mandate. We need a change with a new conservative government [[04:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15560.06s)]
*  that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, free the production of our resources [[04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15566.06s)]

*  clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. We will never be an American state. We will [[04:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15592.06s)]
*  focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[04:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15597.06s)]

*  taxes and bringing down the cost of living. Change by unleashing the construction of new [[04:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15616.06s)]

*  good jobs, and powerful paychecks to unleash our resources in order to stand up to the [[04:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15755.06s)]
*  Americans from a position of strength. Again, for a change. Over the next four years, my [[04:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15760.06s)]
*  plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, [[04:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15767.06s)]
*  and bureaucracy. We are going to cut handouts to insiders and we are going to unleash our [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15774.06s)]
*  economy to build more homes and develop our resources. By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned [[04:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15780.06s)]
*  deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. Not only is he promising [[04:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15786.06s)]
*  to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, he is promising to add another $130 [[04:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15793.06s)]
*  billion on top of it. Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[04:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15800.06s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt which will drive up prices [[04:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15808.06s)]
*  for everything. More expensive food, homes, and cars. Add it all up and you can't afford [[04:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15815.06s)]
*  a fourth term. To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike [[04:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15822.06s)]
*  taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from [[04:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15826.06s)]
*  affording a decent life. Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was [[04:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15831.06s)]
*  acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. We've seen the rapid decline over the last [[04:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15838.06s)]
*  decade in our quality of life. I don't know if you saw the story this week, but this incredible [[04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15843.06s)]
*  report that the government has published about how the future looks. They call it Future [[04:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15848.06s)]
*  Lives, Social Mobility in Question. One section says 2040, more snakes than ladders. In this [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15854.06s)]
*  report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade, it's about how miserable life [[04:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15862.06s)]
*  will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the Liberals [[04:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15869.06s)]
*  have created for us. The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be [[04:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15875.06s)]
*  able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. It says that homes [[04:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15881.06s)]
*  will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, that property ownership [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15886.06s)]
*  and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon [[04:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15893.06s)]
*  the idea of buying single-family dwellings. We see here that the government is warning [[04:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15899.06s)]
*  that over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[04:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15905.06s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country, and even more so, and more shockingly so, [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15911.06s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, people [[04:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15918.06s)]
*  will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to [[04:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15923.06s)]
*  regulations. In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in [[04:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15928.06s)]
*  order to scrounge for food on public lands. This in Canada, a country blessed with the [[04:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15934.06s)]
*  most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[04:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15943.06s)]
*  but the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, would [[04:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15949.06s)]
*  lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. Now, I believe this report should be [[04:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15955.06s)]
*  on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture [[04:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15961.06s)]
*  that a fourth Liberal term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15967.06s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic, and inequality between [[04:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15977.06s)]
*  those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political [[04:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15983.06s)]
*  conflict, and that people may lose faith in the fact that they will be forced to live [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15989.06s)]
*  in a home, and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. It sounds like an [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=15995.06s)]
*  incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16000.06s)]
*  They're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[04:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16008.06s)]
*  Yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts [[04:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16013.06s)]
*  of this report, many people in the crowd said what you were describing is Canada today, [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16019.06s)]
*  the desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[04:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16025.06s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental health crisis [[04:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16031.06s)]
*  and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. Already, many Canadians cannot [[04:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16037.06s)]
*  afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[04:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16043.06s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, or let's call it [[04:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16049.06s)]
*  what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16057.06s)]
*  auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[04:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16066.06s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, [[04:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16072.06s)]
*  which will obviously be passed on to consumers. Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, [[04:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16082.06s)]
*  they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. If you want to buy a vehicle that is [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16088.06s)]
*  gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[04:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16094.06s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[04:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16101.06s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[04:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16107.06s)]
*  it will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, [[04:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16117.06s)]
*  it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16128.06s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[04:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16137.06s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, where Canadian workers in places like [[04:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16145.06s)]
*  Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers [[04:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16151.06s)]
*  and Liberal ideologues, people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16160.06s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[04:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16167.06s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this [[04:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16175.06s)]
*  Liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[04:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16181.06s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. That's billion with a B. [[04:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16192.06s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[04:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16203.06s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16209.06s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[04:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16219.06s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[04:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16227.06s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[04:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16236.06s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16241.06s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16252.06s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it hits directly on our workers in the automotive sector. [[04:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16261.06s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[04:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16272.06s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. We're talking about billions. And who will benefit? Tesla. [[04:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16282.06s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers. Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16292.06s)]
*  And he says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16300.06s)]
*  And he says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16304.06s)]
*  And he says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16308.06s)]
*  And he says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16312.06s)]
*  And he says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[04:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16316.06s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[04:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16320.06s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or somewhere else in the great Northern part of Canada where it's minus 25. [[04:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16331.06s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[04:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16342.06s)]
*  together. Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. Carney [[04:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16349.06s)]
*  wrote that we need to, quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our [[04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16355.019999999999s)]
*  economy, such as explicit timetables to phase out internal combustion engines. These measures [[04:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16359.58s)]
*  are critical, he says, and that's exactly what he plans to do. The Liberals have set [[04:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16366.6s)]
*  a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased [[04:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16372.3s)]
*  in starting next year. In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem, this is a now problem. [[04:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16379.66s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[04:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16387.44s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. Many will have to lay off [[04:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16393.96s)]
*  salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16398.44s)]
*  Canadian consumers, this at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers [[04:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16404.26s)]
*  are taxed to the max. Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between [[04:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16410.48s)]
*  affording a warm home or a working car. He doesn't care if a young couple trying to [[04:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16414.719999999998s)]
*  start a life can't afford their first vehicle. Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians [[04:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16420.059999999998s)]
*  are taking back control of their lives for a change. A new Conservative government will [[04:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16425.52s)]
*  axe the Carney tax. We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to [[04:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16431.2s)]
*  revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. No $20,000 tax on gas-powered [[04:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16450.2s)]
*  cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. Let me be clear, I have nothing [[04:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16458.08s)]
*  against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. Free choice. Make your own decision. [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16462.96s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. And I go even further to say that [[04:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16468.12s)]
*  a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any [[04:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16472.96s)]
*  vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. And that will allow us [[04:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16478.5s)]
*  to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[04:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16493.06s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[04:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16498.78s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax [[04:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16506.3s)]
*  on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. Conservatives [[04:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16512.98s)]
*  will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for [[04:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16519.579999999998s)]
*  you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. Conservatives will [[04:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16525.48s)]
*  maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements [[04:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16530.34s)]
*  for the auto sector that the government has made. But we will not force Canadians to [[04:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16536.82s)]
*  pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the [[04:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16543.3s)]
*  EVs and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16550.3s)]
*  up agreements. We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. And we will go [[04:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16556.3s)]
*  even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles [[04:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16561.12s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[04:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16566.76s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16569.76s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on gasoline cars is over. The permanent restrictions [[04:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16576.76s)]
*  on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[04:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16584.28s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a [[04:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16589.28s)]
*  personal choice that we respect. But we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16596.28s)]
*  a free choice. But in the regions, people need their cars. I will end the war against [[04:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16603.96s)]
*  cars, the Liberals and the Bloc. I believe Canadians should be able to choose. People [[04:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16611.96s)]
*  in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. They need a car with [[04:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16619.96s)]
*  gasoline and diesel. We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric [[04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16628.96s)]
*  cars and highways. In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who [[04:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16635.96s)]
*  simply want a highway, or the Conservatives, who are supporting a third link. We will respect [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16644.719999999998s)]
*  all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories because we [[04:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16652.399999999998s)]
*  respect the contracts. [[04:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16658.2s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense instead of being driven [[04:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16660.6s)]
*  by fantastical Liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs [[04:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16664.6s)]
*  out. A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. No more carney [[04:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16670.48s)]
*  tax, no more carney quotas, no more Liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. We will [[04:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16677.48s)]
*  not stop there. We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. We will [[04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16683.48s)]
*  cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar [[04:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16688.44s)]
*  you earn. We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut [[04:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16694.68s)]
*  their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. We will sell off federal [[04:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16701.36s)]
*  land to build 300,000 additional homes and we will incentivize all levels of government [[04:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16708.2s)]
*  to speed up building permits by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million [[04:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16714.52s)]
*  new homes built over the next half decade. This will allow us to bring home jobs for [[04:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16720.88s)]
*  construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[04:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16726.84s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It cannot be more clear. After a lost Liberal [[04:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16731.36s)]
*  decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect Liberals for a fourth term with a [[04:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16737.36s)]
*  reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? Or do we want change [[04:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16743.52s)]
*  with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid [[04:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16750.920000000002s)]
*  by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so [[04:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16755.760000000002s)]
*  we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? After the lost Liberal decade, [[04:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16763.28s)]
*  we cannot afford four more years. Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant [[04:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16768.68s)]
*  grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. We need a new Conservative government [[04:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16774.96s)]
*  that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, [[04:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16781.239999999998s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable [[04:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16785.36s)]
*  home, on a safe street under our proud flag. That is what it means to bring change. [[04:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16792.36s)]
*  Now let's bring it home. [[04:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16798.16s)]
*  The parties and leaders for the last number of weeks have been telling us how they are [[04:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16818.52s)]
*  different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister [[04:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16822.84s)]
*  will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they [[04:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16826.9s)]
*  have. So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in [[04:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16830.300000000003s)]
*  our future? [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16836.800000000003s)]
*  That's a very good question. Canadians have been divided by their government over the [[04:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16838.02s)]
*  last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. [[04:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16844.54s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. What unites this country is what I call the [[04:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16851.260000000002s)]
*  Canadian promise that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[04:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16857.460000000003s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. It doesn't matter if you've been here for [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16863.82s)]
*  – if your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. If [[04:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16868.260000000002s)]
*  you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16873.5s)]
*  life and a beautiful home on a safe street. I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite [[04:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16877.28s)]
*  people around that purpose. We are one country. We're a proud country. I owe everything to [[04:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16884.52s)]
*  this country. It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16890.239999999998s)]
*  you at this stage. I'm going to give that back, but my goal is to make sure that every [[04:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16894.719999999998s)]
*  single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity, every single senior [[04:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16900.12s)]
*  that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. So let us unite our [[04:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16905.72s)]
*  country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16910.84s)]
*  The thing that will bring us together now is change. We need change. We need change [[04:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16925.4s)]
*  now more than ever. Change so that people have hope again, something that has been lost [[04:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16930.24s)]
*  these last few years. Change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. I ask every single [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16936.480000000003s)]
*  Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, [[04:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16942.640000000003s)]
*  safe life. Vote for the candidate you love. Thank you very much for your question. We [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16948.640000000003s)]
*  need to unite our country around our promise, the promise of Canada, that everyone who works [[04:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16954.239999999998s)]
*  hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street, no matter your modest or [[04:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16960.04s)]
*  advantageous origins. You should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. And this [[04:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16969.2s)]
*  beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. After the decade of lost of [[04:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16975.28s)]
*  freedom, people have lost hope. They are more divided than ever. We cannot allow a [[04:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16982.28s)]
*  fourth liberal mandate. It has to change with a new Conservative government that will unite [[04:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16989.48s)]
*  Canadians around this promise and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone [[04:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=16994.8s)]
*  to make change. Thank you very much. [[04:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17001.92s)]
*  Next question. [[04:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17004.0s)]
*  Good morning Mr. Pauliev, Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. During the final days [[04:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17005.199999999997s)]
*  of the campaign, what made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now and what have you [[04:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17008.8s)]
*  been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[04:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17012.92s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. [[04:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17017.16s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17024.48s)]
*  thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[04:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17031.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. What I'm hearing is that people want change. They [[04:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17038.48s)]
*  want change. After a lost liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or [[04:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17043.48s)]
*  house themselves. Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in [[04:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17048.48s)]
*  the country. The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is a huge problem. And I think [[04:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17054.48s)]
*  the crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. And we can't afford a fourth [[04:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17060.48s)]
*  liberal term of rising costs and crime. The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[04:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17066.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[04:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17073.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. That is our mission. And we're here with a plan to deliver that [[04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17077.48s)]
*  change. A plan that in fact is called change. It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks [[04:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17083.48s)]
*  by lowering income tax by 15%. It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. It will [[04:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17091.48s)]
*  lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. And so I'm here with a hopeful [[04:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17097.48s)]
*  message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the [[04:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17104.92s)]
*  corner. If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. We will unite our [[04:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17111.48s)]
*  country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[04:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17116.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17119.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17120.48s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's a very [[04:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17121.48s)]
*  beautiful province. It's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. People need change. [[04:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17128.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here [[04:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17136.48s)]
*  in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. I'm very grateful for the [[04:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17144.48s)]
*  opportunity to be here and to be able to talk about change. I'm very grateful for the opportunity [[04:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17149.48s)]
*  to be here. The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city in [[04:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17158.48s)]
*  Canada. Criminality is now out of control. After the decades lost to the Liberals, costs [[04:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17164.48s)]
*  and crime that are increasing, it needs to change. We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[04:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17172.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, cut tax [[04:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17177.48s)]
*  taxes, free housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[04:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17185.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. Thank you very much. [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17196.48s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[04:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17200.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Pat Healy from the Laker News. With the threat of U.S. tariffs [[04:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17203.48s)]
*  impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[04:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17209.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17215.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on [[04:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17223.48s)]
*  Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? It is utterly reckless. Not only is Mr. Carney continuing [[04:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17231.48s)]
*  with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. Taxing [[04:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17239.48s)]
*  your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. So when people's old [[04:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17245.48s)]
*  vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, [[04:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17251.48s)]
*  how are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? And how are we going to [[04:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17256.48s)]
*  keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, Liberal tax, on vehicles? I will ask [[04:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17260.48s)]
*  that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. They will make their [[04:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17266.48s)]
*  own decisions for themselves. Rural people, suburban folks need cars and trucks, and we [[04:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17271.48s)]
*  need to protect their ability to make that decision. Furthermore, we want to encourage [[04:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17278.48s)]
*  Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[04:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17282.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get [[04:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17289.48s)]
*  a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. You vote Conservative, you're going to get [[04:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17297.48s)]
*  a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs for [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17305.48s)]
*  fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. This is the way we need to go. We need to [[04:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17312.48s)]
*  put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, put affordable cars and [[04:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17317.48s)]

*  In French. [[04:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17325.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose [[04:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17330.48s)]
*  a $20,000 tax on gasoline and diesel cars. It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile [[04:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17341.48s)]
*  industry, but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who cannot pay. How [[04:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17348.48s)]
*  can this be when someone is paying for a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17356.48s)]
*  but they cannot pay another $20,000 in tax on the Liberals? What will they do to get [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17366.48s)]
*  to work? It is impossible. On the contrary, Conservatives will end the tax on car drivers [[04:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17374.48s)]
*  that the Liberals propose and the tax on the people of Canada. [[04:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17384.48s)]
*  We will do otherwise. We will eliminate the tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17392.48s)]
*  production and bring jobs here in Canada. So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17400.48s)]
*  a $20,000 tax on gasoline cars. With Conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on new cars [[04:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17407.48s)]
*  and trucks made in Canada. That is the choice. Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which [[04:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17417.48s)]
*  will increase prices for everything, or a change with Conservatives, which will cut [[04:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17425.48s)]
*  the waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. Thank you very much. [[04:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17431.48s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17437.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. We learned that the American president had spoken [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17442.48s)]
*  about the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, while the Prime Minister had said [[04:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17449.48s)]
*  that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussion. How do you [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17454.48s)]
*  interpret this? Mr. Carney said the opposite. I was not there. It is clear that Mr. Carney [[04:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17459.48s)]
*  must explain this. I was not on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be [[04:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17468.48s)]
*  an American state. We must defend our sovereignty. And that means focusing on what we can control. [[04:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17474.48s)]
*  What can we control? We can reverse the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised [[04:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17484.48s)]
*  Justin Trudeau. The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion [[04:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17496.48s)]
*  of investments in the United States. The policies that blocked our natural resources and gave [[04:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17504.48s)]
*  our oil to Americans at low prices. We must reverse all liberal policies that caused [[04:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17510.48s)]
*  this dependence. After a decade of liberal policies that increased the cost and made our [[04:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17519.48s)]
*  economy fall, we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. We need a change [[04:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17529.48s)]
*  with a new conservative government that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[04:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17536.48s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, and bring our [[04:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17543.48s)]
*  jobs here to keep Americans in control with force. [[04:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17549.48s)]
*  The first liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17573.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. My approach is to bring [[04:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17577.48s)]
*  change. Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. Change [[04:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17584.48s)]
*  by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half [[04:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17593.48s)]
*  trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. Change so that Canadians can create jobs [[04:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17601.48s)]
*  here at home. My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy so that [[04:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17608.48s)]
*  we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position [[04:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17617.48s)]
*  of strength for a change. Thank you very much. [[04:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17623.48s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[04:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17626.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal mandate. We need a change with a new conservative [[04:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17628.48s)]
*  government that will cut taxes and taxes, build homes, free our natural resources, and [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17633.48s)]
*  bring back our economic strength to make a change. It's great to be here in Nova Scotia [[04:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17641.48s)]
*  in this change election. There is one word that describes the election. Change. Change [[04:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17650.48s)]
*  so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. Change so you're once again [[04:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17656.48s)]
*  safe on your streets. After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling [[04:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17661.48s)]
*  economy under America's thumb, we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. We need change. [[04:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17669.48s)]
*  And that is what conservatives will bring. Today we're here with our incredible team [[04:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17677.48s)]
*  that will bring that change. We have, is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. [[04:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17683.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[04:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17688.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[04:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17695.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and [[04:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17700.48s)]
*  Chris Delcame. And we're here today with our plan to bring change. You know, after [[04:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17710.48s)]
*  this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. Change [[04:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17717.48s)]
*  to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. Change to bring [[04:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17722.48s)]
*  safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. To unleash our resources in order to stand [[04:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17727.48s)]
*  up to the Americans from a position of strength again for a change. Over the last four, over [[04:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17732.48s)]
*  the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, [[04:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17738.48s)]
*  consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. We're going to cut handouts to insiders and [[04:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17744.48s)]
*  we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. By contrast, [[04:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17751.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[04:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17757.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, he's [[04:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17764.48s)]
*  promising to add another $130 billion on top of it, combining Trudeau's planned spending [[04:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17769.48s)]
*  with Mark Carney's new promises. Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17778.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. More expensive food, homes, and cars. Add it all up [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17785.48s)]
*  and you can't afford a fourth term. To pay for the debt, the liberals will have to print even more [[04:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17793.48s)]
*  money, hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people [[04:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17798.48s)]
*  from affording a decent life, just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[04:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17804.48s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our [[04:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17811.48s)]
*  quality of life. I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the [[04:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17817.48s)]
*  government has published about how the future looks. They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in [[04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17823.48s)]
*  Question. One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. In this report, it's not just about the [[04:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17829.48s)]
*  last lost liberal decade, it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on [[04:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17838.48s)]
*  the current trajectory that the liberals have created for us. The report that the government [[04:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17845.48s)]
*  publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through [[04:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17850.48s)]
*  hard work. It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, that [[04:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17856.48s)]
*  property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations [[04:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17864.48s)]
*  abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. We see here that the government is warning that [[04:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17871.48s)]
*  over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. Many workers [[04:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17877.48s)]
*  might have to leave the country and even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that [[04:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17885.48s)]
*  because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in [[04:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17891.48s)]
*  public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. In other words, people will have no [[04:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17897.48s)]
*  choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. This in Canada, a [[04:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17903.48s)]
*  country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity [[04:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17914.48s)]
*  anywhere in the world. But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[04:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17923.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. Now, I believe this report should be on the [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17931.48s)]
*  front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal [[04:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17938.48s)]
*  term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. This report says that owning a home [[04:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17945.48s)]
*  in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become [[04:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17955.48s)]
*  a driver of social, economic and political conflict and that people may lose faith in the Canadian [[04:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17963.48s)]
*  project. It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of [[04:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17970.48s)]
*  Canada report. They're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[04:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17979.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[04:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17985.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said what you were describing is Canada today. The desperation that many people [[04:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=17992.48s)]
*  already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse after 10 years of Liberal Government, the predictions [[05:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18000.48s)]
*  of housing shortages, a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[05:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18007.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy [[05:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18014.48s)]
*  a car either. And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate or let's call it [[05:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18020.48s)]
*  what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[05:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18030.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the [[05:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18040.48s)]
*  Government-imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to [[05:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18047.48s)]
*  consumers. Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the [[05:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18056.48s)]
*  consumer. If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the [[05:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18063.48s)]
*  Liberals are re-elected. Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the [[05:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18072.48s)]
*  opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed [[05:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18079.48s)]
*  quota, they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. That's not a penalty for the car manufacturer, [[05:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18087.48s)]
*  it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[05:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18099.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, where prices on [[05:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18110.48s)]
*  everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing [[05:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18118.48s)]
*  their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, people who spend [[05:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18125.48s)]
*  too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[05:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18135.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. Independent economist [[05:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18143.48s)]
*  Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the [[05:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18151.48s)]
*  remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[05:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18162.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. Mark Carney wants you to [[05:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18173.48s)]
*  pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad [[05:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18183.48s)]
*  once again. No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. Of course he does, [[05:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18195.48s)]
*  because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[05:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18204.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. And that number comes from tests [[05:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18211.48s)]
*  between minus 7 and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 [[05:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18221.48s)]
*  or colder. Don't get fooled by this policy, which is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. Our workers in the [[05:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18232.48s)]
*  automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[05:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18243.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla, foreign automakers, [[05:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18254.48s)]
*  American workers. Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. Of course he does, [[05:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18266.48s)]
*  because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[05:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18273.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. And that number comes from tests [[05:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18283.48s)]
*  between minus 7 and minus 15. So try in Saskatchewan in January or another route in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[05:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18295.48s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. Listen to the quote from his book, [[05:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18315.48s)]
*  which he wrote just four years ago. Carney wrote that we need to, quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[05:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18324.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[05:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18332.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[05:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18343.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[05:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18353.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices [[05:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18365.48s)]
*  dramatically on Canadian consumers, this at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18375.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life [[05:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18384.48s)]
*  can't afford their first vehicle. Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[05:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18393.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[05:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18401.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[05:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18405.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[05:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18427.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[05:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18436.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[05:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18442.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[05:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18457.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[05:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18471.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[05:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18478.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[05:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18491.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[05:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18501.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[05:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18512.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing the GST on those purchases. [[05:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18529.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from the first day in power. [[05:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18542.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[05:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18549.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a personal choice that we respect. But we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[05:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18561.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[05:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18578.48s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[05:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18588.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[05:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18603.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles because we respect the contracts. [[05:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18623.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[05:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18653.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[05:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18667.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes and incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[05:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18678.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[05:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18695.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[05:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18702.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect Liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[05:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18707.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[05:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18720.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[05:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18738.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[05:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18751.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. [[05:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18767.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18771.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18773.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[05:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18776.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[05:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18786.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[05:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18790.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[05:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18803.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[05:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18810.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[05:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18813.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[05:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18819.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[05:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18822.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise that doesn't matter where you come from. [[05:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18827.48s)]
*  It matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[05:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18835.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[05:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18839.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[05:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18845.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[05:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18853.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[05:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18859.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[05:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18861.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[05:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18863.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[05:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18868.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[05:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18870.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[05:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18876.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[05:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18882.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18888.48s)]
*  Enfants. [[05:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18890.48s)]
*  I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18896.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[05:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18900.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[05:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18904.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[05:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18906.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[05:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18910.48s)]
*  I'm going to ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[05:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18914.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[05:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18918.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[05:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18921.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[05:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18923.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[05:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18926.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a nice house on a safe street. [[05:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18930.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[05:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18939.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18947.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. [[05:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18952.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[05:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18958.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[05:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18961.48s)]
*  In the end, it needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make changes. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18963.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18975.48s)]
*  Next question. [[05:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18976.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[05:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18977.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[05:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18980.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[05:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18982.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18989.48s)]
*  It's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[05:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18991.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[05:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18994.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[05:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=18995.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[05:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19004.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[05:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19012.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[05:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19015.48s)]
*  They want change. [[05:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19018.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[05:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19019.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[05:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19025.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[05:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19030.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[05:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19035.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[05:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19041.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[05:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19044.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[05:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19047.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[05:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19049.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[05:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19051.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[05:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19053.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[05:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19056.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[05:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19059.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[05:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19066.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[05:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19068.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[05:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19074.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[05:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19083.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[05:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19087.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[05:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19089.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19090.48s)]
*  In French. [[05:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19092.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19099.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19100.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[05:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19102.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[05:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19108.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[05:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19110.48s)]
*  People need change. [[05:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19113.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[05:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19116.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[05:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19121.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[05:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19130.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[05:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19138.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime are increasing. [[05:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19141.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[05:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19146.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[05:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19148.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[05:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19150.48s)]
*  free the construction of housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[05:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19158.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[05:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19168.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19171.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19172.48s)]
*  Next question. [[05:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19173.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[05:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19176.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[05:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19177.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[05:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19178.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[05:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19179.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[05:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19180.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[05:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19186.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[05:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19190.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[05:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19199.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[05:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19206.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[05:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19209.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[05:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19217.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, [[05:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19223.48s)]
*  how are they going to get to work? [[05:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19229.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[05:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19231.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[05:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19233.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[05:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19239.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[05:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19244.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[05:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19247.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[05:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19254.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[05:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19259.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[05:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19265.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[05:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19267.48s)]
*  If you vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[05:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19275.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[05:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19282.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[05:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19288.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[05:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19289.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[05:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19293.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19296.48s)]
*  In French? [[05:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19298.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19303.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[05:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19306.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tariff war that would cost $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel engines. [[05:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19315.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[05:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19328.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[05:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19335.48s)]
*  How can it be that when someone has to replace their car, [[05:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19341.48s)]
*  but they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[05:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19347.48s)]
*  What are they going to do to get to work? [[05:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19353.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[05:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19357.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will end the tax on motor vehicles proposed by Liberals, [[05:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19359.48s)]
*  and we'll do it differently. [[05:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19367.48s)]
*  We'll eliminate the sale tax on motor vehicles made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[05:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19370.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[05:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19379.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[05:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19385.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[05:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19396.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[05:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19397.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate from the Liberals that will increase prices for everything, [[05:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19398.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives that will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[05:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19403.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19410.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19412.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[05:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19413.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteux, Radio-Canada. [[05:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19416.48s)]
*  Hello. [[05:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19419.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken of the 51st State in his call with Mark Carney, [[05:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19420.48s)]
*  and the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussions. [[05:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19426.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[05:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19431.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[05:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19435.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[05:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19437.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[05:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19439.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada would never be an American state. [[05:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19443.48s)]
*  We have to defend our sovereignty. [[05:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19449.48s)]
*  And that means we have to focus on what we can control. [[05:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19452.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[05:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19457.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[05:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19460.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[05:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19470.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[05:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19479.48s)]
*  We have to overthrow all the liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[05:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19486.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of loss of liberals that has increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[05:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19493.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[05:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19504.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[05:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19508.48s)]
*  Free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[05:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19516.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs back here to keep Americans in control with force. [[05:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19521.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[05:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19527.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[05:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19529.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[05:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19532.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[05:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19534.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[05:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19536.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[05:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19537.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[05:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19540.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[05:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19542.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[05:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19550.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[05:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19554.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[05:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19558.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[05:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19564.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[05:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19577.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[05:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19582.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[05:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19590.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19597.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[05:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19598.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[05:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19600.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, build homes, free our natural resources, [[05:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19603.48s)]
*  and be able to rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[05:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19613.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[05:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19620.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[05:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19624.48s)]
*  Change. [[05:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19627.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[05:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19628.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[05:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19630.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[05:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19632.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[05:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19635.48s)]
*  We need change. [[05:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19647.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[05:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19649.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[05:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19652.48s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. [[05:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19657.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? [[05:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19659.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[05:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19660.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[05:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19661.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. [[05:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19662.48s)]
*  Dr. Ellis is here. [[05:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19670.48s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[05:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19672.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[05:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19674.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Luttreau, and Chris D'Avraman. [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19680.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[05:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19686.48s)]
*  After this lost Liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[05:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19689.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[05:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19695.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[05:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19697.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[05:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19699.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[05:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19702.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[05:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19707.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[05:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19709.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[05:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19715.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[05:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19724.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[05:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19729.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[05:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19737.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[05:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19742.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[05:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19748.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[05:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19754.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[05:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19761.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[05:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19765.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[05:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19768.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the cost and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[05:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19773.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[05:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19778.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[05:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19786.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[05:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19791.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[05:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19799.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[05:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19803.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[05:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19808.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[05:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19812.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[05:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19820.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19829.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[05:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19836.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[05:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19846.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[05:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19856.48s)]
*  Even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19859.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[05:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19867.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[05:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19874.48s)]
*  This in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[05:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19885.48s)]
*  but the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[05:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19897.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint, [[05:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19908.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[05:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19919.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[05:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19924.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[05:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19935.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[05:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19943.48s)]
*  They're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[05:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19952.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[05:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19958.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said what you were describing is Canada today, the desperation that many people already feel, [[05:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19965.48s)]
*  a desperation that gets worse and worse after 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[05:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19974.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[05:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19981.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[05:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19986.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[05:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=19993.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[05:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20006.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[05:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20014.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[05:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20021.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[05:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20029.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[05:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20037.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[05:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20046.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[05:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20052.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[05:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20062.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[05:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20068.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[05:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20082.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[05:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20089.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[05:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20099.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20107.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[05:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20116.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[05:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20122.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[05:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20131.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[05:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20137.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[05:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20146.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[05:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20152.48s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20165.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[05:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20176.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[05:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20181.48s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[05:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20187.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20197.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. [[05:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20206.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, [[05:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20214.48s)]
*  believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost our economy $138 billion. [[05:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20220.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[05:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20232.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[05:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20236.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[05:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20245.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[05:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20252.48s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[05:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20259.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[05:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20276.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[05:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20288.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[05:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20295.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[05:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20299.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables to phase out internal combustion engines. These measures are critical, he says. [[05:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20305.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, [[05:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20313.48s)]
*  but that ban is phased in starting next year. In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[05:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20322.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[05:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20331.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[05:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20338.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers, [[05:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20345.48s)]
*  this at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[05:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20350.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20356.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[05:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20362.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[05:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20367.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[05:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20373.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[05:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20377.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[05:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20393.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[05:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20399.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[05:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20406.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[05:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20410.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[05:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20415.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[05:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20421.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[05:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20436.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[05:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20443.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[05:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20450.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[05:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20459.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[05:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20463.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[05:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20468.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[05:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20473.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[05:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20479.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[05:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20484.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made [[05:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20491.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[05:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20499.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[05:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20505.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[05:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20511.48s)]
*  It's over with the tax on the electric cars. It's over with the permanent prohibitions on the cars you like and don't depend on. [[05:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20522.48s)]
*  Be clear. If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[05:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20534.48s)]
*  It's a personal choice that we respect. But we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[05:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20540.48s)]
*  It's a personal choice. But in the regions, people need cars. [[05:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20548.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the auto sector, the Liberals and the Bloc. [[05:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20554.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[05:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20561.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. [[05:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20564.48s)]
*  They need a car with petrol and diesel. [[05:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20570.48s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20576.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, [[05:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20585.48s)]
*  or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[05:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20592.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles because we respect the contracts. [[05:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20596.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[05:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20626.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[05:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20632.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[05:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20640.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[05:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20651.48s)]
*  We will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[05:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20656.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[05:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20662.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[05:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20669.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[05:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20676.48s)]
*  It cannot be more clear. [[05:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20679.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect the Liberals for a fourth term [[05:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20681.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[05:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20688.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[05:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20693.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[05:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20703.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[05:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20711.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20715.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20724.48s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home on a safe street under our proud flag. [[05:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20730.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[05:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20740.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20745.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[05:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20753.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[05:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20757.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[05:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20762.48s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[05:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20768.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[05:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20775.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[05:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20782.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. [[05:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20785.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[05:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20794.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[05:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20798.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[05:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20808.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[05:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20817.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[05:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20825.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[05:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20831.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20835.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[05:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20840.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[05:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20849.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[05:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20854.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20865.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. Change so that people have hope again. [[05:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20872.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[05:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20879.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[05:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20886.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[05:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20894.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost liberals, people have lost hope. They are more divided than ever. [[05:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20924.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. It has to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[05:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20933.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. Thank you very much. [[05:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20942.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20954.48s)]
*  Mr. Speaker, I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Speaker of the House of Representatives for the campaign. [[05:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20956.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[05:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20961.48s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. [[05:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20968.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20975.48s)]
*  I'm sure all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia never leave. It's an incredible honour to be back. [[05:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20981.48s)]
*  What I'm hearing is that people want change. They want change. [[05:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20988.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[05:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20992.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[05:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=20998.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[05:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21004.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[05:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21009.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[05:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21015.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. Change to put Canada first. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21021.48s)]
*  That is our mission. We're here with a plan to deliver that change. A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[05:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21025.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[05:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21033.48s)]
*  It will act the federal sales tax on new homes. [[05:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21039.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[05:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21042.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[05:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21047.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[05:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21056.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[05:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21060.48s)]
*  In French. [[05:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21064.48s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. [[05:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21071.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's a very beautiful province. [[05:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21073.48s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21082.48s)]
*  People need change. [[05:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21085.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[05:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21088.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded. [[05:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21093.48s)]
*  37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[05:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21097.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[05:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21102.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[05:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21110.48s)]
*  After the lost destiny of the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, it needs to change. [[05:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21113.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[05:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21120.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, cut tax cuts, [[05:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21123.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21131.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of New York. Thank you very much. [[05:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21141.48s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21145.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[05:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21149.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[05:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21152.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[05:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21153.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[05:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21160.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[05:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21163.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[05:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21172.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[05:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21179.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[05:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21182.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[05:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21187.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. [[05:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21190.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax, [[05:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21196.48s)]
*  how are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? [[05:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21201.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[05:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21205.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21211.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[05:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21216.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[05:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21219.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[05:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21227.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[05:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21231.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[05:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21237.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[05:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21239.48s)]
*  If you vote conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[05:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21247.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[05:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21254.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[05:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21260.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[05:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21262.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[05:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21265.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21270.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[05:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21278.48s)]
*  It is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars and trucks. [[05:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21288.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[05:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21300.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who cannot afford to pay. [[05:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21307.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they cannot afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[05:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21314.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It's impossible. [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21326.48s)]
*  On the contrary, conservatives will put an end to the tax on motor vehicles proposed by liberals, [[05:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21332.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[05:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21340.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[05:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21343.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[05:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21352.48s)]
*  With the Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[05:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21358.48s)]
*  That is the choice. [[05:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21369.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals will increase prices for everything, [[05:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21370.48s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives that will cut waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[05:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21375.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21382.48s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[05:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21384.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[05:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21387.48s)]
*  Hello. [[05:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21391.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken of the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[05:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21392.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussions. [[05:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21398.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[05:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21404.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. I wasn't there. [[05:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21408.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[05:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21412.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[05:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21416.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[05:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21422.48s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[05:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21425.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[05:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21430.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[05:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21433.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[05:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21443.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to the Americans at low prices. [[05:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21452.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[05:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21459.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of the Liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[05:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21466.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[05:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21476.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[05:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21480.48s)]
*  Free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[05:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21488.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[05:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21493.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[05:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21510.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[05:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21513.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take. [[05:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21515.48s)]
*  Which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[05:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21523.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[05:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21527.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[05:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21531.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[05:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21537.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[05:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21549.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[05:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21554.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[05:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21562.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21569.48s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[05:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21571.48s)]

*  and build our economic strength to make change. [[05:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21586.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[05:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21593.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[05:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21597.48s)]
*  Change. [[06:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21600.48s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[06:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21601.48s)]

*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[06:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21606.48s)]

*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[06:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21638.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[06:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21641.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[06:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21649.48s)]
*  We need change. [[06:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21653.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[06:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21655.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[06:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21658.48s)]
*  We have – is Rick Perkins here? [[06:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21662.48s)]
*  Where's Rick? [[06:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21664.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[06:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21665.48s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[06:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21666.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. [[06:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21673.48s)]
*  Dr. Ellis is here. [[06:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21675.48s)]
*  Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[06:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21677.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[06:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21682.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Dalton. [[06:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21685.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[06:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21691.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[06:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21694.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. [[06:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21700.48s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[06:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21702.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[06:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21704.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[06:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21708.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[06:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21713.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent, [[06:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21715.48s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. [[06:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21721.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[06:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21726.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[06:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21729.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[06:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21734.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[06:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21742.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[06:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21747.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[06:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21754.48s)]
*  liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[06:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21759.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[06:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21767.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[06:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21770.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[06:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21774.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[06:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21779.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[06:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21784.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[06:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21792.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published [[06:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21797.48s)]
*  about how the future looks. They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[06:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21802.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[06:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21808.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade. [[06:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21813.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[06:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21818.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[06:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21822.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[06:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21827.48s)]
*  and not through hard work. It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[06:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21834.48s)]
*  that property ownership and, by extension, wealth may become even more concentrated [[06:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21842.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[06:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21848.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[06:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21852.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[06:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21857.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[06:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21862.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable [[06:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21865.48s)]
*  and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[06:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21872.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[06:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21877.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[06:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21880.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[06:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21890.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[06:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21896.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[06:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21902.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[06:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21909.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[06:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21913.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[06:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21918.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[06:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21925.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 [[06:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21929.48s)]
*  will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[06:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21936.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[06:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21940.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[06:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21945.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[06:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21949.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[06:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21958.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21963.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, many people in the crowd said, [[06:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21967.48s)]
*  what you were describing is Canada today. [[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21973.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[06:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21976.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal Government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[06:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21982.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[06:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21986.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[06:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21992.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[06:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=21996.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate. [[06:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22000.48s)]
*  Or, let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[06:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22006.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[06:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22013.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[06:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22018.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[06:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22023.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[06:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22028.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[06:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22036.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[06:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22039.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[06:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22043.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[06:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22052.48s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered cars. [[06:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22057.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[06:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22061.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on. [[06:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22067.48s)]
*  It's not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, [[06:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22074.48s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[06:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22083.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada. [[06:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22088.48s)]
*  A country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[06:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22091.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[06:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22095.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[06:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22099.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[06:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22104.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[06:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22112.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[06:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22121.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[06:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22127.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[06:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22136.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[06:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22142.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[06:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22151.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[06:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22158.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[06:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22160.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[06:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22168.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[06:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22174.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[06:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22181.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[06:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22186.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[06:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22189.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[06:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22197.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[06:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22202.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[06:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22206.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheck. [[06:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22212.48s)]
*  And it's a direct hit to our workers in the automotive sector. [[06:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22217.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[06:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22222.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[06:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22232.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[06:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22237.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[06:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22239.48s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22242.48s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[06:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22246.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, or another route in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[06:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22281.48s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[06:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22293.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[06:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22297.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[06:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22300.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[06:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22305.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[06:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22310.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[06:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22316.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[06:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22318.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[06:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22321.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[06:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22328.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[06:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22332.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[06:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22334.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[06:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22336.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[06:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22343.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[06:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22346.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[06:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22351.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[06:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22355.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[06:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22362.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[06:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22368.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[06:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22373.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[06:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22375.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[06:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22379.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[06:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22392.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[06:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22398.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[06:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22404.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[06:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22411.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[06:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22414.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[06:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22416.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[06:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22418.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[06:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22420.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[06:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22426.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[06:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22442.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[06:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22449.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[06:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22450.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[06:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22456.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22465.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[06:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22469.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[06:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22473.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[06:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22477.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[06:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22479.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[06:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22485.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22490.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[06:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22497.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[06:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22505.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[06:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22507.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[06:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22510.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[06:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22516.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[06:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22519.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[06:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22527.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on gasoline cars is over. [[06:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22528.48s)]
*  The permanent restrictions on your favorite cars are over. [[06:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22532.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[06:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22539.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[06:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22545.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[06:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22553.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[06:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22555.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the liberal autos and the bloc. [[06:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22560.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[06:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22566.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[06:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22569.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[06:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22575.48s)]
*  In Quebec, we will support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and trams. [[06:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22581.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberal autos and the bloc, [[06:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22591.48s)]
*  which simply wants a tramway, or the Conservatives, which favor a third link. [[06:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22595.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories, [[06:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22602.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[06:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22608.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[06:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22611.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[06:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22614.48s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[06:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22618.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[06:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22622.48s)]
*  No more carney tax. No more carney quotas. [[06:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22627.48s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[06:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22630.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[06:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22634.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[06:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22638.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[06:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22643.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes [[06:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22646.48s)]
*  and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[06:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22649.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[06:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22653.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[06:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22657.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[06:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22662.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[06:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22668.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[06:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22674.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It cannot be more clear. [[06:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22681.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[06:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22686.48s)]
*  are we going to elect the Liberals for a fourth term [[06:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22690.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[06:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22693.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[06:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22699.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[06:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22703.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[06:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22708.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[06:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22711.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[06:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22717.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[06:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22721.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[06:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22729.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[06:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22734.48s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[06:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22737.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[06:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22746.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22753.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[06:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22759.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[06:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22765.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[06:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22768.48s)]
*  are telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[06:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22772.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[06:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22776.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[06:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22781.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[06:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22788.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[06:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22791.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[06:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22797.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[06:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22800.48s)]
*  And you know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from. [[06:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22803.48s)]
*  It matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[06:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22812.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for – your family's been here for six generations, or if you've been here for six weeks. [[06:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22817.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[06:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22823.48s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[06:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22826.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[06:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22830.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[06:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22836.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[06:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22841.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[06:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22846.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[06:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22855.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[06:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22860.48s)]
*  Enfants. [[06:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22868.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[06:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22874.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[06:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22878.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. Something that has been lost these last few years. [[06:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22882.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[06:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22888.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[06:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22892.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate you love. [[06:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22896.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[06:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22901.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[06:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22904.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada, that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[06:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22908.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[06:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22917.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[06:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22925.48s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[06:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22930.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[06:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22936.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth Liberal mandate. [[06:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22939.48s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[06:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22941.48s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. Thank you very much. [[06:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22948.48s)]
*  Next question. [[06:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22954.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[06:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22955.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[06:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22958.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[06:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22960.48s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. [[06:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22967.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[06:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22973.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22976.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[06:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22982.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[06:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22990.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[06:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22994.48s)]
*  They want change. After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[06:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=22997.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[06:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23004.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[06:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23009.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[06:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23014.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[06:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23020.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. Change to put Canada first. [[06:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23026.48s)]
*  That is our mission. We're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[06:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23030.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[06:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23034.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[06:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23038.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[06:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23044.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[06:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23047.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[06:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23052.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[06:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23062.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[06:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23066.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23070.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23072.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23074.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[06:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23076.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[06:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23080.48s)]
*  And it's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. [[06:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23082.48s)]
*  People need change. [[06:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23086.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[06:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23088.48s)]
*  The cost of food has increased. [[06:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23094.48s)]
*  37% more quickly here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[06:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23098.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[06:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23104.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[06:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23110.48s)]
*  After the lost decade of the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, it needs to change. [[06:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23114.48s)]
*  We can't afford a four-year period of poverty. [[06:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23120.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, cut tax and tax, [[06:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23124.48s)]
*  free housing construction and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[06:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23130.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. Thank you very much. [[06:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23138.48s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[06:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23142.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[06:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23144.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[06:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23148.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[06:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23156.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute, [[06:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23158.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[06:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23164.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[06:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23172.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[06:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23174.48s)]
*  he wants to take them into account. [[06:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23180.48s)]
*  He wants to take them into account. [[06:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23182.48s)]
*  He wants to take them into account. [[06:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23184.48s)]
*  He wants to take them into account. [[06:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23186.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[06:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23188.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[06:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23192.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. [[06:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23195.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[06:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23201.48s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[06:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23205.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[06:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23208.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[06:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23210.48s)]
*  I will axe that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[06:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23217.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[06:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23222.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[06:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23225.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[06:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23233.48s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[06:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23237.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[06:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23243.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[06:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23245.48s)]
*  If you vote conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[06:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23253.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[06:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23260.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[06:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23266.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[06:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23267.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[06:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23271.48s)]
*  In French? [[06:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23275.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23281.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[06:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23283.48s)]
*  It is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tariff war that is responsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[06:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23293.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers in the automotive industry, [[06:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23303.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[06:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23313.48s)]
*  How can it be that when someone has to replace their car, [[06:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23319.48s)]
*  but they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[06:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23325.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[06:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23331.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[06:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23335.48s)]
*  On the contrary, conservatives will end the tax on motor vehicles proposed by liberals, [[06:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23337.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[06:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23345.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the tax on motor vehicles made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[06:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23348.48s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for cars with gasoline. [[06:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23357.48s)]
*  With the Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[06:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23363.48s)]
*  That is the choice. [[06:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23374.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals that will increase prices for everything, [[06:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23375.48s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives that will cut waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[06:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23380.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23387.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23389.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[06:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23390.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[06:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23393.48s)]
*  Hello. [[06:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23396.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken of the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[06:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23397.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussion. [[06:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23403.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[06:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23409.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[06:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23413.48s)]
*  I was not there. [[06:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23415.48s)]
*  It is clear that Mr. Carney must explain this. [[06:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23417.48s)]
*  I was not on the call, but I will say that Canada will never be an American state. [[06:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23421.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[06:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23427.48s)]
*  And that means that we must concentrate on what we can control. [[06:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23430.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[06:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23435.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[06:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23438.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. [[06:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23448.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[06:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23457.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[06:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23464.48s)]
*  Because after a decade lost of liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[06:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23471.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[06:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23482.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[06:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23486.48s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[06:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23494.48s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[06:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23499.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[06:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23505.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[06:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23507.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[06:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23510.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[06:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23512.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[06:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23514.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[06:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23515.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[06:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23518.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[06:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23520.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[06:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23525.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[06:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23532.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[06:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23536.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[06:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23542.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[06:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23555.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, [[06:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23560.48s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[06:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23568.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23575.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[06:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23576.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[06:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23582.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, [[06:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23585.48s)]
*  build housing, free our natural resources, and rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[06:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23592.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[06:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23602.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[06:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23606.48s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[06:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23609.48s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets after the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime. [[06:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23614.48s)]
*  And a falling economy under America's thumb. [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23621.48s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[06:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23625.48s)]
*  We need change. [[06:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23629.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[06:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23631.48s)]
*  Today, we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[06:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23634.48s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[06:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23638.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[06:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23643.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[06:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23658.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Stuckerman. [[06:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23661.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[06:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23666.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[06:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23670.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[06:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23676.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[06:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23680.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[06:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23684.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[06:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23689.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[06:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23691.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[06:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23697.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[06:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23706.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[06:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23711.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[06:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23719.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[06:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23724.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[06:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23730.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[06:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23736.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[06:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23743.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[06:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23746.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[06:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23750.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[06:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23755.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[06:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23760.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[06:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23768.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[06:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23773.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[06:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23781.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[06:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23785.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[06:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23790.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[06:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23794.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[06:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23802.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[06:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23811.48s)]
*  that property ownership and, by extension, wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[06:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23817.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[06:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23828.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[06:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23838.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[06:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23841.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[06:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23849.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[06:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23856.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[06:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23866.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[06:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23879.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[06:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23889.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[06:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23905.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[06:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23921.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[06:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23925.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[06:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23934.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[06:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23939.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse after 10 years of liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[06:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23952.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[06:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23968.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[06:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23976.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of liberals, sell too many gas powered vehicles. [[06:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23989.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[06:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=23999.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[06:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24012.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the liberals are re-elected. [[06:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24019.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of liberals, sell too many gas powered cars. [[06:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24028.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government imposed quota, they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[06:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24037.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas powered or hybrid. [[06:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24050.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[06:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24064.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out of touch bankers and liberal ideologues, [[06:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24076.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[06:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24089.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the auto workers. [[06:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24098.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[06:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24104.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[06:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24119.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[06:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24128.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[06:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24136.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[06:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24150.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[06:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24157.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[06:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24163.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus seven and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[06:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24173.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[06:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24182.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. [[06:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24188.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, estimate that this ban could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[06:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24196.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[06:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24208.48s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[06:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24218.48s)]
*  Of course, that's because their economic policies send our jobs straight to their country. [[06:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24226.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[06:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24234.48s)]
*  And that number comes from studies that have been done between minus seven and minus 15. [[06:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24248.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[06:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24257.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24269.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[06:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24276.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[06:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24281.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[06:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24292.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[06:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24298.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[06:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24308.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24313.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[06:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24323.48s)]
*  We're going to face this at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[06:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24332.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24339.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[06:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24345.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[06:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24350.48s)]
*  The Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[06:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24356.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We'll axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[06:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24372.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[06:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24381.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[06:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24387.48s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[06:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24392.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada. [[06:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24397.48s)]
*  So that you can save by buying Canadian. [[06:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24408.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[06:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24418.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24425.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[06:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24432.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[06:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24445.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[06:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24453.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[06:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24461.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[06:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24466.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[06:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24473.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[06:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24483.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing the GST on those purchases. [[06:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24487.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[06:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24496.48s)]
*  The tax cuts are over. The $20,000 tax on gas cars is over. [[06:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24503.48s)]
*  The permanent bans on cars you like and you depend on are over. [[06:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24509.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[06:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24516.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. But we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[06:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24522.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. But in the regions, people need their cars. [[06:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24530.48s)]
*  I will end the war against automobiles, liberals and the bloc. [[06:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24536.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[06:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24543.48s)]
*  People in Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[06:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24546.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[06:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24552.48s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and tramways. [[06:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24558.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberals and the bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[06:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24567.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles, because we respect the contracts. [[06:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24578.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so that your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[06:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24597.48s)]
*  We will act the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to invest in new homes. [[06:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24607.48s)]
*  We will make sure that the government does not lose its control over the economy. [[06:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24615.48s)]
*  We will cut the cost of housing by $100,000. [[06:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24621.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[06:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24626.48s)]
*  We will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[06:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24632.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[06:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24639.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[06:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24646.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[06:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24654.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term, [[06:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24659.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[06:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24666.48s)]
*  Or do we want change, with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[06:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24672.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[06:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24681.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[06:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24690.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[06:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24695.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[06:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24702.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, [[06:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24707.48s)]
*  on a safe street under our proud flag. [[06:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24715.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now let's bring it home. [[06:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24718.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24722.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24724.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[06:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24726.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[06:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24733.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[06:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24737.48s)]
*  have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[06:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24741.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[06:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24746.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[06:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24751.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[06:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24758.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last few weeks. [[06:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24761.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[06:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24766.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. [[06:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24772.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[06:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24777.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, [[06:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24780.48s)]
*  it matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[06:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24788.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[06:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24793.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[06:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24800.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[06:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24807.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[06:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24813.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[06:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24817.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[06:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24822.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[06:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24831.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[06:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24836.48s)]
*  Al-Ponse. [[06:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24844.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, that the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[06:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24850.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[06:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24854.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. Something that has been lost these last few years. [[06:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24858.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[06:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24864.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[06:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24868.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate you love. [[06:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24872.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[06:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24877.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[06:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24879.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a nice house on a safe street. [[06:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24884.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[06:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24893.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[06:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24901.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. [[06:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24906.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[06:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24912.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[06:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24915.48s)]
*  We need change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[06:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24917.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[06:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24924.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24929.48s)]
*  Next question. [[06:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24930.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[06:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24931.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[06:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24934.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[06:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24936.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24943.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[06:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24944.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[06:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24948.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[06:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24950.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[06:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24958.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[06:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24966.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[06:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24970.48s)]
*  They want change. [[06:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24973.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[06:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24974.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[06:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24980.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[06:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24985.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[06:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24990.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[06:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24996.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=24999.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[06:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25002.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[06:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25004.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[06:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25006.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25007.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[06:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25010.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[06:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25014.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[06:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25020.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[06:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25023.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[06:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25028.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[06:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25038.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[06:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25042.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[06:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25043.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25044.48s)]
*  In French. [[06:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25046.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25053.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25054.48s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[06:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25055.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[06:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25062.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[06:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25064.48s)]
*  People need change. [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25067.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[06:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25070.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[06:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25075.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[06:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25084.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[06:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25092.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime are increasing. [[06:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25095.48s)]
*  It needs to change. [[06:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25100.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[06:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25102.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[06:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25104.48s)]
*  free the construction of housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[06:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25112.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[06:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25123.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25126.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25127.48s)]
*  Next question. [[06:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25128.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[06:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25131.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[06:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25132.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[06:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25133.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[06:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25134.48s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[06:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25135.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[06:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25141.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[06:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25145.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[06:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25154.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[06:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25161.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[06:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25164.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[06:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25169.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[06:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25171.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax. [[06:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25177.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[06:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25183.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[06:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25185.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[06:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25187.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[06:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25193.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[06:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25198.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[07:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25201.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[07:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25209.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[07:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25213.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[07:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25219.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[07:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25221.48s)]
*  If you vote conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[07:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25229.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[07:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25236.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[07:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25242.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[07:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25243.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[07:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25247.48s)]
*  In French. [[07:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25251.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25257.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[07:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25259.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tariff war that would cost $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel. [[07:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25269.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[07:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25282.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[07:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25289.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[07:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25295.48s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It's impossible. [[07:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25307.48s)]
*  On the contrary, conservatives will end the tax on motorists proposed by liberals, [[07:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25313.48s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[07:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25321.48s)]
*  We will eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[07:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25324.48s)]
*  So the choice with the liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[07:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25333.48s)]
*  With conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[07:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25339.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25350.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the liberals that will increase prices for everything, [[07:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25352.48s)]
*  or a change with conservatives that will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[07:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25356.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25364.48s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[07:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25366.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[07:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25369.48s)]
*  Hello. [[07:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25373.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president spoke about the 51st method in his call with Mark Carney, [[07:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25374.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister told us that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25379.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[07:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25385.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. I wasn't there. [[07:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25390.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[07:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25394.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[07:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25398.48s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[07:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25403.48s)]
*  And that means focusing on what we can control. [[07:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25407.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[07:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25413.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[07:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25415.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[07:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25425.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[07:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25434.48s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[07:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25442.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of loss of the Liberals, which has increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[07:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25448.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[07:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25459.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut gaspillage, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[07:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25463.48s)]
*  We must stop the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[07:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25471.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in control. [[07:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25475.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[07:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25482.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[07:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25484.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[07:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25486.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. I wasn't there. [[07:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25488.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[07:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25491.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[07:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25494.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[07:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25496.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[07:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25501.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[07:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25508.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[07:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25518.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[07:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25531.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy. [[07:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25536.48s)]
*  So that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[07:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25544.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25551.48s)]
*  Thank you everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[07:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25553.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[07:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25574.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[07:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25582.48s)]
*  Change that you're once again safe on your streets. [[07:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25590.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[07:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25593.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. We need change. [[07:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25601.48s)]
*  And that is what conservatives will bring. [[07:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25607.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[07:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25610.48s)]
*  We have, is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[07:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25614.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[07:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25619.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris Dalgama. [[07:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25630.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[07:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25642.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[07:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25646.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[07:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25652.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[07:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25656.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[07:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25660.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[07:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25665.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy. [[07:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25667.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[07:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25678.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[07:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25687.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[07:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25695.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[07:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25706.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. More expensive food, homes and cars. [[07:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25716.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[07:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25722.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[07:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25726.48s)]
*  with inflation driving up the cost and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[07:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25731.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[07:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25736.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[07:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25744.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[07:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25749.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[07:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25757.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[07:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25761.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade, it's about how miserable life will become [[07:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25766.48s)]
*  and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the liberals have created for us. [[07:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25773.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[07:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25779.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[07:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25788.48s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[07:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25794.48s)]
*  If younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings, [[07:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25800.48s)]
*  we see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[07:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25804.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country and even more so, and more shockingly so, [[07:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25814.48s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[07:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25821.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[07:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25826.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[07:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25832.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[07:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25842.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[07:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25849.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[07:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25855.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[07:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25861.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[07:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25865.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[07:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25870.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[07:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25877.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[07:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25881.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict [[07:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25890.48s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[07:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25897.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[07:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25901.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[07:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25910.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[07:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25915.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said what you were describing is Canada today, [[07:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25923.48s)]
*  the desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[07:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25928.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[07:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25934.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25938.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[07:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25944.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[07:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25948.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[07:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25952.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[07:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25959.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[07:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25965.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[07:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25972.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[07:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25975.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[07:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25980.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[07:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25988.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[07:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25992.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[07:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25995.48s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[07:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=25998.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[07:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26004.48s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[07:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26010.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[07:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26013.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[07:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26020.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, [[07:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26026.48s)]
*  it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[07:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26031.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[07:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26041.48s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[07:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26044.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[07:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26048.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[07:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26052.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[07:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26057.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, [[07:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26065.48s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[07:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26070.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[07:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26074.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[07:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26080.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[07:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26089.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[07:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26095.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[07:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26104.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[07:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26106.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[07:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26112.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[07:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26121.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[07:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26126.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[07:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26133.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[07:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26139.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[07:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26142.48s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[07:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26149.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[07:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26155.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[07:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26158.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[07:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26164.48s)]
*  And it strikes directly. [[07:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26169.48s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, [[07:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26172.48s)]
*  I believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[07:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26178.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[07:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26185.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[07:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26190.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[07:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26192.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[07:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26195.48s)]
*  And the reason why we're not going to the US is because we're not going to the US. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26203.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26208.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26210.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26212.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26214.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26216.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26218.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26220.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26222.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26224.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26226.48s)]
*  We're going to the US. [[07:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26228.48s)]
*  Between minus 7 and minus 15 degrees. [[07:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26230.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, or another route in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25 degrees. [[07:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26234.48s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[07:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26246.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[07:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26250.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[07:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26253.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[07:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26257.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[07:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26268.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[07:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26271.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[07:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26274.48s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[07:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26280.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[07:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26284.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[07:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26287.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[07:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26289.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[07:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26299.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[07:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26308.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[07:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26314.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[07:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26320.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[07:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26325.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[07:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26327.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[07:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26331.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[07:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26338.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[07:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26351.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[07:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26357.48s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[07:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26364.48s)]
*  Want one? Buy one. Free choice. Make your own decision. [[07:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26367.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[07:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26371.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[07:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26373.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[07:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26379.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[07:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26387.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[07:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26401.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[07:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26403.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[07:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26408.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[07:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26418.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[07:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26422.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[07:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26426.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[07:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26429.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[07:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26432.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made, [[07:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26437.48s)]
*  but we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[07:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26442.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[07:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26449.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[07:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26457.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[07:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26460.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles [[07:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26463.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[07:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26469.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[07:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26472.48s)]
*  The tax cuts are over. [[07:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26479.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on cars with gasoline is over. [[07:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26481.48s)]
*  The permanent restrictions on cars you like and don't depend on are over. [[07:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26485.48s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[07:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26492.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[07:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26498.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[07:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26506.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[07:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26508.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the auto sector, the Liberals and the Bloc. [[07:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26512.48s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[07:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26519.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[07:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26522.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[07:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26528.48s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and trams. [[07:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26534.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, [[07:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26543.48s)]
*  who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[07:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26547.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicle factories [[07:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26554.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[07:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26560.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[07:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26563.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living [[07:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26566.48s)]
*  and drive our jobs out. [[07:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26572.48s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[07:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26574.48s)]
*  No more carney tax. No more carney quotas. [[07:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26579.48s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[07:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26582.48s)]
*  We won't stop there. [[07:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26586.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[07:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26587.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[07:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26590.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[07:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26595.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[07:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26598.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[07:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26605.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[07:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26609.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[07:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26614.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[07:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26620.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[07:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26626.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[07:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26633.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[07:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26636.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[07:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26638.48s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[07:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26642.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[07:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26645.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[07:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26651.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[07:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26655.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[07:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26660.48s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[07:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26663.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[07:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26669.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills, and now automobile bills. [[07:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26673.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[07:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26682.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[07:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26687.48s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[07:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26690.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[07:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26698.48s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[07:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26701.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26703.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26705.48s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[07:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26707.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[07:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26711.48s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[07:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26714.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[07:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26717.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[07:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26721.48s)]
*  have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government. [[07:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26724.48s)]
*  The Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[07:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26729.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[07:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26733.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[07:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26740.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[07:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26743.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[07:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26749.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[07:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26752.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[07:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26754.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise. [[07:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26757.48s)]
*  That it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[07:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26762.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[07:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26766.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations, or if you've been here for six weeks. [[07:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26769.48s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[07:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26776.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[07:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26784.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[07:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26789.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[07:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26792.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[07:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26794.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[07:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26799.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[07:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26801.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[07:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26807.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[07:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26812.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26818.48s)]
*  Alphonse. [[07:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26819.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26821.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[07:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26822.48s)]
*  We need change. [[07:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26830.48s)]
*  We need change now more than ever. [[07:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26832.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[07:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26834.48s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[07:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26836.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[07:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26840.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[07:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26844.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. [[07:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26848.48s)]
*  Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[07:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26850.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[07:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26852.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[07:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26854.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[07:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26856.48s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful home on a safe street. [[07:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26860.48s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[07:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26869.48s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians around Canada. [[07:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26877.48s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. [[07:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26882.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[07:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26888.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[07:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26891.48s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a difference. [[07:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26893.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26905.48s)]
*  Next question. [[07:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26907.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[07:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26908.48s)]
*  Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[07:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26909.48s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[07:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26911.48s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[07:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26913.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26920.48s)]
*  It's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[07:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26921.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[07:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26924.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26926.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[07:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26934.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[07:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26942.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[07:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26946.48s)]
*  They want change. [[07:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26949.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[07:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26950.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[07:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26956.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[07:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26962.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[07:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26966.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[07:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26972.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[07:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26976.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[07:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26978.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[07:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26980.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[07:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26982.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[07:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26984.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[07:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26987.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[07:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26990.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[07:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=26997.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[07:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27000.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[07:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27005.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[07:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27011.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[07:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27014.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[07:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27018.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[07:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27019.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27021.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27022.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27029.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27030.48s)]
*  It's a... [[07:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27031.48s)]
*  There's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[07:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27033.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[07:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27038.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[07:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27040.48s)]
*  People need change. [[07:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27044.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[07:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27046.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada [[07:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27052.48s)]
*  than in the United States in the last five years. [[07:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27058.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax [[07:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27061.48s)]
*  more than in any other city across Canada. [[07:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27064.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[07:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27069.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime that are increasing, [[07:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27072.48s)]
*  it needs to change. [[07:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27077.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[07:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27079.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government [[07:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27081.48s)]
*  that will cut waste, cut tax aid, [[07:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27085.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources [[07:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27089.48s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[07:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27095.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[07:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27099.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27102.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27103.48s)]
*  Next question. [[07:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27104.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. [[07:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27107.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[07:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27109.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[07:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27110.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[07:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27111.48s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, [[07:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27112.48s)]
*  given the high levels of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[07:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27113.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[07:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27117.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[07:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27120.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[07:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27123.48s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[07:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27129.48s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[07:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27132.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[07:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27140.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[07:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27145.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[07:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27148.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down [[07:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27154.48s)]
*  and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax. [[07:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27156.48s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[07:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27160.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[07:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27161.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[07:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27163.48s)]
*  when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[07:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27165.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[07:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27169.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[07:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27174.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[07:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27177.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[07:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27181.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[07:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27185.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[07:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27189.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[07:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27195.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth Liberal term, [[07:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27197.48s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[07:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27199.48s)]
*  If you vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle [[07:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27205.48s)]
*  that is made in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs [[07:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27211.48s)]
*  for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[07:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27215.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[07:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27218.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[07:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27219.48s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[07:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27221.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[07:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27223.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27227.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27228.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[07:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27236.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[07:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27242.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney, [[07:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27246.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel. [[07:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27249.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[07:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27258.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can't pay. [[07:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27265.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[07:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27271.48s)]
*  when they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[07:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27278.48s)]
*  What will they do to get jobs? [[07:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27284.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[07:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27288.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will end the tax on automobiles [[07:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27290.48s)]
*  proposed by the Liberals, and we'll do differently. [[07:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27296.48s)]
*  We'll eliminate the tax on cars made in Canada [[07:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27300.48s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs back to Canada. [[07:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27305.48s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, you'll pay a tax of $20,000 [[07:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27310.48s)]
*  for gas-powered cars. [[07:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27314.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you'll pay less, no TPS [[07:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27316.48s)]
*  on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[07:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27322.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[07:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27327.48s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, [[07:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27328.48s)]
*  which will increase prices for everything, [[07:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27330.48s)]
*  or change with Conservatives, [[07:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27333.48s)]
*  which will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes, and make life more affordable. [[07:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27335.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27340.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27342.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[07:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27343.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[07:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27346.48s)]
*  Hello. [[07:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27349.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st State [[07:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27350.48s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney, [[07:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27353.48s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had said that Trump had respected [[07:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27355.48s)]
*  Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[07:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27359.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[07:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27362.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[07:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27366.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[07:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27368.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[07:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27370.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada [[07:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27374.48s)]
*  would never be an American state. [[07:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27377.48s)]
*  We have to defend our sovereignty. [[07:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27380.48s)]
*  And that means we have to concentrate on what we can control. [[07:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27383.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[07:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27389.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies [[07:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27391.48s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[07:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27396.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts, and inflation, [[07:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27401.48s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. [[07:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27405.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[07:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27410.48s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[07:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27413.48s)]
*  We have to overthrow all liberal policies [[07:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27417.48s)]
*  that have caused this dependence. [[07:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27421.48s)]
*  Because after a decade of liberalism that has increased the cost [[07:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27424.48s)]
*  and made our economy fall, [[07:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27430.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[07:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27434.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government [[07:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27438.48s)]
*  that will cut waste, bureaucracy, taxes, and taxes. [[07:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27442.48s)]
*  Free the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[07:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27446.48s)]
*  And bring our jobs here to keep Americans in control. [[07:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27450.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[07:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27457.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[07:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27459.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[07:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27462.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[07:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27464.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[07:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27466.48s)]
*  But what's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[07:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27467.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[07:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27470.48s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, [[07:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27472.48s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[07:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27474.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[07:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27477.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[07:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27480.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[07:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27484.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes, and bringing down the cost of living. [[07:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27488.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[07:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27494.48s)]
*  and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars [[07:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27501.48s)]
*  that Liberals pushed south. [[07:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27505.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[07:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27508.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building, and energy [[07:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27512.48s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[07:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27520.48s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[07:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27523.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27527.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[07:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27529.48s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[07:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27530.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[07:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27535.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government [[07:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27538.48s)]
*  that will reduce taxes and taxes, build housing, [[07:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27542.48s)]
*  and free our natural resources to be able to rebuild our economic strength [[07:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27546.48s)]
*  to make a change. [[07:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27553.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this changed election. [[07:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27555.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[07:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27558.48s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[07:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27561.48s)]
*  Change so that you're once again safe on your streets. [[07:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27566.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[07:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27569.48s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[07:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27574.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[07:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27578.48s)]
*  We need change. [[07:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27582.48s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[07:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27584.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[07:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27586.48s)]
*  We have... Is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[07:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27590.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[07:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27595.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[07:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27606.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris L'Auguin. [[07:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27613.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[07:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27619.48s)]
*  You know, after this lost Liberal decade, [[07:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27622.48s)]
*  we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[07:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27625.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[07:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27628.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[07:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27632.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[07:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27636.48s)]
*  from a position of strength. [[07:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27639.48s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[07:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27641.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[07:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27643.48s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, [[07:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27649.48s)]
*  we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[07:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27654.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[07:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27658.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[07:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27663.48s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[07:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27669.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[07:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27671.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[07:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27676.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[07:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27683.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[07:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27689.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[07:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27693.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[07:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27696.48s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[07:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27699.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[07:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27703.48s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[07:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27706.48s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[07:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27710.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[07:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27713.48s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[07:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27718.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[07:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27721.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report [[07:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27725.48s)]
*  that the government has published about how the future looks. [[07:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27729.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[07:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27733.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[07:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27737.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[07:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27742.48s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[07:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27747.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[07:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27752.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people [[07:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27756.48s)]
*  will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[07:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27760.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[07:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27764.48s)]
*  that property ownership and, by extension, wealth, [[07:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27771.48s)]
*  may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the idea [[07:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27774.48s)]
*  of buying single-family dwellings. [[07:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27779.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[07:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27781.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[07:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27786.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[07:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27791.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that [[07:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27794.48s)]
*  because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[07:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27799.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[07:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27802.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[07:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27806.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[07:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27808.48s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[07:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27813.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[07:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27819.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[07:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27825.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[07:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27831.48s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[07:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27837.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[07:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27841.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[07:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27846.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[07:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27853.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic. [[07:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27858.48s)]
*  An inequality between those who rent and those who own [[07:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27866.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[07:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27869.48s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[07:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27874.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future [[07:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27878.48s)]
*  in this Government of Canada report. [[07:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27885.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[07:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27887.48s)]
*  Now yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia [[07:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27892.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[07:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27896.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[07:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27899.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[07:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27905.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal Government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[07:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27910.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[07:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27915.48s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[07:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27920.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[07:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27924.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate. [[07:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27928.48s)]
*  Or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[07:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27935.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[07:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27941.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[07:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27946.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[07:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27951.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[07:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27956.48s)]
*  Now that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[07:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27964.48s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[07:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27968.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[07:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27971.48s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[07:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27974.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[07:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27980.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[07:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27985.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[07:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27989.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[07:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=27996.48s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[07:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28003.48s)]
*  It's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[07:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28007.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[07:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28017.48s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[07:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28020.48s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[07:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28024.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[07:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28028.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[07:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28033.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, [[07:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28041.48s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[07:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28046.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[07:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28050.48s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[07:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28054.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[07:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28056.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[07:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28065.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[07:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28071.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[07:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28080.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[07:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28082.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[07:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28086.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[07:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28088.48s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28097.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[07:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28103.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[07:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28110.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[07:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28115.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[07:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28118.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[07:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28126.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[07:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28131.48s)]
*  So try and scratch one in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[07:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28134.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[07:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28140.48s)]
*  And it's a direct hit to our workers in the automotive sector. [[07:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28145.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[07:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28151.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[07:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28161.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[07:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28166.48s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[07:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28168.48s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers. [[07:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28171.48s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[07:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28174.48s)]
*  So try and scratch one in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[07:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28210.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[07:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28222.48s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[07:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28226.48s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[07:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28229.48s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, [[07:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28233.48s)]
*  Use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[07:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28235.48s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[07:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28239.48s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[07:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28244.48s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[07:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28247.48s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, [[07:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28250.48s)]
*  but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[07:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28256.48s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[07:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28260.48s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[07:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28263.48s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[07:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28265.48s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[07:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28272.48s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[07:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28275.48s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[07:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28279.48s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness [[07:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28284.48s)]
*  and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[07:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28287.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[07:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28290.48s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[07:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28296.48s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[07:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28301.48s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[07:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28303.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[07:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28307.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[07:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28311.48s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[07:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28314.48s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[07:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28320.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, the current government is not going to be able to do that. [[07:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28327.48s)]
*  It's going to be a new government. [[07:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28332.48s)]
*  It's going to be a new government. [[07:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28334.48s)]
*  No permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[07:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28337.48s)]
*  Let me be clear, I have nothing against electric cars. [[07:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28340.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[07:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28343.48s)]
*  Free choice. [[07:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28345.48s)]
*  Make your own decision. [[07:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28346.48s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[07:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28347.48s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[07:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28349.48s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada [[07:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28355.48s)]
*  so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[07:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28360.48s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada [[07:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28366.48s)]
*  while making automobiles more affordable. [[07:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28373.48s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[07:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28375.48s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[07:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28377.48s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power [[07:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28383.48s)]
*  and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[07:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28386.48s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[07:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28393.48s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[07:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28397.48s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[07:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28402.48s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[07:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28405.48s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[07:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28407.48s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[07:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28413.48s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[07:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28418.48s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, [[07:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28425.48s)]
*  and the other commitments the government has made [[07:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28429.48s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[07:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28433.48s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[07:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28436.48s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives [[07:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28439.48s)]
*  for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles [[07:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28442.48s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[07:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28445.48s)]
*  A Conservative government will remove the tax on vehicles [[07:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28448.48s)]
*  from its first day in power. [[07:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28452.48s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[07:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28455.48s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on gasoline cars is over. [[07:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28457.48s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[07:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28461.48s)]
*  Be clear. [[07:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28467.48s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[07:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28469.48s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. [[07:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28474.48s)]
*  But we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[07:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28478.48s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[07:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28482.48s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[07:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28484.48s)]
*  I will end the war against the auto sector, the Liberals and the Bloc. [[07:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28489.48s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. [[07:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28495.48s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[07:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28498.48s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28504.48s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything [[07:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28510.48s)]
*  in electric cars and trams. [[07:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28515.48s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, [[07:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28519.48s)]
*  who simply want a tramway or the Conservatives who prefer a third link. [[07:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28523.48s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles [[07:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28530.48s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[07:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28535.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[07:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28539.48s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[07:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28542.48s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[07:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28546.48s)]
*  We will make sure that government gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[07:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28550.48s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, [[07:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28556.48s)]
*  no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[07:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28559.48s)]
*  We will not stop there. [[07:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28562.48s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[07:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28564.48s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so that your hard work pays off [[07:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28567.48s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[07:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28571.48s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes [[07:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28575.48s)]
*  and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[07:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28578.48s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[07:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28581.48s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[07:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28585.48s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[07:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28590.48s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[07:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28596.48s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[07:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28603.48s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[07:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28610.48s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[07:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28613.48s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[07:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28615.48s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[07:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28618.48s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[07:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28622.48s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[07:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28627.48s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[07:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28631.48s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, and unleash home building and resources [[07:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28636.48s)]
*  so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[07:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28642.48s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[07:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28645.48s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills, and now automobile bills. [[07:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28649.48s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[07:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28658.48s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[07:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28663.48s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[07:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28666.48s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[07:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28674.48s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[07:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28677.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28681.48s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[07:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28687.48s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from NBS News. [[07:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28693.48s)]
*  The parties, the leaders, for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[07:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28696.48s)]
*  have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[07:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28700.48s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[07:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28705.48s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[07:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28709.48s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[07:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28716.48s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[07:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28719.48s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[07:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28725.48s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[07:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28728.48s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[07:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28730.48s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28733.48s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[07:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28738.48s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[07:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28743.48s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for... your family's been here for six generations, [[07:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28746.48s)]
*  or if you've been here for six weeks, if you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[07:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28750.48s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[07:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28755.48s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[07:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28760.48s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[07:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28765.48s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[07:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28768.48s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[07:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28770.48s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[07:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28775.48s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[07:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28777.48s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[07:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28783.48s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[07:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28788.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28794.48s)]
*  Al-Khansi. [[07:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28796.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28798.48s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[08:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28802.48s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[08:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28806.48s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again, something that has been lost these last few years. [[08:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28810.48s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[08:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28816.48s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[08:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28820.48s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[08:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28824.48s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[08:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28828.48s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[08:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28830.48s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise, the promise of Canada, [[08:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28832.48s)]
*  that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful home on a safe street [[08:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28837.48s)]
*  no matter your origins, modest or above all, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[08:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28845.48s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians around Canada. [[08:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28853.48s)]
*  After the decade lost of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[08:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28858.48s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[08:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28864.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[08:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28867.48s)]
*  We need change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[08:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28870.48s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. [[08:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28876.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28882.48s)]
*  Next question. [[08:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28883.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[08:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28884.48s)]
*  During the final days of the campaign, what made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now [[08:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28887.48s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[08:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28891.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28896.48s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[08:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28897.48s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[08:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28901.48s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[08:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28903.48s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[08:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28911.48s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[08:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28919.48s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[08:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28923.48s)]
*  They want change. [[08:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28925.48s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[08:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28926.48s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[08:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28932.48s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[08:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28938.48s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[08:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28943.48s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[08:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28949.48s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[08:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28952.48s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[08:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28954.48s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[08:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28956.48s)]
*  That is our mission. [[08:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28958.48s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[08:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28960.48s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[08:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28963.48s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[08:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28966.48s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[08:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28973.48s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[08:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28976.48s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[08:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28981.48s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[08:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28987.48s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[08:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28990.48s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[08:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28994.48s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[08:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28995.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28997.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=28998.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29005.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29006.48s)]
*  It's a... [[08:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29007.48s)]
*  There's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[08:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29009.48s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[08:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29014.48s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[08:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29016.48s)]
*  People need change. [[08:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29020.48s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[08:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29023.48s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded. [[08:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29028.48s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city in Canada. [[08:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29032.48s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[08:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29038.48s)]
*  After the lost decade of Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[08:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29041.48s)]
*  it needs to change. [[08:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29047.48s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[08:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29049.48s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut the gap [[08:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29051.48s)]
*  between the federal government and the federal government. [[08:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29056.48s)]
*  A new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, tax cuts, [[08:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29060.48s)]
*  free housing and natural resources, [[08:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29066.48s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[08:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29072.48s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[08:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29076.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29079.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29080.48s)]
*  Next question. [[08:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29081.48s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. [[08:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29084.48s)]
*  Good morning. [[08:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29085.48s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[08:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29086.48s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[08:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29087.48s)]
*  Given the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[08:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29088.48s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[08:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29091.48s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[08:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29094.48s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals [[08:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29097.48s)]
*  and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[08:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29105.48s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[08:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29114.48s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[08:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29117.48s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[08:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29121.48s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. [[08:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29124.48s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[08:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29130.48s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[08:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29134.48s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[08:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29137.48s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, [[08:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29139.48s)]
*  liberal tax, on vehicles? [[08:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29143.48s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[08:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29146.48s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[08:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29151.48s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[08:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29154.48s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[08:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29158.48s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[08:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29161.48s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[08:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29166.48s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[08:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29169.48s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax [[08:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29174.48s)]
*  on your gas-powered automobile. [[08:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29179.48s)]
*  If you vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[08:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29182.48s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[08:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29189.48s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[08:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29195.48s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[08:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29196.48s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[08:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29200.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29203.48s)]
*  In French. [[08:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29204.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29206.48s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[08:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29212.48s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney, during a tariff war, [[08:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29222.48s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 for cars with gasoline and diesel. [[08:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29228.48s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[08:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29235.48s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[08:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29242.48s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[08:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29248.48s)]
*  with a car with gasoline and diesel? [[08:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29254.48s)]
*  But they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax. [[08:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29257.48s)]
*  What will they do to get jobs? [[08:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29262.48s)]
*  It's impossible. [[08:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29266.48s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will put an end to the tax on automobiles proposed by Liberals, [[08:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29268.48s)]
*  and we'll do otherwise. [[08:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29276.48s)]
*  We will put an end to the tax on automobiles made in Canada [[08:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29278.48s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[08:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29282.48s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for cars with gasoline. [[08:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29287.48s)]
*  With Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[08:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29293.48s)]
*  That's the choice. [[08:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29304.48s)]
*  We will put an end to the tax on automobiles proposed by Liberals, [[08:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29305.48s)]
*  which will increase prices for everything, [[08:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29309.48s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives, which will cut waste, [[08:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29312.48s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[08:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29316.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29319.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29321.48s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[08:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29322.48s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[08:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29324.48s)]
*  Hello. [[08:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29328.48s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken of the 51st method [[08:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29329.48s)]
*  Mr. Minister, you said that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussions. [[08:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29333.48s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[08:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29338.48s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[08:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29342.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[08:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29344.48s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[08:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29346.48s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada would never be an American state. [[08:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29350.48s)]
*  We have to defend our sovereignty. [[08:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29356.48s)]
*  And that means we have to concentrate on what we can control. [[08:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29359.48s)]
*  What can we control? [[08:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29364.48s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[08:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29367.48s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, [[08:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29377.48s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[08:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29381.48s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to the Americans at low prices. [[08:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29386.48s)]
*  We have to overthrow all the liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[08:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29393.48s)]
*  Because after a decade lost of liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[08:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29400.48s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[08:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29411.48s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[08:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29415.48s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[08:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29423.48s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[08:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29428.48s)]
*  In English as well? [[08:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29434.48s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[08:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29436.48s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[08:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29439.48s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[08:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29441.48s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[08:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29443.48s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[08:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29444.48s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[08:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29447.48s)]
*  We will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[08:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29449.48s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[08:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29454.48s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[08:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29457.48s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[08:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29461.48s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[08:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29465.48s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources [[08:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29471.48s)]
*  to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[08:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29479.48s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[08:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29484.48s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy [[08:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29489.48s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[08:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29497.48s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[08:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29500.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29504.48s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[08:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29505.48s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[08:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29511.48s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, [[08:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29514.48s)]
*  build housing, free our natural resources, [[08:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29521.48s)]
*  and rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[08:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29524.48s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[08:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29531.48s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[08:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29535.48s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[08:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29538.48s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets. [[08:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29543.48s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[08:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29546.48s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[08:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29550.48s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[08:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29554.48s)]
*  We need change. And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[08:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29558.48s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[08:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29563.48s)]
*  Is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[08:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29567.48s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[08:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29572.48s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[08:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29587.48s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Dalgamon. [[08:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29590.48s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change, you know, [[08:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29596.48s)]
*  after this lost Liberal decade. [[08:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29599.48s)]
*  We need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[08:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29602.48s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[08:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29605.48s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[08:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29609.48s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29613.48s)]
*  from a position of strength, again, for a change. [[08:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29616.48s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent [[08:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29619.48s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy. [[08:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29626.48s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[08:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29631.48s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[08:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29634.48s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[08:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29640.48s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[08:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29646.48s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[08:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29648.48s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[08:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29652.48s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[08:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29659.48s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[08:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29665.48s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[08:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29669.48s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[08:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29672.48s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[08:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29675.48s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[08:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29679.48s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[08:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29682.48s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[08:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29686.48s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[08:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29689.48s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[08:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29694.48s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[08:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29697.48s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report [[08:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29702.48s)]
*  that the government has published about how the future looks. [[08:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29706.48s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[08:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29710.48s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[08:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29714.48s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade, [[08:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29719.48s)]
*  it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[08:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29723.48s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[08:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29728.48s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able [[08:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29732.48s)]
*  to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[08:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29737.48s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[08:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29741.48s)]
*  that property ownership and, by extension, wealth may become even more concentrated [[08:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29747.48s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[08:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29753.48s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[08:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29757.48s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[08:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29762.48s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[08:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29767.48s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that [[08:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29770.48s)]
*  because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[08:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29775.48s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[08:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29778.48s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[08:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29782.48s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[08:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29785.48s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[08:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29790.48s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[08:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29795.48s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[08:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29801.48s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, [[08:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29807.48s)]
*  were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[08:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29812.48s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[08:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29818.48s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[08:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29823.48s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[08:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29830.48s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[08:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29835.48s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[08:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29843.48s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict [[08:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29846.48s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[08:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29850.48s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, [[08:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29854.48s)]
*  how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[08:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29859.48s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[08:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29863.48s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia [[08:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29868.48s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[08:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29872.48s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[08:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29876.48s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[08:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29881.48s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[08:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29887.48s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[08:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29891.48s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[08:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29897.48s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[08:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29901.48s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate [[08:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29905.48s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[08:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29911.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[08:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29918.48s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[08:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29923.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[08:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29928.48s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[08:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29933.48s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[08:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29941.48s)]
*  That's not a penalty for you, the consumer. [[08:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29945.48s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[08:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29948.48s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[08:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29951.48s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[08:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29957.48s)]
*  who, in their opinion, sell too many gas-powered cars. [[08:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29962.48s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[08:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29966.48s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[08:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29973.48s)]
*  That's not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[08:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29979.48s)]
*  It's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, [[08:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29984.48s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[08:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29989.48s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[08:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29994.48s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[08:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=29997.48s)]
*  a country where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[08:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30001.48s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[08:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30005.48s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[08:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30010.48s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada [[08:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30018.48s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[08:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30023.48s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[08:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30027.48s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[08:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30031.48s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[08:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30033.48s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[08:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30042.48s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[08:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30048.48s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[08:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30057.48s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[08:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30059.48s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[08:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30063.48s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[08:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30065.48s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[08:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30071.48s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[08:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30075.48s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[08:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30079.48s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[08:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30083.48s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[08:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30086.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[08:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30092.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[08:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30095.48s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[08:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30097.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[08:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30102.48s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[08:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30107.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[08:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30111.48s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[08:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30117.48s)]
*  And it hits directly on our workers in the automotive sector. [[08:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30122.48s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate [[08:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30128.48s)]
*  could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[08:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30133.48s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[08:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30138.48s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[08:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30143.48s)]
*  And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[08:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30145.48s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[08:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30148.48s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[08:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30151.48s)]
*  That's because their economic policies send our jobs straight to their countries. [[08:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30156.48s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[08:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30163.48s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[08:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30166.48s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[08:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30170.48s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[08:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30177.48s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another road in the great north of Canada where it [[08:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30185.48s)]
*  is minus 25 degrees. [[08:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30196.579999999998s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[08:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30198.579999999998s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[08:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30202.98s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[08:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30205.579999999998s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction [[08:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30210.38s)]
*  of our economy, such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[08:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30215.38s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says, and that's exactly what he plans to do. [[08:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30221.88s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, but [[08:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30227.48s)]
*  that ban is phased in starting next year. [[08:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30234.280000000002s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[08:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30237.68s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[08:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30240.58s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[08:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30242.98s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[08:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30249.88s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise [[08:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30252.88s)]
*  prices dramatically on Canadian consumers, this at a time when our economy is at record [[08:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30258.780000000002s)]
*  weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[08:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30264.38s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or [[08:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30268.48s)]
*  a working car. [[08:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30272.88s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[08:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30274.58s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[08:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30279.18s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[08:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30281.08s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[08:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30285.08s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[08:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30298.38s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[08:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30304.38s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[08:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30310.98s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[08:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30317.48s)]
*  I have nothing against electric cars. [[08:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30318.48s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[08:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30319.98s)]
*  Free choice. [[08:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30322.18s)]
*  Make your own decision. [[08:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30323.18s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[08:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30324.18s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe [[08:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30326.78s)]
*  the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[08:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30332.68s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles [[08:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30348.18s)]
*  more affordable. [[08:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30354.079999999998s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[08:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30355.079999999998s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[08:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30356.38s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax [[08:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30362.280000000002s)]
*  on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[08:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30368.98s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[08:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30375.58s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[08:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30379.84s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[08:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30382.82s)]
*  Those will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[08:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30386.100000000002s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[08:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30391.2s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[08:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30396.24s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government [[08:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30403.300000000003s)]
*  has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[08:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30410.120000000003s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, and we will go even further [[08:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30413.62s)]
*  with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing [[08:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30417.879999999997s)]
*  the GST on those purchases. [[08:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30423.5s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[08:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30425.7s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[08:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30433.02s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on cars with gasoline is over. [[08:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30434.219999999998s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[08:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30438.62s)]
*  Be clear. [[08:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30445.62s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[08:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30446.62s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[08:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30451.62s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[08:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30459.62s)]
*  And in the regions, people need their cars. [[08:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30461.62s)]
*  I will end the war against the liberal autos and the bloc. [[08:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30465.62s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. [[08:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30472.62s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[08:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30475.62s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[08:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30481.62s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[08:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30487.62s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberal autos and the bloc, who simply want a tramway, [[08:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30496.62s)]
*  or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[08:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30503.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories [[08:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30507.62s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[08:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30513.62s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[08:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30516.62s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[08:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30523.62s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[08:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30527.62s)]
*  No more carney tax. [[08:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30532.62s)]
*  No more carney quotas. [[08:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30534.62s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[08:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30536.62s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[08:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30539.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[08:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30540.62s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[08:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30543.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[08:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30551.62s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[08:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30558.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes. [[08:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30562.62s)]
*  And we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[08:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30567.62s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[08:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30573.62s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[08:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30580.62s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[08:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30587.62s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[08:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30590.62s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[08:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30592.62s)]
*  are we going to elect the Liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[08:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30595.62s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[08:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30604.62s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[08:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30613.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[08:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30622.62s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[08:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30626.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[08:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30634.62s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street, under our proud flag. [[08:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30641.62s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. [[08:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30651.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30655.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30657.62s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[08:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30659.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[08:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30661.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[08:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30668.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[08:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30673.62s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[08:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30679.62s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[08:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30686.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[08:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30693.62s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. [[08:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30701.62s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[08:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30706.62s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[08:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30709.62s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. It doesn't matter if you've been here for... [[08:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30719.62s)]
*  if your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[08:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30724.62s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[08:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30728.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[08:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30735.62s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[08:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30741.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[08:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30746.62s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[08:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30751.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[08:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30760.62s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[08:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30765.62s)]
*  Al-Fansi. [[08:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30773.62s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[08:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30779.62s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[08:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30783.62s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again, something that has been lost these last few years. [[08:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30787.62s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[08:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30793.62s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[08:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30797.62s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate that you love. [[08:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30801.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[08:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30806.62s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[08:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30809.62s)]
*  The promise of Canada, that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[08:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30813.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[08:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30822.62s)]
*  And that beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[08:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30830.62s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[08:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30835.62s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[08:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30841.62s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth Liberal mandate. [[08:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30844.62s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[08:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30847.62s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. [[08:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30853.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30858.62s)]
*  Next question. [[08:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30859.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[08:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30860.62s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[08:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30863.62s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[08:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30865.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30872.62s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[08:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30873.62s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[08:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30877.62s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[08:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30879.62s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave, [[08:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30881.62s)]
*  which it's an incredible honour to be back. [[08:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30894.62s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[08:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30898.62s)]
*  They want change. [[08:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30901.62s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[08:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30902.62s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[08:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30908.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control, [[08:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30913.62s)]
*  and we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[08:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30918.62s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[08:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30924.62s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[08:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30927.62s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[08:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30930.62s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[08:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30932.62s)]
*  That is our mission. [[08:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30934.62s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[08:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30936.62s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[08:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30939.62s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[08:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30942.62s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[08:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30949.62s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[08:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30952.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[08:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30957.62s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[08:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30963.62s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[08:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30966.62s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[08:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30970.62s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[08:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30972.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30973.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30974.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30975.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30982.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30983.62s)]
*  It's a... [[08:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30984.62s)]
*  There's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[08:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30986.62s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[08:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30991.62s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[08:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30993.62s)]
*  People need change. [[08:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30996.62s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[08:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=30999.62s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[08:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31005.62s)]
*  in the last five years. [[08:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31011.62s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city [[08:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31013.62s)]
*  across Canada. [[08:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31019.62s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[08:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31021.62s)]
*  After the decades lost of the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[08:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31024.62s)]
*  it needs to change. [[08:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31029.62s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[08:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31031.62s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, [[08:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31033.62s)]
*  cut taxes, free housing and natural resources to give Canadians an affordable [[08:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31039.62s)]
*  and safe life. [[08:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31047.62s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[08:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31052.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31055.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31056.62s)]
*  Next question. [[08:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31057.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. [[08:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31058.62s)]
*  Good morning. [[08:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31061.62s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[08:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31062.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[08:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31063.62s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[08:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31064.62s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[08:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31067.62s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[08:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31070.62s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals [[08:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31073.62s)]
*  and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[08:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31081.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[08:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31090.62s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[08:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31093.62s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[08:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31098.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[08:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31101.62s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[08:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31106.62s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[08:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31110.62s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[08:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31114.62s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, [[08:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31116.62s)]
*  liberal tax, on vehicles? [[08:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31119.62s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[08:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31122.62s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[08:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31127.62s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[08:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31130.62s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[08:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31134.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[08:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31138.62s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[08:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31142.62s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[08:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31148.62s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax [[08:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31150.62s)]
*  on your gas-powered automobile. [[08:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31155.62s)]
*  If you vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle [[08:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31158.62s)]
*  that is made in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs [[08:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31164.62s)]
*  for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[08:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31168.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[08:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31171.62s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[08:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31173.62s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[08:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31176.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31179.62s)]
*  In French. [[08:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31180.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31186.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[08:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31188.62s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[08:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31195.62s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney, during a tariff war, [[08:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31199.62s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas and diesel cars. [[08:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31204.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers, [[08:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31211.62s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[08:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31218.62s)]
*  How can someone replace their car [[08:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31224.62s)]
*  with a tax of $20,000? [[08:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31230.62s)]
*  What will they do to get jobs? [[08:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31235.62s)]
*  It's impossible. [[08:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31239.62s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will put an end to the tax [[08:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31241.62s)]
*  that Liberal Democrats propose, and we'll do it differently. [[08:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31246.62s)]
*  We'll eliminate the sale tax on cars made in Canada [[08:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31251.62s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs back to Canada. [[08:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31255.62s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, you'll pay a tax of $20,000 for gas cars. [[08:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31260.62s)]
*  With Conservatives, you'll pay less, no TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[08:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31266.62s)]
*  That's the choice. [[08:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31277.62s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which will increase prices for cars, [[08:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31278.62s)]
*  or a change with Conservatives that will cut gas taxes, [[08:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31283.62s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[08:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31288.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31291.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31293.62s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[08:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31294.62s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[08:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31297.62s)]
*  Hello. [[08:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31300.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st method [[08:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31301.62s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney, [[08:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31305.62s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty [[08:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31308.62s)]
*  during their discussion. [[08:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31313.62s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[08:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31314.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[08:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31318.62s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[08:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31320.62s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[08:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31322.62s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I'll say that Canada will never be an American state. [[08:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31326.62s)]
*  We have to defend our sovereignty. [[08:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31332.62s)]
*  And that means we have to focus on what we can control. [[08:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31335.62s)]
*  What can we control? [[08:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31341.62s)]
*  We can reverse the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised Justin Trudeau. [[08:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31343.62s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, [[08:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31353.62s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investments to the United States. [[08:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31357.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[08:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31362.62s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[08:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31365.62s)]
*  We have to reverse all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[08:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31369.62s)]
*  Because after a decade lost, the Liberals who have increased the cost [[08:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31376.62s)]
*  and made our economy go down, [[08:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31382.62s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[08:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31387.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government [[08:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31391.62s)]
*  that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[08:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31395.62s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of homes, [[08:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31399.62s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[08:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31404.62s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[08:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31420.62s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[08:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31423.62s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, [[08:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31425.62s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[08:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31427.62s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[08:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31430.62s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[08:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31433.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[08:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31437.62s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[08:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31441.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[08:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31447.62s)]
*  and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars [[08:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31453.62s)]
*  that Liberals pushed south. [[08:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31458.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[08:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31460.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, [[08:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31465.62s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[08:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31473.62s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[08:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31476.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31480.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[08:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31481.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[08:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31488.62s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government [[08:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31490.62s)]
*  that will reduce taxes and taxes, build homes, free our natural resources [[08:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31494.62s)]
*  and rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[08:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31500.62s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[08:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31507.62s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[08:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31511.62s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[08:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31514.62s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets [[08:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31519.62s)]
*  after the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[08:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31522.62s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb. [[08:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31527.62s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[08:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31531.62s)]
*  We need change. [[08:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31535.62s)]
*  And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[08:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31537.62s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[08:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31539.62s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[08:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31544.62s)]
*  Rick Perkins. [[08:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31548.62s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[08:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31555.62s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. [[08:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31564.62s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris D'Avdaman. [[08:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31567.62s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[08:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31573.62s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[08:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31576.62s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[08:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31582.62s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[08:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31586.62s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[08:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31590.62s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[08:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31595.62s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent [[08:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31597.62s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy, we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[08:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31603.62s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[08:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31611.62s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[08:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31616.62s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[08:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31624.62s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[08:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31629.62s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[08:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31635.62s)]
*  liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[08:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31641.62s)]
*  More expensive food, homes and cars. [[08:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31648.62s)]
*  Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[08:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31651.62s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[08:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31655.62s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[08:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31660.62s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic advisor. [[08:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31665.62s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[08:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31673.62s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published [[08:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31678.62s)]
*  about how the future looks. They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[08:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31684.62s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[08:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31690.62s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade, [[08:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31695.62s)]
*  it's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[08:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31700.62s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the liberals have created for us. [[08:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31704.62s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[08:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31708.62s)]
*  and not through hard work. [[08:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31715.62s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[08:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31717.62s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[08:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31723.62s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[08:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31729.62s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[08:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31734.62s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[08:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31739.62s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[08:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31744.62s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable [[08:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31747.62s)]
*  and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[08:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31754.62s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[08:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31759.62s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scourge for food on public lands. [[08:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31762.62s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[08:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31772.62s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[08:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31778.62s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[08:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31784.62s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[08:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31791.62s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[08:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31795.62s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[08:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31800.62s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[08:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31807.62s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 [[08:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31812.62s)]
*  will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[08:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31818.62s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict [[08:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31822.62s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[08:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31827.62s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[08:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31831.62s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[08:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31840.62s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[08:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31845.62s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, many people in the crowd said, [[08:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31849.62s)]
*  what you were describing is Canada today. [[08:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31854.62s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[08:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31858.62s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[08:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31863.62s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[08:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31868.62s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, [[08:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31873.62s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[08:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31877.62s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[08:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31881.62s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[08:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31887.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, [[08:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31894.62s)]
*  in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[08:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31900.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[08:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31904.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[08:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31909.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[08:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31917.62s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[08:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31921.62s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[08:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31924.62s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[08:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31927.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[08:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31933.62s)]
*  who, in their opinion, sell too many gas-powered cars. [[08:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31938.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[08:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31942.62s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[08:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31949.62s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[08:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31956.62s)]
*  It's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, [[08:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31960.62s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[08:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31965.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[08:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31970.62s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[08:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31973.62s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[08:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31977.62s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[08:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31981.62s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[08:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31986.62s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada [[08:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31994.62s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[08:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=31999.62s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[08:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32003.62s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[08:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32007.62s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[08:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32009.62s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[08:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32018.62s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[08:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32024.62s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[08:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32033.62s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[08:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32035.62s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[08:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32039.62s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[08:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32041.62s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[08:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32047.62s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[08:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32051.62s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[08:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32056.62s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[08:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32060.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[08:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32063.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[08:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32069.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[08:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32071.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[08:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32074.62s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[08:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32079.62s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[08:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32084.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[08:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32088.62s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[08:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32094.62s)]
*  And it strikes directly at our workers in the automotive sector. [[08:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32099.62s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick [[08:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32104.62s)]
*  believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[08:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32107.62s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[08:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32114.62s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[08:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32119.62s)]
*  And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[08:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32121.62s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[08:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32124.62s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[08:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32127.62s)]
*  And the reason why they're doing that is because they're not going to be able to afford [[08:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32132.62s)]
*  to pay their bills. [[08:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32136.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32138.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32141.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32144.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32147.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32150.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32153.62s)]
*  And they're not going to be able to afford to pay their bills. [[08:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32156.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[08:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32159.62s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[08:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32165.62s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[08:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32168.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[08:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32173.62s)]
*  use the regular gas-powered vehicles to get rid of the gas-powered vehicles. [[08:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32175.62s)]
*  And he's right. [[08:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32180.62s)]
*  He's right. [[08:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32181.62s)]
*  And he's right. [[08:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32182.62s)]
*  And he's right. [[08:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32183.62s)]
*  And he's right. [[08:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32184.62s)]
*  And he's right. [[08:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32185.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[08:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32187.62s)]
*  use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[08:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32189.62s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[08:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32192.62s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[08:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32198.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[08:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32200.62s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[08:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32203.62s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. [[08:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32210.62s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[08:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32214.62s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[08:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32217.62s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[08:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32219.62s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[08:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32226.62s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[08:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32229.62s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers, [[08:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32233.62s)]
*  at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[08:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32238.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[08:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32244.62s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[08:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32250.62s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[08:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32255.62s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[08:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32257.62s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[08:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32261.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[08:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32268.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[08:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32270.62s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[08:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32276.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[08:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32283.62s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[08:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32286.62s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[08:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32288.62s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[08:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32290.62s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[08:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32292.62s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[08:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32298.62s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada [[08:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32306.62s)]
*  while making automobiles more affordable. [[08:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32310.62s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[08:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32313.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on an auto sector. [[08:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32314.62s)]
*  You vote for a change. [[08:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32319.62s)]
*  You vote for an added tax. [[08:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32320.62s)]
*  You vote for a real change. [[08:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32322.62s)]
*  And if you vote for a change, you get a tax cut on any auto sector you own. [[08:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32324.62s)]
*  That's how we do it. [[08:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32328.62s)]
*  But don't tell me you've got to do it. [[08:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32330.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[08:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32332.62s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power, [[08:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32338.62s)]
*  and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[08:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32341.62s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[08:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32347.62s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[08:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32351.62s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[08:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32355.62s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[08:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32358.62s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[08:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32361.62s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made, [[08:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32367.62s)]
*  but we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[08:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32372.62s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, [[08:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32379.62s)]
*  and the other commitments the government has made, [[08:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32383.62s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[08:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32387.62s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, [[08:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32389.62s)]
*  and we will go even further with powerful incentives [[08:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32392.62s)]
*  for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[08:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32395.62s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[08:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32398.62s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[09:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32401.62s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[09:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32408.62s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on cars with gasoline is over. [[09:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32410.62s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and depend on are over. [[09:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32414.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[09:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32421.62s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[09:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32423.62s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, [[09:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32427.62s)]
*  but we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[09:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32431.62s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[09:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32435.62s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[09:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32438.62s)]
*  I will end the war against automobiles, liberals and the bloc. [[09:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32442.62s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[09:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32448.62s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[09:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32451.62s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[09:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32457.62s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars [[09:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32463.62s)]
*  and highways. [[09:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32470.62s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the liberals and the bloc, [[09:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32472.62s)]
*  who simply want a highway, [[09:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32476.62s)]
*  or the Conservatives who prefer a third link. [[09:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32479.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements [[09:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32483.62s)]
*  regarding the construction of electric vehicles, [[09:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32485.62s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[09:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32489.62s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[09:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32492.62s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[09:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32495.62s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[09:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32499.62s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[09:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32503.62s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, [[09:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32508.62s)]
*  no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[09:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32511.62s)]
*  We won't stop there. [[09:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32515.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[09:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32516.62s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[09:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32519.62s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[09:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32524.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes [[09:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32527.62s)]
*  and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[09:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32530.62s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[09:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32534.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[09:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32538.62s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government [[09:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32543.62s)]
*  to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[09:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32546.62s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[09:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32549.62s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers [[09:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32555.62s)]
*  and homes for deserving families. [[09:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32559.62s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[09:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32562.62s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[09:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32565.62s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[09:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32567.62s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[09:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32571.62s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[09:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32574.62s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[09:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32580.62s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[09:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32584.62s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[09:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32589.62s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources [[09:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32592.62s)]
*  so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[09:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32595.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years, [[09:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32598.62s)]
*  struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, [[09:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32602.62s)]
*  housing bills and now automobile bills. [[09:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32608.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly [[09:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32611.62s)]
*  on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[09:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32614.62s)]
*  restoring Canada's promise, [[09:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32617.62s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, [[09:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32619.62s)]
*  on a safe street under our proud flag. [[09:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32624.62s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[09:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32627.62s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[09:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32630.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32632.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32634.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32636.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[09:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32640.62s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[09:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32643.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[09:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32646.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, [[09:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32649.62s)]
*  for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[09:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32652.62s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[09:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32655.62s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, [[09:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32658.62s)]
*  not just the supporters that they have. [[09:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32661.62s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[09:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32663.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[09:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32669.62s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[09:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32672.62s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[09:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32678.62s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[09:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32681.62s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[09:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32683.62s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[09:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32686.62s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[09:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32691.62s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[09:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32696.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, if your family's been here for six generations, [[09:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32699.62s)]
*  or if you've been here for six weeks. [[09:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32703.62s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[09:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32705.62s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[09:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32708.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[09:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32713.62s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[09:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32718.62s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[09:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32721.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[09:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32723.62s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[09:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32728.62s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[09:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32730.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[09:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32736.62s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. [[09:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32741.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32747.62s)]
*  Al-Fansi. [[09:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32749.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32751.62s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[09:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32755.62s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[09:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32759.62s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again, something that has been lost these last few years. [[09:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32763.62s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[09:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32769.62s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[09:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32773.62s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[09:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32777.62s)]
*  Vote for the candidate that you love. [[09:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32781.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[09:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32783.62s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise, the promise of Canada, [[09:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32785.62s)]
*  that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful home on a safe street. [[09:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32790.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[09:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32798.62s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians around Canada. [[09:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32806.62s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. [[09:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32811.62s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[09:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32817.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[09:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32820.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[09:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32823.62s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[09:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32829.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32835.62s)]
*  Next question. [[09:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32836.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[09:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32837.62s)]
*  During the final days of the campaign, what made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, [[09:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32840.62s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[09:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32844.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32849.62s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[09:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32850.62s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[09:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32854.62s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[09:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32856.62s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[09:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32864.62s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[09:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32872.62s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[09:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32876.62s)]
*  They want change. [[09:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32878.62s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[09:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32879.62s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[09:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32885.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[09:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32891.62s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[09:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32896.62s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[09:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32902.62s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[09:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32905.62s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[09:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32907.62s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[09:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32909.62s)]
*  That is our mission. [[09:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32911.62s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[09:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32913.62s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[09:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32916.62s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[09:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32919.62s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[09:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32926.62s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[09:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32929.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[09:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32934.62s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[09:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32940.62s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[09:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32943.62s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[09:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32947.62s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[09:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32948.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32950.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32951.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32958.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32959.62s)]
*  It's a... [[09:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32960.62s)]
*  There's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[09:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32962.62s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[09:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32967.62s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[09:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32969.62s)]
*  People need change. [[09:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32973.62s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[09:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32976.62s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada [[09:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32981.62s)]
*  than in the United States in the last five years. [[09:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32987.62s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax [[09:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32990.62s)]
*  more than in any other city across Canada. [[09:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32993.62s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[09:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=32998.62s)]
*  After the lost decade of Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[09:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33001.62s)]
*  it needs to change. [[09:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33006.62s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[09:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33008.62s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government [[09:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33010.62s)]
*  that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[09:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33014.62s)]
*  free housing and natural resources [[09:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33018.62s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[09:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33024.62s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[09:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33028.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33031.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33032.62s)]
*  Next question. [[09:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33033.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[09:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33036.62s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[09:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33038.62s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[09:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33040.62s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[09:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33044.62s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[09:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33047.62s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[09:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33050.62s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[09:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33055.62s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[09:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33059.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[09:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33067.62s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[09:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33070.62s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[09:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33075.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[09:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33077.62s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[09:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33083.62s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax. [[09:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33087.62s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[09:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33089.62s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[09:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33091.62s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[09:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33093.62s)]
*  when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[09:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33095.62s)]
*  I will ask that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[09:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33099.62s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[09:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33104.62s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[09:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33107.62s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[09:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33111.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[09:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33115.62s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[09:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33119.62s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[09:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33123.62s)]
*  You vote for a fourth liberal term, [[09:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33126.62s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[09:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33129.62s)]
*  You vote conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[09:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33135.62s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians [[09:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33142.62s)]
*  and strengthening our economy. [[09:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33146.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[09:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33148.62s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[09:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33149.62s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[09:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33151.62s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[09:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33153.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33156.62s)]
*  In French. [[09:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33157.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33162.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[09:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33165.62s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[09:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33171.62s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney. [[09:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33175.62s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney. [[09:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33178.62s)]
*  During a tariff war, [[09:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33179.62s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000 [[09:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33181.62s)]
*  for gas-powered cars and diesel engines. [[09:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33185.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for workers in the automobile industry, [[09:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33188.62s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[09:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33195.62s)]
*  How can this be when someone has to replace their car [[09:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33201.62s)]
*  but they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[09:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33207.62s)]
*  What will they do to get jobs? [[09:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33213.62s)]
*  It's impossible. [[09:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33217.62s)]
*  On the contrary, [[09:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33219.62s)]
*  the Conservatives will put an end to the tax on automobiles proposed by the Liberals. [[09:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33221.62s)]
*  And we'll do it differently. [[09:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33227.62s)]
*  We'll eliminate the tax on automobiles made in Canada [[09:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33230.62s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs here to Canada. [[09:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33234.62s)]
*  So the choice, with the Liberals, [[09:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33239.62s)]
*  you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars. [[09:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33241.62s)]
*  With the Conservatives, [[09:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33245.62s)]
*  you will pay less than a TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[09:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33247.62s)]
*  That's the choice. [[09:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33256.62s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, [[09:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33257.62s)]
*  which will increase prices for everything, [[09:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33260.62s)]
*  or change the way Conservatives cut gas taxes, [[09:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33262.62s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[09:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33266.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33269.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33271.62s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[09:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33272.62s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[09:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33275.62s)]
*  Hello. [[09:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33278.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st Method [[09:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33279.62s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney, [[09:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33283.62s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had told us that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty [[09:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33285.62s)]
*  and that Canada, during their discussion, [[09:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33290.62s)]
*  how do you interpret that? [[09:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33292.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[09:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33294.62s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[09:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33297.62s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[09:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33299.62s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, [[09:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33303.62s)]
*  but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[09:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33305.62s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[09:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33309.62s)]
*  And that means we must concentrate on what we can control. [[09:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33312.62s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies [[09:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33319.62s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[09:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33324.62s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debt and inflation, [[09:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33329.62s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investments in the United States. [[09:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33334.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[09:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33338.62s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[09:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33341.62s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[09:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33346.62s)]
*  Because after a decade of the Liberals who have increased the cost [[09:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33353.62s)]
*  and made our economy fall, [[09:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33359.62s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[09:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33363.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government [[09:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33367.62s)]
*  that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[09:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33371.62s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[09:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33375.62s)]
*  and bring our jobs back here to keep Americans in check with force. [[09:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33380.62s)]
*  We will focus on what we can control, [[09:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33401.62s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[09:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33404.62s)]
*  that Mr. Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[09:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33407.62s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[09:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33410.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[09:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33414.62s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[09:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33418.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[09:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33424.62s)]
*  and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars [[09:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33430.62s)]
*  that Liberals pushed south. [[09:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33434.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[09:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33437.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy [[09:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33441.62s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[09:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33449.62s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[09:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33453.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33457.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[09:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33458.62s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[09:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33484.62s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[09:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33488.62s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[09:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33491.62s)]
*  Change so that you're once again safe on your streets. [[09:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33496.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[09:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33499.62s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[09:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33504.62s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[09:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33508.62s)]
*  We need change. And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[09:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33512.62s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[09:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33516.62s)]
*  We have – is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[09:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33521.62s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[09:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33525.62s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[09:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33537.62s)]
*  We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris Delcamain. [[09:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33543.62s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[09:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33548.62s)]
*  You know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change, [[09:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33552.62s)]
*  and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[09:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33557.62s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[09:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33559.62s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks [[09:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33562.62s)]
*  to unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[09:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33566.62s)]
*  from a position of strength, again, for a change. [[09:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33569.62s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[09:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33573.62s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy, [[09:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33579.62s)]
*  we're going to cut handouts to insiders, [[09:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33584.62s)]
*  and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[09:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33588.62s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[09:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33593.62s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[09:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33599.62s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[09:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33601.62s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[09:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33606.62s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[09:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33613.62s)]
*  liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[09:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33618.62s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything, more expensive food, homes and cars. [[09:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33622.62s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[09:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33628.62s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the liberals will have to print even more money, [[09:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33632.62s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[09:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33635.62s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life, [[09:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33639.62s)]
*  just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[09:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33642.62s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[09:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33648.62s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[09:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33650.62s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, [[09:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33655.62s)]
*  but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[09:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33657.62s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[09:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33663.62s)]
*  One section says, [[09:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33667.62s)]
*  2040, more snakes than ladders. [[09:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33669.62s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade. [[09:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33672.62s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[09:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33676.62s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the liberals have created for us. [[09:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33681.62s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead [[09:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33685.62s)]
*  through inheritance and not through hard work. [[09:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33691.62s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[09:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33694.62s)]
*  that property ownership and, by extension, wealth may become even more concentrated [[09:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33700.62s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[09:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33706.62s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[09:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33710.62s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[09:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33715.62s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[09:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33720.62s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, [[09:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33723.62s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[09:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33727.62s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[09:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33732.62s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[09:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33736.62s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[09:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33738.62s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[09:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33743.62s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[09:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33749.62s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[09:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33755.62s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, [[09:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33761.62s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[09:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33767.62s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[09:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33772.62s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[09:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33777.62s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[09:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33783.62s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[09:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33788.62s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[09:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33796.62s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict, [[09:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33799.62s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[09:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33804.62s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, [[09:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33807.62s)]
*  how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[09:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33812.62s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[09:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33817.62s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[09:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33822.62s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[09:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33826.62s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you are describing is Canada today, [[09:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33829.62s)]
*  the desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[09:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33835.62s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[09:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33840.62s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[09:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33844.62s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home, [[09:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33850.62s)]
*  and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[09:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33853.62s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[09:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33858.62s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[09:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33865.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[09:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33871.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[09:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33876.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[09:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33881.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[09:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33886.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[09:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33894.62s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[09:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33898.62s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[09:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33901.62s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[09:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33904.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[09:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33910.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[09:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33915.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[09:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33919.62s)]
*  it will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[09:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33926.62s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer. [[09:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33933.62s)]
*  It's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, [[09:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33937.62s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[09:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33942.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[09:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33947.62s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[09:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33950.62s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[09:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33954.62s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[09:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33958.62s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[09:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33963.62s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada [[09:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33971.62s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[09:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33976.62s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[09:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33980.62s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[09:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33984.62s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban [[09:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33986.62s)]
*  on gas-powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles [[09:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33993.62s)]
*  that are allowed to be sold will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs [[09:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=33999.62s)]
*  and cost our economy $138 billion. [[09:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34005.62s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[09:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34009.62s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[09:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34012.62s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[09:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34016.62s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[09:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34018.62s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker. [[09:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34024.62s)]
*  Sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[09:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34028.62s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[09:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34032.62s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[09:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34036.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[09:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34039.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[09:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34045.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[09:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34048.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[09:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34050.62s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[09:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34055.62s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[09:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34060.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[09:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34064.62s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. [[09:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34070.62s)]
*  This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[09:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34072.62s)]
*  And it strikes directly. [[09:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34075.62s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, [[09:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34078.62s)]
*  believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[09:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34083.62s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[09:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34090.62s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[09:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34095.62s)]
*  And who's going to benefit? [[09:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34097.62s)]
*  Tesla, foreign car manufacturers, American workers. [[09:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34099.62s)]
*  Even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals stay in power. [[09:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34104.62s)]
*  The reason why they stay in power is because their economic policies [[09:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34108.62s)]
*  send our jobs straight to their country. [[09:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34112.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[09:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34117.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[09:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34120.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[09:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34123.62s)]
*  And this figure shows studies that have been done between minus 7 and minus 15 degrees. [[09:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34130.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another highway in the great north of Canada [[09:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34140.62s)]
*  where it's minus 25 degrees. [[09:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34149.62s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[09:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34152.62s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[09:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34156.62s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[09:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34159.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[09:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34163.62s)]
*  use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[09:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34165.62s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[09:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34169.62s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[09:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34174.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[09:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34177.62s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, [[09:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34180.62s)]
*  but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[09:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34186.62s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[09:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34190.62s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[09:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34193.62s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[09:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34195.62s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[09:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34202.62s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[09:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34205.62s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[09:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34209.62s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[09:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34214.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[09:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34220.62s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[09:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34226.62s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[09:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34231.62s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[09:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34233.62s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[09:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34237.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[09:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34244.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[09:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34247.62s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[09:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34253.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[09:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34260.62s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[09:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34263.62s)]
*  If you want a car, buy one. [[09:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34265.62s)]
*  If you want a car, buy one. [[09:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34267.62s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[09:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34270.62s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[09:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34272.62s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[09:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34278.62s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada [[09:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34286.62s)]
*  while making automobiles more affordable. [[09:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34291.62s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[09:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34293.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[09:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34295.62s)]
*  You vote for the Canadian car. [[09:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34301.62s)]
*  You vote for the Canadian car. [[09:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34303.62s)]
*  You vote for the Canadian car. [[09:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34305.62s)]
*  You vote for the Canadian car. [[09:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34307.62s)]
*  You vote for the Canadian car. [[09:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34309.62s)]
*  You get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[09:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34311.62s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power. [[09:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34314.62s)]
*  And you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[09:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34318.62s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[09:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34328.62s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[09:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34332.62s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[09:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34335.62s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[09:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34338.62s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[09:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34343.62s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[09:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34348.62s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[09:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34356.62s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[09:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34363.62s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[09:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34366.62s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[09:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34369.62s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[09:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34375.62s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from its first day in power. [[09:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34378.62s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[09:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34385.62s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on cars is over. [[09:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34387.62s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and depend on are over. [[09:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34391.62s)]
*  Be clear. If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[09:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34398.62s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect. [[09:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34404.62s)]
*  But we will not force this choice on Canadians. [[09:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34408.62s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[09:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34412.62s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[09:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34414.62s)]
*  I will end the war against automobiles, liberals and the bloc. [[09:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34419.62s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[09:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34425.62s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only live with electric cars. [[09:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34428.62s)]
*  They need a car with gasoline and diesel. [[09:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34434.62s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[09:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34440.62s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between liberals and the bloc, [[09:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34449.62s)]
*  who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[09:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34453.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements related to the construction of electric vehicle factories, [[09:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34460.62s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[09:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34466.62s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[09:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34469.62s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[09:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34472.62s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[09:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34480.62s)]
*  No more carney tax. No more carney quotas. [[09:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34485.62s)]
*  No more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[09:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34488.62s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[09:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34492.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[09:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34493.62s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[09:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34496.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[09:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34504.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[09:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34515.62s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[09:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34520.62s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[09:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34526.62s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[09:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34532.62s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[09:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34539.62s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[09:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34545.62s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[09:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34548.62s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[09:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34557.62s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[09:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34567.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[09:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34575.62s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[09:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34579.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[09:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34588.62s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice affordable home, [[09:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34592.62s)]
*  on a safe street under our proud flag. That's what it means to bring change. [[09:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34601.62s)]
*  Now let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[09:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34606.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34610.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[09:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34617.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[09:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34623.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[09:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34626.62s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, [[09:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34632.62s)]
*  not just the supporters that they have. So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[09:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34637.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[09:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34646.62s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. [[09:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34655.62s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[09:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34659.62s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise. [[09:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34662.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[09:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34667.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, if your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[09:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34675.62s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[09:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34681.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[09:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34688.62s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[09:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34694.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[09:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34698.62s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[09:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34704.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[09:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34713.62s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[09:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34718.62s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[09:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34725.62s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. Change so that people have hope again. [[09:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34736.62s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[09:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34742.62s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[09:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34749.62s)]
*  Vote for the candidate that you love. [[09:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34757.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. We need to unite our country around our promise. [[09:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34759.62s)]
*  The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[09:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34766.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[09:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34775.62s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[09:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34783.62s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. They are more divided than ever. [[09:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34788.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. It needs to change with a new Conservative government [[09:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34797.62s)]
*  that will unite Canadians around this promise and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. [[09:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34803.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34812.62s)]
*  Next question. [[09:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34813.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[09:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34814.62s)]
*  In the final days of the campaign, what made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now, [[09:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34817.62s)]
*  and what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[09:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34821.62s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. [[09:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34826.62s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[09:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34832.62s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign [[09:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34835.62s)]
*  in Nova Scotia and never leave, which it's an incredible honour to be back. [[09:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34846.62s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. They want change. [[09:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34852.62s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[09:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34856.62s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[09:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34862.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control, [[09:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34867.62s)]
*  and we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[09:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34872.62s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[09:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34878.62s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[09:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34881.62s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. That is our mission. [[09:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34886.62s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change, a plan that, in fact, is called change. [[09:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34889.62s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[09:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34896.62s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[09:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34903.62s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[09:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34906.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[09:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34911.62s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[09:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34917.62s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[09:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34920.62s)]
*  We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[09:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34924.62s)]
*  In French. [[09:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34928.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34935.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34936.62s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[09:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34938.62s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province, and I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[09:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34944.62s)]
*  People need change. [[09:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34950.62s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[09:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34953.62s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[09:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34958.62s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[09:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34967.62s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[09:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34975.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, costs and crime are increasing. [[09:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34978.62s)]
*  It needs to change. [[09:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34983.62s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[09:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34985.62s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut waste, cut taxes and taxes, [[09:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34987.62s)]
*  free the construction of housing and natural resources [[09:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=34995.62s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[09:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35001.62s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. Thank you very much. [[09:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35005.62s)]
*  The next thing that Mr. Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles. [[09:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35035.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[09:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35044.62s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[09:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35047.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[09:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35054.62s)]
*  When people's old vehicles are breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax. [[09:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35060.62s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? [[09:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35065.62s)]
*  How are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[09:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35069.62s)]
*  I will axe that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[09:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35075.62s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[09:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35080.62s)]
*  We need to protect our ability to make that decision. [[09:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35083.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[09:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35091.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[09:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35095.62s)]
*  Here you have a choice. [[09:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35099.62s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[09:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35103.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[09:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35112.62s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[09:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35119.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[09:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35125.62s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[09:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35130.62s)]
*  In French? [[09:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35135.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35139.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it is irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[09:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35141.62s)]
*  It is irresponsible for Mr. Carney, during a tariff war, to propose a tax of $20,000 [[09:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35152.62s)]
*  for gasoline and diesel cars. [[09:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35161.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers, but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer afford to pay. [[09:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35165.62s)]
*  How can this be when someone has to replace their car, but they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[09:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35178.62s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It is impossible. [[09:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35190.62s)]
*  On the contrary, the Conservatives will put an end to the tax on car workers proposed by the Liberals. [[09:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35196.62s)]
*  And we will do otherwise. [[09:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35204.62s)]
*  We will eliminate the tax on cars made in Canada to promote domestic production and bring jobs here to Canada. [[09:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35207.62s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you will pay a tax of $20,000 for gasoline cars. [[09:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35216.62s)]
*  With the Conservatives, you will pay less, no TPS on the new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[09:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35222.62s)]
*  That is the choice. [[09:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35233.62s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which will increase prices for everything, [[09:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35234.62s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives, which will cut the waste, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[09:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35239.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35246.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35248.62s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[09:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35249.62s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[09:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35252.62s)]
*  Hello. [[09:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35255.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st State in his call with Mark Carney, [[09:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35256.62s)]
*  while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussions. [[09:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35262.62s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[09:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35268.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[09:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35272.62s)]
*  I was not there. [[09:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35274.62s)]
*  It is clear that Mr. Carney must explain this. [[09:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35276.62s)]
*  I was not on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[09:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35280.62s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[09:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35286.62s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[09:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35289.62s)]
*  What can we control? [[09:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35294.62s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[09:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35297.62s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[09:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35307.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[09:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35316.62s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[09:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35323.62s)]
*  Because after a decade lost of liberals who have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[09:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35330.62s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[09:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35340.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut the waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[09:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35344.62s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[09:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35352.62s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in check with force. [[09:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35357.62s)]
*  In English as well? [[09:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35364.62s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[09:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35366.62s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[09:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35368.62s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. [[09:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35370.62s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[09:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35372.62s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[09:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35373.62s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[09:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35376.62s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, [[09:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35378.62s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[09:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35380.62s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[09:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35386.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[09:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35390.62s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[09:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35394.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources [[09:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35400.62s)]
*  to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[09:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35408.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[09:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35413.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, [[09:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35418.62s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[09:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35426.62s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[09:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35430.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35433.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[09:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35435.62s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[09:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35456.62s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[09:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35465.62s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[09:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35468.62s)]
*  Change so that you're once again safe on your streets. [[09:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35473.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[09:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35476.62s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[09:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35484.62s)]
*  We need change. And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[09:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35488.62s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[09:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35493.62s)]
*  We have – is Rick Perkins here? Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[09:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35497.62s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[09:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35502.62s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris Dalgamon. [[09:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35513.62s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change, you know, after this lost liberal decade. [[09:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35524.62s)]
*  We need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. Change to lower the cost of living. [[09:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35531.62s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[09:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35536.62s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[09:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35542.62s)]
*  Again, for a change. Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent [[09:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35547.62s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy. [[09:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35556.62s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[09:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35561.62s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[09:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35569.62s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[09:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35577.62s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[09:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35582.62s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[09:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35589.62s)]
*  liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[09:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35594.62s)]
*  More expensive food, homes and cars. Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[09:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35602.62s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[09:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35609.62s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[09:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35614.62s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[09:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35619.62s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[09:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35627.62s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published [[09:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35632.62s)]
*  about how the future looks. They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[09:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35637.62s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[09:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35643.62s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost liberal decade. [[09:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35648.62s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory [[09:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35653.62s)]
*  that the Liberals have created for us. [[09:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35659.62s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[09:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35662.62s)]
*  and not through hard work. It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[09:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35669.62s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[09:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35677.62s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[09:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35683.62s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[09:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35687.62s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[09:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35692.62s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[09:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35697.62s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable [[09:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35700.62s)]
*  and out of reach, people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[09:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35707.62s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[09:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35712.62s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food [[09:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35715.62s)]
*  on public lands. This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[09:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35724.62s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[09:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35731.62s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue [[09:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35738.62s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[09:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35744.62s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[09:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35748.62s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[09:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35753.62s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[09:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35760.62s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic [[09:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35765.62s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver [[09:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35773.62s)]
*  of social, economic and political conflict, and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[09:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35778.62s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible kind of TV series, how ugly they describe the future [[09:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35784.62s)]
*  in this Government of Canada report. [[09:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35791.62s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[09:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35793.62s)]
*  Now, yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[09:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35798.62s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[09:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35805.62s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[09:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35811.62s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[09:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35817.62s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[09:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35821.62s)]
*  Already, many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, [[09:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35827.62s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[09:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35831.62s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[09:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35835.62s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[09:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35842.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[09:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35848.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[09:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35853.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[09:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35858.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[09:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35863.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[09:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35871.62s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[09:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35874.62s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[09:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35877.62s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[09:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35880.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[09:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35886.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[09:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35891.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's speech. [[09:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35895.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the government-imposed quota, [[09:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35898.62s)]
*  it will have to pay a $20,000 per vehicle tax. [[09:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35902.62s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, [[09:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35909.62s)]
*  it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, [[09:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35913.62s)]
*  if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[09:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35918.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[09:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35923.62s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[09:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35926.62s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[09:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35930.62s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[09:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35935.62s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[09:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35939.62s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada [[09:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35948.62s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[09:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35953.62s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[09:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35957.62s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the auto workers. [[09:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35961.62s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this Liberal ban [[09:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35963.62s)]
*  on gas-powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies [[09:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35970.62s)]
*  on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[09:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35974.62s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs [[09:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35978.62s)]
*  and cost our economy $138 billion. [[09:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35982.62s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[09:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35986.62s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[09:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35989.62s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[09:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35993.62s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle [[09:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=35995.62s)]
*  to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[10:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36001.62s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[10:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36005.62s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[10:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36009.62s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[10:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36013.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[10:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36016.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[10:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36022.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[10:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36024.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[10:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36028.62s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[10:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36032.62s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[10:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36037.62s)]
*  The try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[10:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36041.62s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. [[10:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36047.62s)]
*  This policy is an attack on your paycheck, [[10:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36049.62s)]
*  and it strikes directly at our workers in the automotive sector. [[10:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36052.62s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate [[10:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36057.62s)]
*  could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[10:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36062.62s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[10:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36067.62s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[10:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36072.62s)]
*  And who will benefit? Tesla. [[10:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36074.62s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers, [[10:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36077.62s)]
*  and even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada. [[10:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36081.62s)]
*  Of course, it's because their economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[10:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36086.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[10:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36093.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[10:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36096.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[10:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36099.62s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[10:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36107.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January, [[10:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36117.62s)]
*  or another road in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[10:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36122.62s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[10:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36129.62s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[10:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36133.62s)]
*  He wrote a quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[10:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36136.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[10:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36140.62s)]
*  use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[10:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36142.62s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[10:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36146.62s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[10:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36151.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[10:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36154.62s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, [[10:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36157.62s)]
*  but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[10:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36163.62s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[10:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36167.62s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[10:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36170.62s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[10:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36172.62s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[10:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36179.62s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[10:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36182.62s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[10:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36186.62s)]
*  We're going to do this at a time when our economy is at record weakness [[10:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36191.62s)]
*  and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[10:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36195.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[10:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36198.62s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[10:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36204.62s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[10:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36209.62s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[10:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36211.62s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[10:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36215.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[10:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36221.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[10:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36224.62s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[10:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36230.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[10:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36237.62s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[10:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36240.62s)]
*  If you want a car, buy one. [[10:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36242.62s)]
*  If you want a car, buy one. [[10:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36244.62s)]
*  I have nothing against electric cars. [[10:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36247.62s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[10:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36249.62s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[10:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36251.62s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[10:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36253.62s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[10:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36256.62s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[10:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36261.62s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[10:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36277.62s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[10:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36284.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[10:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36286.62s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[10:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36291.62s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[10:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36301.62s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[10:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36304.62s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[10:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36308.62s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[10:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36312.62s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[10:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36314.62s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[10:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36320.62s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[10:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36325.62s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[10:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36332.62s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[10:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36340.62s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[10:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36342.62s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[10:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36346.62s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[10:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36352.62s)]
*  A Conservative government will remove the tax on vehicles from power on the first day. [[10:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36355.62s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[10:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36362.62s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. [[10:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36364.62s)]
*  The permanent prohibitions on cars you like and don't own are over. [[10:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36368.62s)]
*  Be clear. [[10:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36375.62s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[10:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36376.62s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force Canadians to make this choice. [[10:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36381.62s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[10:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36389.62s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[10:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36391.62s)]
*  I will end the war against the auto sector, the Liberals and the Bloc. [[10:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36395.62s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. [[10:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36402.62s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[10:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36405.62s)]
*  They need a diesel-powered car. [[10:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36411.62s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[10:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36417.62s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, [[10:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36426.62s)]
*  or the Conservatives, who are in favor of a third link. [[10:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36433.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles [[10:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36437.62s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[10:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36442.62s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[10:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36446.62s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[10:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36449.62s)]
*  A government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[10:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36457.62s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[10:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36462.62s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[10:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36468.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[10:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36470.62s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[10:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36473.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[10:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36481.62s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[10:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36488.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes [[10:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36492.62s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[10:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36497.62s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[10:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36503.62s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[10:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36510.62s)]
*  Our choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. [[10:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36517.62s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[10:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36522.62s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[10:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36529.62s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[10:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36534.62s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[10:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36544.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[10:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36552.62s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[10:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36556.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relently on bringing down the cost of living, ending liberal inflation, [[10:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36565.62s)]
*  and restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home on a safe street under our proud flag. [[10:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36571.62s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[10:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36581.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36586.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[10:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36594.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon MacLeod from MBS News. [[10:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36599.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[10:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36603.62s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[10:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36609.62s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[10:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36616.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[10:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36623.62s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. [[10:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36626.62s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[10:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36634.62s)]
*  And you know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[10:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36638.62s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[10:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36649.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[10:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36652.62s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[10:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36658.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[10:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36666.62s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[10:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36672.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[10:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36676.62s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[10:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36681.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[10:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36690.62s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[10:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36695.62s)]
*  And I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[10:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36707.62s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[10:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36713.62s)]
*  A change so that people have hope again. Something that has been lost these last few years. [[10:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36717.62s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[10:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36723.62s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[10:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36727.62s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the Canada that you love. [[10:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36731.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[10:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36736.62s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[10:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36739.62s)]
*  The promise of Canada, that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[10:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36743.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[10:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36752.62s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[10:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36760.62s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[10:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36764.62s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[10:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36771.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[10:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36773.62s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[10:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36776.62s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[10:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36783.62s)]
*  Next question. [[10:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36789.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[10:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36790.62s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[10:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36793.62s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? [[10:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36795.62s)]
*  And what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[10:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36797.62s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[10:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36802.62s)]
*  It's great to be here. Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[10:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36807.62s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[10:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36811.62s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[10:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36824.62s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[10:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36828.62s)]
*  They want change. [[10:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36831.62s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[10:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36832.62s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[10:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36838.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[10:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36843.62s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[10:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36848.62s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[10:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36854.62s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[10:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36857.62s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[10:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36860.62s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[10:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36862.62s)]
*  That is our mission. [[10:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36864.62s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[10:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36866.62s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[10:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36869.62s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[10:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36872.62s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[10:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36879.62s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[10:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36882.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[10:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36887.62s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[10:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36893.62s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[10:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36896.62s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[10:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36900.62s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[10:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36902.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36903.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36904.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36905.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36912.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36913.62s)]
*  It's a... [[10:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36914.62s)]
*  There's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[10:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36916.62s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[10:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36921.62s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[10:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36923.62s)]
*  People need change. [[10:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36926.62s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[10:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36929.62s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States [[10:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36935.62s)]
*  in the last five years. [[10:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36941.62s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city [[10:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36944.62s)]
*  across Canada. [[10:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36949.62s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[10:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36951.62s)]
*  After the decade lost to the Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[10:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36954.62s)]
*  it needs to change. [[10:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36959.62s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[10:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36961.62s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut [[10:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36963.62s)]
*  waste, cut taxes, free housing and natural resources [[10:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36968.62s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[10:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36977.62s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[10:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36982.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36985.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36986.62s)]
*  Next question. [[10:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36987.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. [[10:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36988.62s)]
*  Good morning. [[10:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36991.62s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[10:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36992.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[10:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36993.62s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[10:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36994.62s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[10:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=36997.62s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[10:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37000.62s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the [[10:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37003.62s)]
*  Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made [[10:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37010.62s)]
*  gas-powered vehicles? [[10:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37018.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[10:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37020.62s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[10:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37023.62s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[10:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37028.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean that you won't be able to afford one. [[10:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37031.62s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[10:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37036.62s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax, how are they going to get to work? [[10:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37040.62s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[10:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37044.62s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, [[10:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37046.62s)]
*  Liberal tax, on vehicles? [[10:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37049.62s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[10:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37052.62s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[10:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37057.62s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their [[10:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37060.62s)]
*  ability to make that decision. [[10:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37066.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[10:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37068.62s)]
*  So we will ask the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[10:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37072.62s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[10:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37076.62s)]
*  If you vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your [[10:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37080.62s)]
*  gas-powered automobile. [[10:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37086.62s)]
*  If you vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in [[10:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37088.62s)]
*  Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening [[10:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37094.62s)]
*  our economy. [[10:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37100.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[10:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37101.62s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, [[10:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37102.62s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[10:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37106.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37110.62s)]
*  In French? [[10:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37112.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37114.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000. [[10:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37118.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers, but it will also increase the cost of living for [[10:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37128.62s)]
*  Canadians who can't afford to pay. [[10:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37136.62s)]
*  How can someone who has a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37140.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37148.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37154.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37160.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37164.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37168.62s)]
*  a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, a car, [[10:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37172.62s)]
*  We're going to put an end to the tax on motorists that the Liberals are proposing, [[10:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37176.62s)]
*  and we're going to do otherwise. [[10:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37181.62s)]
*  We're going to eliminate the sale tax on the automobiles made in Canada [[10:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37184.62s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs here in Canada. [[10:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37188.62s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberals, you're going to pay a tax of $20,000 for cars with gas, [[10:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37193.62s)]
*  and with the Conservatives, you're going to pay less than a TPS on the new cars [[10:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37199.62s)]
*  and trucks made in Canada. [[10:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37206.62s)]
*  That's the choice. [[10:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37210.62s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals that will increase prices for everything, [[10:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37212.62s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives that will cut gas taxes, [[10:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37216.62s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[10:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37220.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37223.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37225.62s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[10:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37226.62s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[10:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37228.62s)]
*  Hello. [[10:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37231.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president had spoken about the 51st method [[10:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37232.62s)]
*  in his call with Mark Carney, [[10:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37236.62s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had told us that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty [[10:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37238.62s)]
*  during their discussion. [[10:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37243.62s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[10:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37244.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[10:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37248.62s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[10:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37250.62s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[10:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37253.62s)]
*  I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[10:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37256.62s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[10:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37262.62s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[10:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37266.62s)]
*  What can we control? [[10:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37272.62s)]
*  We must overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[10:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37274.62s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, [[10:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37284.62s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[10:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37288.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources [[10:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37293.62s)]
*  and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[10:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37296.62s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[10:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37301.62s)]
*  Because after a decade of loss of the Liberals, [[10:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37307.62s)]
*  which has increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[10:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37311.62s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[10:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37318.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government [[10:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37322.62s)]
*  that will cut gas taxes, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes. [[10:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37326.62s)]
*  We must stop the production of our resources and the construction of houses. [[10:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37330.62s)]
*  And bring our jobs back here to keep Americans in control. [[10:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37334.62s)]
*  In English as well? [[10:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37341.62s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[10:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37343.62s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[10:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37345.62s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. I wasn't there. [[10:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37347.62s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[10:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37350.62s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[10:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37353.62s)]
*  We will focus on what we can control, [[10:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37355.62s)]
*  which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[10:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37357.62s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[10:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37360.62s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[10:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37363.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[10:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37367.62s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[10:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37371.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes [[10:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37377.62s)]
*  and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars [[10:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37384.62s)]
*  that Liberals pushed south. [[10:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37388.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[10:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37390.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy [[10:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37395.62s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks [[10:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37403.62s)]
*  and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[10:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37406.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37410.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[10:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37412.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[10:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37414.62s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government [[10:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37420.62s)]
*  that will reduce taxes and taxes, build housing, [[10:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37424.62s)]
*  and release our natural resources to be able to rebuild our economic strength [[10:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37428.62s)]
*  to make a change. [[10:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37435.62s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this changed election. [[10:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37437.62s)]
*  There is one word that describes the election. [[10:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37441.62s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[10:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37444.62s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets. [[10:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37449.62s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime [[10:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37452.62s)]
*  and a falling economy under America's thumb, [[10:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37457.62s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth Liberal term. [[10:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37461.62s)]
*  We need change. [[10:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37465.62s)]
*  That is what Conservatives will bring. [[10:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37467.62s)]
*  Today we are here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[10:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37469.62s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. Where is Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[10:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37473.62s)]
*  We have Dr. Steven Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[10:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37478.62s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already. [[10:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37489.62s)]
*  We have got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Delcamont. [[10:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37496.62s)]
*  And we are here today with our plan to bring change. [[10:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37501.62s)]
*  You know, after this lost Liberal decade, we need change [[10:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37505.62s)]
*  and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[10:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37509.62s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[10:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37511.62s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[10:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37515.62s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans [[10:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37519.62s)]
*  from a position of strength. [[10:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37522.62s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[10:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37524.62s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the Liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[10:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37526.62s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, [[10:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37532.62s)]
*  we are going to cut handouts to insiders. [[10:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37537.62s)]
*  And we are going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[10:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37541.62s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher [[10:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37546.62s)]
*  than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[10:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37552.62s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[10:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37554.62s)]
*  he is promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[10:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37559.62s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[10:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37566.62s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, [[10:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37572.62s)]
*  which will drive up prices for everything. [[10:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37576.62s)]
*  We will add more expensive food, homes, and cars. [[10:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37579.62s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[10:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37583.62s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, [[10:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37586.62s)]
*  hike taxes even higher, with inflation driving up the costs [[10:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37589.62s)]
*  and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[10:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37593.62s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting [[10:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37597.62s)]
*  as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[10:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37602.62s)]
*  We've seen a rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[10:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37605.62s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, [[10:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37609.62s)]
*  but this incredible report that the government has published [[10:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37611.62s)]
*  about how the future looks. [[10:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37614.62s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[10:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37617.62s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[10:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37621.62s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[10:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37626.62s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become [[10:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37630.62s)]
*  on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[10:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37635.62s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people [[10:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37639.62s)]
*  will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[10:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37643.62s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, [[10:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37647.62s)]
*  that the economy will shrink, that property ownership and, by extension, [[10:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37651.62s)]
*  wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations [[10:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37656.62s)]
*  abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[10:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37661.62s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[10:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37664.62s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[10:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37669.62s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[10:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37674.62s)]
*  And even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that [[10:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37677.62s)]
*  because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[10:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37682.62s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways [[10:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37685.62s)]
*  without reference to regulations. [[10:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37689.62s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules [[10:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37692.62s)]
*  in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[10:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37696.62s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[10:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37702.62s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[10:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37708.62s)]
*  but the trajectory we were on after the lost liberal decade, were it to continue, [[10:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37714.62s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[10:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37720.62s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[10:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37725.62s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth liberal term will paint [[10:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37729.62s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[10:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37736.62s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic, [[10:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37741.62s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[10:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37749.62s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict, [[10:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37752.62s)]
*  and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[10:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37757.62s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future [[10:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37761.62s)]
*  in this Government of Canada report. [[10:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37768.62s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[10:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37770.62s)]
*  Yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, [[10:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37775.62s)]
*  and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[10:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37779.62s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[10:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37782.62s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[10:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37788.62s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[10:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37793.62s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[10:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37798.62s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home, and thanks to Liberals, [[10:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37803.62s)]
*  you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[10:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37807.62s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate, [[10:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37811.62s)]
*  or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[10:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37818.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[10:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37825.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[10:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37830.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[10:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37835.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[10:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37840.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. [[10:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37848.62s)]
*  It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[10:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37851.62s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, [[10:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37854.62s)]
*  then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[10:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37857.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers [[10:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37863.62s)]
*  who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[10:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37868.62s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[10:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37872.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[10:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37879.62s)]
*  It's not a penalty for the car manufacturer, [[10:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37886.62s)]
*  it's a new tax imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[10:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37890.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, [[10:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37900.62s)]
*  a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[10:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37903.62s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[10:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37907.62s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[10:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37911.62s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[10:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37916.62s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, [[10:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37924.62s)]
*  disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[10:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37929.62s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, [[10:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37933.62s)]
*  and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[10:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37937.62s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[10:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37939.62s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[10:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37948.62s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs [[10:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37954.62s)]
*  and cost our economy $138 billion. [[10:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37959.62s)]
*  That's billion with a B. [[10:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37963.62s)]
*  And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[10:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37966.62s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. [[10:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37970.62s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, [[10:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37972.62s)]
*  a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[10:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37980.62s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada [[10:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37986.62s)]
*  and keep the economy weak and costly. [[10:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37990.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[10:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37993.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[10:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=37998.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[10:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38001.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, [[10:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38004.62s)]
*  and that number comes from tests between minus seven and minus 15. [[10:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38009.62s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[10:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38014.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[10:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38017.62s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. [[10:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38023.62s)]
*  And it strikes directly. [[10:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38028.62s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, [[10:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38031.62s)]
*  independent economists like Ross McKittrick, [[10:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38034.62s)]
*  think that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry [[10:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38037.62s)]
*  and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[10:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38044.62s)]
*  We're talking about billions. [[10:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38049.62s)]
*  And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[10:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38051.62s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers, even Donald Trump, [[10:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38054.62s)]
*  say they prefer when Liberals stay in power. [[10:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38059.62s)]
*  And the reason why they're staying in power is because their economic policies [[10:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38062.62s)]
*  send our jobs straight to their country. [[10:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38067.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. [[10:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38071.62s)]
*  According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[10:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38074.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[10:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38077.62s)]
*  This figure comes from studies that have been done between minus 7 and minus 15 degrees. [[10:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38084.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another road in the great north of Canada [[10:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38094.62s)]
*  where it's minus 25 degrees. [[10:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38103.62s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. [[10:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38105.62s)]
*  He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[10:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38110.62s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[10:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38112.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to, quote, [[10:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38116.62s)]
*  use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, [[10:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38118.62s)]
*  such as explicit timetables, to phase out internal combustion engines. [[10:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38122.62s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. [[10:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38127.62s)]
*  And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[10:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38130.62s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035, [[10:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38133.62s)]
*  but that ban is phased in starting next year. [[10:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38139.62s)]
*  In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. [[10:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38143.62s)]
*  This is a now problem. [[10:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38146.62s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, [[10:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38148.62s)]
*  how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[10:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38155.62s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, [[10:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38158.62s)]
*  and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[10:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38162.62s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[10:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38167.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[10:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38174.62s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[10:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38180.62s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. [[10:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38185.62s)]
*  Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[10:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38187.62s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[10:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38191.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. [[10:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38197.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[10:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38200.62s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[10:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38206.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[10:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38213.62s)]
*  If you want one, you can get one. [[10:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38216.62s)]
*  If you want one, you can get one. [[10:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38218.62s)]
*  If you want one, you can get one. [[10:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38220.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. [[10:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38223.62s)]
*  If you want one, buy one. [[10:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38226.62s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. [[10:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38228.62s)]
*  I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[10:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38230.62s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change [[10:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38232.62s)]
*  and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[10:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38238.62s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[10:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38253.62s)]
*  And there's your choice. [[10:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38261.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[10:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38262.62s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, [[10:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38268.62s)]
*  all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[10:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38277.62s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. [[10:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38281.62s)]
*  You will decide what's good for you and your family. [[10:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38285.62s)]
*  You will decide what to do with your money. [[10:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38288.62s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. [[10:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38291.62s)]
*  We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[10:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38297.62s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. [[10:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38302.62s)]
*  We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made [[10:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38309.62s)]
*  because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[10:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38317.62s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada. [[10:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38319.62s)]
*  And we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, [[10:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38322.62s)]
*  like axing the GST on those purchases. [[10:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38328.62s)]
*  A Conservative government will remove the tax on vehicles from power on its first day. [[10:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38332.62s)]
*  The quotas are over. [[10:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38339.62s)]
*  The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. [[10:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38340.62s)]
*  The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[10:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38344.62s)]
*  Be clear. [[10:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38351.62s)]
*  If people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. [[10:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38353.62s)]
*  It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force Canadians to choose it. [[10:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38357.62s)]
*  It is a free choice. [[10:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38365.62s)]
*  But in the regions, people need their cars. [[10:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38367.62s)]
*  I will end the war against the auto sector, the Liberals and the Bloc. [[10:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38371.62s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. [[10:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38378.62s)]
*  People in the regions of Quebec cannot only survive with electric cars. [[10:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38381.62s)]
*  They need a diesel-powered car. [[10:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38387.62s)]
*  We will also support motorways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[10:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38393.62s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, [[10:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38402.62s)]
*  who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives who prefer a third link. [[10:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38406.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles, [[10:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38413.62s)]
*  because we respect the contracts. [[10:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38418.62s)]
*  We will make sure that government policy follows common sense [[10:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38422.62s)]
*  instead of being driven by fantastical liberal ideologies [[10:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38425.62s)]
*  that drive up your cost of living and drive our jobs out. [[10:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38429.62s)]
*  We will protect a government that gives you choice instead of hoarding control for itself. [[10:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38433.62s)]
*  No more carney tax, no more carney quotas, no more liberal bans on cars Canadians want to drive. [[10:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38439.62s)]
*  And we won't stop there. [[10:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38445.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. [[10:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38447.62s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off [[10:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38450.62s)]
*  and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[10:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38455.62s)]
*  We will act the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes [[10:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38458.62s)]
*  to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[10:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38465.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes, [[10:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38469.62s)]
*  and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, [[10:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38474.62s)]
*  all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[10:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38480.62s)]
*  We will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[10:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38487.62s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. [[10:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38493.62s)]
*  It could not be more clear. [[10:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38496.62s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime, [[10:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38498.62s)]
*  are we going to elect liberals for a fourth term [[10:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38502.62s)]
*  with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[10:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38505.62s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government [[10:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38511.62s)]
*  that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, [[10:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38515.62s)]
*  lower taxes for Canadians, [[10:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38520.62s)]
*  and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[10:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38523.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[10:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38529.62s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills, and now automobile bills. [[10:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38533.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, [[10:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38541.62s)]
*  ending liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, [[10:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38546.62s)]
*  where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[10:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38549.62s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. [[10:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38557.62s)]
*  Now, let's bring it home. [[10:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38560.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38562.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38564.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38566.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. [[10:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38571.62s)]
*  Please say your name and outlet. [[10:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38573.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[10:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38577.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years, [[10:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38580.62s)]
*  have been telling us how they are different from each other, [[10:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38584.62s)]
*  but after Monday, whoever forms government, [[10:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38586.62s)]
*  the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[10:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38588.62s)]
*  What is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[10:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38593.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[10:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38600.62s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. [[10:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38603.62s)]
*  They've been told to turn against each other. [[10:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38609.62s)]
*  I think that's the wrong way. [[10:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38612.62s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[10:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38614.62s)]
*  What unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, [[10:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38617.62s)]
*  that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[10:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38622.62s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[10:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38626.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, [[10:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38629.62s)]
*  your family's been here for six generations, or if you've been here for six weeks. [[10:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38631.62s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, [[10:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38635.62s)]
*  you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[10:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38639.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[10:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38643.62s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[10:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38649.62s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. [[10:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38651.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[10:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38653.62s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[10:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38658.62s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[10:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38660.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[10:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38666.62s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise, and let's bring home change for the future. [[10:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38671.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38677.62s)]
*  Al-Fansi. [[10:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38680.62s)]
*  I should say that the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[10:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38686.62s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[10:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38690.62s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[10:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38694.62s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[10:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38696.62s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[10:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38700.62s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian, get out and exercise your democratic right. [[10:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38704.62s)]
*  Vote for a change. [[10:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38708.62s)]
*  Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[10:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38710.62s)]
*  Vote for the Canada that you love. [[10:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38712.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[10:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38714.62s)]
*  We need to unite our country around our promise. [[10:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38716.62s)]
*  The promise of Canada, that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[10:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38720.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard and realize your dreams. [[10:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38729.62s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[10:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38737.62s)]
*  After the decade of the Liberals, people have lost hope. [[10:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38741.62s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[10:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38747.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. [[10:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38750.62s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[10:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38753.62s)]
*  and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make a change. [[10:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38759.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38765.62s)]
*  Next question. [[10:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38766.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. [[10:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38767.62s)]
*  You're in the final days of the campaign. [[10:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38770.62s)]
*  What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? [[10:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38772.62s)]
*  And what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[10:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38774.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38779.62s)]
*  Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[10:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38780.62s)]
*  It's great to be here. [[10:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38784.62s)]
*  Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. [[10:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38786.62s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[10:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38788.62s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[10:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38801.62s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[10:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38805.62s)]
*  They want change. [[10:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38808.62s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[10:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38809.62s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[10:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38815.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[10:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38820.62s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[10:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38825.62s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[10:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38831.62s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[10:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38834.62s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[10:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38837.62s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[10:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38839.62s)]
*  That is our mission. [[10:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38841.62s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[10:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38843.62s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[10:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38846.62s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[10:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38849.62s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[10:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38856.62s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[10:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38859.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future [[10:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38864.62s)]
*  and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[10:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38870.62s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[10:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38873.62s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[10:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38877.62s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[10:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38879.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38880.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38888.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38889.62s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[10:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38890.62s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[10:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38897.62s)]
*  And I'm pleased to be here to talk about change. [[10:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38899.62s)]
*  People need change. [[10:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38903.62s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[10:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38906.62s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded. [[10:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38911.62s)]
*  37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[10:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38915.62s)]
*  The cost of housing has increased in Halifax more than in any other city across Canada. [[10:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38921.62s)]
*  Criminality is now out of control. [[10:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38928.62s)]
*  After the lost decade of Liberals, costs and crime that are increasing, [[10:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38931.62s)]
*  it needs to change. [[10:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38936.62s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth mandate. [[10:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38938.62s)]
*  We need a real change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas taxes, [[10:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38940.62s)]
*  cut tax aid, free housing construction and natural resources [[10:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38946.62s)]
*  to give Canadians an affordable and safe life. [[10:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38954.62s)]
*  That's the message to the people of Nova Scotia. [[10:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38959.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38962.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38963.62s)]
*  Next question. [[10:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38964.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Poliev. [[10:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38965.62s)]
*  Good morning. [[10:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38968.62s)]
*  Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[10:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38969.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[10:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38970.62s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, [[10:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38971.62s)]
*  how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[10:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38974.62s)]
*  First of all, I will ask the Carney tax. [[10:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38977.62s)]
*  Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute [[10:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38980.62s)]
*  how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be [[10:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38985.62s)]
*  to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[10:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38989.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. [[10:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=38997.62s)]
*  Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, [[10:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39000.62s)]
*  he wants to take them even further. [[10:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39005.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. [[10:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39007.62s)]
*  So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, [[10:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39013.62s)]
*  they can't afford the Carney tax. [[10:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39017.62s)]
*  How are they going to get to work? [[10:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39019.62s)]
*  What are they going to do? [[10:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39021.62s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country [[10:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39023.62s)]
*  when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[10:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39025.62s)]
*  I will ask that tax, and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. [[10:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39029.62s)]
*  They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[10:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39034.62s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, [[10:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39037.62s)]
*  and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[10:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39041.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. [[10:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39045.62s)]
*  So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[10:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39049.62s)]
*  So here you have a choice. [[10:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39055.62s)]
*  You vote for a fourth Liberal term, [[10:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39057.62s)]
*  you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[10:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39059.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, [[10:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39065.62s)]
*  knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[10:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39072.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. [[10:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39078.62s)]
*  We need to put our country first for a change, [[10:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39079.62s)]
*  put taxpayers first for a change, [[10:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39081.62s)]
*  put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. [[10:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39083.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39086.62s)]
*  In French. [[10:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39088.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39093.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney [[10:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39096.62s)]
*  to propose a tax of $20,000. [[10:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39102.62s)]
*  It's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas and diesel cars. [[10:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39106.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers, [[10:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39116.62s)]
*  but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can no longer pay. [[10:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39123.62s)]
*  How can it be when someone has to replace their car [[10:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39130.62s)]
*  but they can't afford to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[10:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39136.62s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? [[10:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39142.62s)]
*  It's impossible. [[10:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39146.62s)]
*  On the contrary, Conservatives will put an end to the tax on car workers proposed by Liberal Democrats, [[10:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39148.62s)]
*  and we will do otherwise. [[10:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39156.62s)]
*  We will eliminate the tax on cars made in Canada [[10:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39159.62s)]
*  to promote domestic production and bring jobs back to Canada. [[10:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39163.62s)]
*  So the choice with the Liberal Democrats is to pay a tax of $20,000 for gas cars. [[10:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39168.62s)]
*  With the Conservatives, you will pay less, [[10:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39174.62s)]
*  and no TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[10:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39178.62s)]
*  That's the choice. [[10:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39186.62s)]
*  Another fourth mandate of the Liberals, which will increase prices for everything, [[10:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39188.62s)]
*  or a change with the Conservatives, which will cut gas prices, [[10:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39192.62s)]
*  reduce taxes and make life more affordable. [[10:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39196.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39199.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39201.62s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[10:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39202.62s)]
*  Hello, Emilie. [[10:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39205.62s)]
*  Hello. [[10:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39206.62s)]
*  Hello. [[10:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39207.62s)]
*  Hello. [[10:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39208.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president spoke of the 51st Method in his call with Mark Carney, [[10:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39209.62s)]
*  while the Prime Minister had said that Trump had respected Canada's sovereignty during their discussion. [[10:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39215.62s)]
*  How do you interpret that? [[10:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39221.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. [[10:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39225.62s)]
*  I wasn't there. [[10:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39227.62s)]
*  It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain that. [[10:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39229.62s)]
*  I wasn't there, but I will say that Canada will never be an American state. [[10:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39233.62s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. [[10:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39239.62s)]
*  And that means we must focus on what we can control. [[10:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39242.62s)]
*  What can we control? [[10:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39248.62s)]
*  We can reverse the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised Justin Trudeau. [[10:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39250.62s)]
*  We must reverse the policies that increase taxes, debt and inflation, [[10:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39260.62s)]
*  and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[10:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39265.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[10:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39269.62s)]
*  We must reverse all liberal policies that have caused this dependence, [[10:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39277.62s)]
*  because after a decade of liberal policies that have increased the cost and made our economy fall, [[10:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39283.62s)]
*  we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[10:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39294.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new conservative government that will cut waste, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, [[10:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39298.62s)]
*  free the production of our resources and the construction of homes, [[10:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39306.62s)]
*  and bring our jobs here to keep Americans in control with force. [[10:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39310.62s)]
*  In English as well? [[10:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39317.62s)]
*  Thank you. That concludes today's press conference. [[10:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39319.62s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thank you. [[10:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39321.62s)]
*  Well, that's a question for Mr. Carney to answer. I wasn't there. [[10:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39323.62s)]
*  What's clear is we will stand up for our sovereignty. [[10:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39327.62s)]
*  We will never be an American state. [[10:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39330.62s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies [[10:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39332.62s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[10:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39337.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. [[10:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39344.62s)]
*  Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[10:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39348.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that liberals pushed south. [[10:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39354.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[10:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39367.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, [[10:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39372.62s)]
*  so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[10:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39380.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39387.62s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[10:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39388.62s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth mandate. [[10:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39395.62s)]
*  It must change with a new Conservative government that will reduce taxes and taxes, [[10:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39397.62s)]
*  build housing, free our natural resources, and rebuild our economic strength to make change. [[10:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39404.62s)]
*  It's great to be here in Nova Scotia in this change election. [[10:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39414.62s)]
*  And there is one word that describes the election. [[10:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39418.62s)]
*  Change. Change so you can afford food. Change so you can afford homes. [[10:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39422.62s)]
*  Change so that you are once again safe on your streets. [[10:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39426.62s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade of rising costs and crime and a falling economy under America's thumb, we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[10:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39429.62s)]
*  We need change. And that is what Conservatives will bring. [[10:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39441.62s)]
*  Today we're here with our incredible team that will bring that change. [[10:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39446.62s)]
*  We have Rick Perkins here. Where's Rick? Rick Perkins. Rick Perkins. [[10:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39451.62s)]
*  We've got Dr. Stephen Ellis. Dr. Ellis is here. Thank you, Dr. Ellis. [[10:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39459.62s)]
*  Rob Batherson, obviously, who spoke already. We've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau, and Chris Dalgamon. [[10:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39471.62s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. [[10:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39480.62s)]
*  And as you know, after this lost liberal decade, we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. [[10:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39483.62s)]
*  Change to lower the cost of living. Change so that our youth can afford homes. [[10:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39489.62s)]
*  Change to bring safe streets, good jobs, and powerful paychecks. [[10:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39493.62s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[10:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39497.62s)]
*  Again, for a change. [[10:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39501.62s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70 percent. [[10:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39503.62s)]
*  With less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and bureaucracy, we're going to cut handouts to insiders. [[10:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39509.62s)]
*  And we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[10:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39518.62s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[10:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39523.62s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[10:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39531.62s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[10:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39536.62s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[10:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39542.62s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[10:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39548.62s)]
*  More expensive food, homes, and cars. [[10:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39555.62s)]
*  Add it all up, and you can't afford a fourth term. [[10:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39558.62s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[10:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39562.62s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[10:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39567.62s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[10:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39572.62s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[10:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39580.62s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published about how the future looks. [[10:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39585.62s)]
*  They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[10:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39593.62s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[10:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39597.62s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[11:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39602.62s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory that the Liberals have created for us. [[11:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39606.62s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance and not through hard work. [[11:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39614.62s)]
*  It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[11:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39623.62s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[11:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39630.62s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[11:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39640.62s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. [[11:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39650.62s)]
*  Even more so, and more shockingly so, the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[11:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39654.62s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[11:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39662.62s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[11:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39668.62s)]
*  This in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world, [[11:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39679.62s)]
*  but the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[11:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39691.62s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint, [[11:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39702.62s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[11:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39713.62s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic and inequality between those who rent and those who own [[11:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39718.62s)]
*  will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict and that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[11:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39729.62s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[11:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39737.62s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[11:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39746.62s)]
*  Now, yesterday when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[11:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39752.62s)]
*  many people in the crowd said what you were describing is Canada today, the desperation that many people already feel, [[11:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39759.62s)]
*  a desperation that gets worse and worse after 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, [[11:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39768.62s)]
*  a mental health crisis and a loss of hope feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[11:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39775.62s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[11:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39780.62s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[11:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39787.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[11:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39800.62s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[11:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39808.62s)]
*  they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[11:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39815.62s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[11:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39823.62s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[11:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39831.62s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, [[11:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39840.62s)]
*  sell too many gas-powered vehicles. If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, [[11:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39846.62s)]
*  they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[11:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39856.62s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[11:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39862.62s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[11:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39876.62s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs [[11:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39884.62s)]
*  just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[11:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39893.62s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[11:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39901.62s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[11:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39910.62s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles [[11:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39916.62s)]
*  and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[11:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39925.62s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[11:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39931.62s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. [[11:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39940.62s)]
*  Tesla will benefit. Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, [[11:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39946.62s)]
*  sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[11:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39959.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[11:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39970.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, [[11:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39975.62s)]
*  EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[11:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39981.62s)]
*  We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[11:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=39991.62s)]
*  Don't get fooled by this policy, which is an attack on your paycheque. [[11:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40000.62s)]
*  And it hits directly on our workers in the automotive sector. [[11:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40005.62s)]
*  Independent economists like Ross McKittrick believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost our economy $138 billion. [[11:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40010.62s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[11:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40025.62s)]
*  Foreign automakers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[11:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40030.62s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[11:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40039.62s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold, and that number comes from tests between minus 7 and minus 15. [[11:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40046.62s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[11:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40070.62s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[11:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40082.62s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[11:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40089.62s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables to phase out internal combustion engines. [[11:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40093.62s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[11:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40104.62s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[11:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40110.62s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[11:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40116.62s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[11:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40125.62s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[11:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40135.62s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[11:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40144.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[11:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40150.62s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[11:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40156.62s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[11:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40161.62s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[11:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40167.62s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[11:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40174.62s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[11:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40193.62s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[11:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40200.62s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[11:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40205.62s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[11:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40209.62s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[11:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40230.62s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[11:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40237.62s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[11:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40244.62s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[11:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40257.62s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[11:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40267.62s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[11:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40278.62s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, and we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles, like axing the GST on those purchases. [[11:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40295.62s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from the first day in power. [[11:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40308.62s)]
*  The quotas are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[11:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40315.62s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[11:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40327.62s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[11:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40344.62s)]
*  I believe that Canadians should be able to choose. People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. They need a diesel-powered car. [[11:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40355.62s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[11:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40370.62s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles because we respect the contracts. [[11:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40390.62s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[11:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40420.62s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[11:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40434.62s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[11:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40445.62s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[11:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40462.62s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It could not be more clear. After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect the Liberals for a fourth term, with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[11:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40469.62s)]
*  Or do we want change, with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[11:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40487.62s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[11:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40505.62s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[11:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40518.62s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. Thank you very much. [[11:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40534.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40539.62s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[11:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40542.62s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[11:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40551.62s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[11:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40556.62s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[11:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40569.62s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[11:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40576.62s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. The right way is to bring our people together. [[11:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40580.62s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[11:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40592.62s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[11:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40605.62s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. We are one country. We're a proud country. And I owe everything to this country. [[11:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40619.62s)]
*  It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. And I'm going to give that back. My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[11:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40629.62s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[11:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40643.62s)]
*  Al Ponce. [[11:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40656.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40658.62s)]
*  You know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. We need change. We need change now more than ever. Change so that people have hope again. Something that has been lost these last few years. [[11:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40663.62s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. Vote for the candidate that you love. [[11:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40676.62s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. We need to unite our country around our promise. The promise of Canada that everyone who works hard should be able to buy a beautiful house on a safe street. [[11:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40689.62s)]
*  No matter your modest or advantageous origins, you should be able to work hard to realize your dreams. And that beautiful promise is what will bring Canadians together across Canada. [[11:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40705.62s)]
*  After the decade of lost Liberals, people have lost hope. They are more divided than ever. We cannot allow a fourth Liberal mandate. It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise and offer a beautiful, safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. Thank you very much. [[11:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40718.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Paulyev. Mitchell Bailey here with Global News. You're in the final days of the campaign. What made you decide to come to Nova Scotia now? And what have you been hearing from people here regarding their biggest concerns this election cycle? [[11:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40743.62s)]
*  Thank you. Well, it's never a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. It's great to be here. Every day is a good day in Nova Scotia. In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[11:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40755.62s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. And what I'm hearing is that people want change. They want change. After a lost Liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[11:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40778.62s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. And we can't afford a fourth Liberal term of rising costs and crime. The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. Change so that they can afford food and housing. Change so that they're safe on their streets. Change to put Canada first. [[11:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40797.62s)]
*  That is our mission. And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. A plan that, in fact, is called change. It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[11:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40817.62s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. We will unite our country. We will restore its promise. Thank you very much. [[11:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40841.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40858.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40859.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40860.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40862.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40864.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40894.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40924.62s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[11:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40939.62s)]
*  Good morning, Mr. Polyev. Pat Healy from the Laker News. [[11:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40941.62s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[11:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40945.62s)]
*  With the threat of U.S. tariffs impacting the auto industry, how would you work to ensure that impact is limited? [[11:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40946.62s)]
*  First of all, I will axe the Carney tax. Can you imagine in the middle of this trade dispute how irresponsible the Liberals and Mark Carney must be to contemplate a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made gas-powered vehicles? [[11:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40953.62s)]
*  It is utterly reckless. Not only is Mr. Carney continuing with the disastrous policies of Justin Trudeau, he wants to take them even further. [[11:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40973.62s)]
*  Taxing your vehicle at $20,000 will mean you won't be able to afford one. So when people's old vehicle is breaking down and they can't afford a new car, they can't afford the Carney tax. How are they going to get to work? What are they going to do? [[11:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40983.62s)]
*  And how are we going to keep jobs in this country when there's a new tax, liberal tax, on vehicles? [[11:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=40998.62s)]
*  I will axe that tax and I will let Canadians choose their own automobile. They will make their own decisions for themselves. [[11:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41005.62s)]
*  Rural people, suburban folks, need cars and trucks, and we need to protect their ability to make that decision. [[11:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41012.62s)]
*  Furthermore, we want to encourage Canadians to buy Canadian automobiles. So we will axe the sales tax on Canadian cars. [[11:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41021.62s)]
*  So here you have a choice. You vote for a fourth Liberal term, you're going to get a $20,000 tax on your gas-powered automobile. [[11:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41031.62s)]
*  You vote Conservative, you're going to get a tax-free vehicle that is made in Canada, knowing that you'll be creating jobs for fellow Canadians and strengthening our economy. [[11:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41042.62s)]
*  This is the way we need to go. We need to put our country first for a change, put taxpayers first for a change, put affordable cars and trucks first for a change. Thank you. [[11:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41054.62s)]
*  With the tariff war, it's irresponsible for Mr. Carney to propose a tax of $20,000 for gas-powered cars and diesel. [[11:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41072.62s)]
*  It will kill jobs for car workers, but it will also increase the cost of living for Canadians who can't afford to pay. [[11:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41094.62s)]
*  How can someone replace their car when they don't have the means to pay another $20,000 in tax? [[11:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41107.62s)]
*  What will they do to get to work? It's impossible. On the contrary, the Conservatives will put an end to the tax on automobiles proposed by the Liberals. [[11:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41120.62s)]
*  And we will do otherwise. We will eliminate the sales tax on Canadian automobiles to promote domestic production and bring jobs back to Canada. [[11:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41134.62s)]
*  So the choice is that with the Liberals, you will pay a $20,000 tax on gasoline cars. With the Conservatives, you will pay less than a TPS on new cars and trucks made in Canada. [[11:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41146.62s)]
*  That's the choice. Another fourth mandate from the Liberals will increase prices for everything, or a change with the Conservatives, which will cut gas taxes, reduce taxes and make life more affordable. Thank you very much. [[11:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41163.62s)]
*  Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[11:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41178.62s)]
*  Hello, Émilie Descoteaux, Radio-Canada. [[11:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41181.62s)]
*  Hello. [[11:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41185.62s)]
*  We learned that the American president spoke of the 51st State in his call with Mark Carney, while the Prime Minister said that Trump had respected the sovereignty of Canada during their discussion. How do you interpret this? [[11:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41186.62s)]
*  Mr. Carney said the opposite. I wasn't there. It's clear that Mr. Carney has to explain this. I wasn't on the call, but I will say that Canada would never be an American state. [[11:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41201.62s)]
*  We must defend our sovereignty. And that means focusing on what we can control. What can we control? [[11:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41215.62s)]
*  We can overthrow the disastrous liberal policies that Mr. Carney advised to Justin Trudeau. [[11:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41226.62s)]
*  The policies to increase taxes, debts and inflation, and to expel $500 billion of investment in the United States. [[11:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41236.62s)]
*  The policies that have blocked our natural resources and given our oil to Americans at low prices. [[11:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41245.62s)]
*  We must overthrow all liberal policies that have caused this dependence. [[11:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41253.62s)]
*  Because after a decade of loss of the Liberals, which has increased the cost and made our economy fall, we cannot pay the price of a fourth liberal mandate. [[11:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41260.62s)]
*  We need a change with a new Conservative government that will cut gas, bureaucracy, taxes and taxes, free the production of our resources and the construction of houses, [[11:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41274.62s)]
*  and bring our jobs back here to keep Americans in check with force. [[11:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41287.62s)]
*  But what's clear is that we will stand up for our sovereignty. We will never be an American state. [[11:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41304.62s)]
*  And we will focus on what we can control, which is to reverse the disastrous liberal economic policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau to take, [[11:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41309.62s)]
*  which have driven up the cost of living and driven our jobs south. [[11:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41317.62s)]
*  My approach is to bring change. Change by cutting bureaucracy, taxes and bringing down the cost of living. [[11:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41321.62s)]
*  Change by unleashing the construction of new homes and Canadian resources to bring back the half trillion dollars that Liberals pushed south. [[11:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41331.62s)]
*  Change so that Canadians can create jobs here at home. [[11:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41344.62s)]
*  My plan will cut taxes on work, investment, home building and energy, so that we can unleash production and powerful paychecks and stand up for our country from a position of strength for a change. [[11:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41348.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41363.62s)]
*  Thank you everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[11:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41365.62s)]
*  Thank you to the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of [[11:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41378.62s)]
*  Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister [[11:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41408.62s)]
*  of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister [[11:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41414.18s)]
*  of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister [[11:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41419.3s)]
*  of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Health, the Minister [[11:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41424.600000000006s)]
*  Rick Perkins, Dr. Steven Ellis, Dr. Alice is here, thank you Dr. Alice. [[11:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41431.68s)]
*  Rob Batherson obviously who spoke already, we've got Joe Hurdle, Mark Goudreau and Chris Daltona. [[11:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41448.68s)]
*  And we're here today with our plan to bring change. You know, after this lost liberal decade, [[11:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41457.68s)]
*  we need change and we need a plan to deliver that change. Change to lower the cost of living. [[11:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41462.68s)]
*  Change so that our youth can afford homes. Change to bring safe streets, good jobs and powerful paychecks. [[11:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41467.68s)]
*  To unleash our resources in order to stand up to the Americans from a position of strength. [[11:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41473.68s)]
*  Again, for a change. Over the next four years, my plan will cut the liberal deficit by 70% [[11:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41478.68s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and bureaucracy. [[11:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41486.68s)]
*  We're going to cut handouts to insiders and we're going to unleash our economy to build more homes and develop our resources. [[11:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41491.68s)]
*  By contrast, Mr. Carney's planned deficit is going to be even higher than what Justin Trudeau promised. [[11:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41500.68s)]
*  Not only is he promising to keep all of the spending that Trudeau had budgeted, [[11:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41508.68s)]
*  he's promising to add another $130 billion on top of it. [[11:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41513.68s)]
*  Combining Trudeau's planned spending with Mark Carney's new promises, [[11:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41519.68s)]
*  Liberals will add a quarter trillion dollars to our national debt, which will drive up prices for everything. [[11:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41525.68s)]
*  More expensive food, homes and cars. Add it all up and you can't afford a fourth term. [[11:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41532.68s)]
*  To pay for the debt, the Liberals will have to print even more money, hike taxes even higher, [[11:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41539.68s)]
*  with inflation driving up the costs and preventing our people from affording a decent life. [[11:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41544.68s)]
*  Just like they did for the last five years when Mark Carney was acting as Justin Trudeau's economic adviser. [[11:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41549.68s)]
*  We've seen the rapid decline over the last decade in our quality of life. [[11:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41557.68s)]
*  I don't know if you saw this story this week, but this incredible report that the government has published [[11:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41562.68s)]
*  about how the future looks. They call it Future Lives, Social Mobility in Question. [[11:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41567.68s)]
*  One section says, 2040, more snakes than ladders. [[11:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41573.68s)]
*  In this report, it's not just about the last lost Liberal decade. [[11:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41578.68s)]
*  It's about how miserable life will become and how costly it will become on the current trajectory [[11:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41583.68s)]
*  that the Liberals have created for us. [[11:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41589.68s)]
*  The report that the government publishes says that the people will only be able to get ahead through inheritance [[11:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41592.68s)]
*  and not through hard work. It says that homes will become even more expensive, that the economy will shrink, [[11:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41599.68s)]
*  that property ownership and by extension wealth may become even more concentrated [[11:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41607.68s)]
*  if younger generations abandon the idea of buying single-family dwellings. [[11:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41613.68s)]
*  We see here that the government is warning that over the next 15 years, [[11:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41617.68s)]
*  more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. [[11:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41622.68s)]
*  Many workers might have to leave the country. And even more so, and more shockingly so, [[11:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41627.68s)]
*  the government says that because groceries will be unaffordable and out of reach, [[11:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41633.68s)]
*  people will have to hunt, fish and forage in public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[11:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41638.68s)]
*  In other words, people will have no choice but to actually break rules in order to scrounge for food on public lands. [[11:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41645.68s)]
*  This, in Canada, a country blessed with the most natural resources [[11:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41655.68s)]
*  and should be the land of the most opportunity anywhere in the world. [[11:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41661.68s)]
*  But the trajectory we were on after the lost Liberal decade, were it to continue, [[11:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41667.68s)]
*  would lead to more despair, more inflation and higher costs. [[11:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41674.68s)]
*  Now, I believe this report should be on the front page of every newspaper [[11:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41678.68s)]
*  because people need to know the terrifying picture that a fourth Liberal term will paint [[11:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41683.68s)]
*  of higher costs, of raging crime, of more despair. [[11:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41690.68s)]
*  This report says that owning a home in 2040 will not be realistic. [[11:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41695.68s)]
*  An inequality between those who rent and those who own will have become a driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[11:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41703.68s)]
*  And that people may lose faith in the Canadian project. [[11:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41710.68s)]
*  It sounds like an incredible TV series, how ugly they describe the future in this Government of Canada report. [[11:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41714.68s)]
*  And they're not talking about 100 years from now, they're talking about 15 years down the road. [[11:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41723.68s)]
*  Now yesterday, when I was at a rally here in Nova Scotia, and I read off some of the excerpts of this report, [[11:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41728.68s)]
*  many people in the crowd said, what you were describing is Canada today. [[11:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41736.68s)]
*  The desperation that many people already feel, a desperation that gets worse and worse. [[11:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41741.68s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, the predictions of housing shortages, a mental health crisis and a loss of hope [[11:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41747.68s)]
*  feel like the present to a lot of Canadians. [[11:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41754.68s)]
*  Already many Canadians cannot afford a new home and thanks to Liberals, you don't have the ability to buy a car either. [[11:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41757.68s)]
*  And I'm talking about what Mark Carney calls the zero emissions vehicle mandate. [[11:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41765.68s)]
*  Or let's call it what it really is, a $20,000 Carney tax. [[11:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41772.68s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[11:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41778.68s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, they will face a $20,000 per vehicle tax, [[11:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41788.68s)]
*  which will obviously be passed on to consumers. [[11:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41798.68s)]
*  Now, that's not a penalty for the car company, they'll just pass it on. It's a penalty for you, the consumer. [[11:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41801.68s)]
*  If you want to buy a vehicle that is gas-powered, then you will very likely face taxes on that vehicle if the Liberals are re-elected. [[11:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41808.68s)]
*  Starting next year, the Liberals are going to punish auto manufacturers who, in the opinion of Liberals, sell too many gas-powered vehicles. [[11:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41817.68s)]
*  If a company sells even one car over the Government-imposed quota, they will have to pay a fine of up to $20,000 per vehicle. [[11:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41826.68s)]
*  This is not a penalty for the car manufacturer, it's a new tax that will be imposed on you, the buyer, if you want to buy a car that is gas-powered or hybrid. [[11:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41839.68s)]
*  This is Mark Carney's vision for Canada, a country where you don't get to choose what kind of car you drive, [[11:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41853.68s)]
*  where prices on everything skyrocket to fund his radical ideology, [[11:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41860.68s)]
*  where Canadian workers in places like Oshawa and Windsor face losing their jobs just to justify the ideological fantasies of out-of-touch bankers and Liberal ideologues, [[11:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41865.68s)]
*  people who spend too much of their adult life outside of Canada, disconnected from the reality of Canadian life. [[11:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41878.68s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, this is an attack on your paycheck, and it's a direct hit to the autoworkers. [[11:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41887.68s)]
*  Independent economist Dr. Ross McKittrick estimates that this liberal ban on gas-powered vehicles and the attacks that it applies on the remaining vehicles that are allowed to be sold [[11:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41893.68s)]
*  will kill 38,000 Canadian auto sector jobs and cost our economy $138 billion. [[11:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41908.68s)]
*  That's billion with a B. And who benefits from all this? Foreign automakers. Tesla will benefit. [[11:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41917.68s)]
*  Mark Carney wants you to pay a $20,000 tax on a gas-powered vehicle to pay credits to Tesla, a foreign automaker, sending our money and our jobs abroad once again. [[11:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41925.68s)]
*  No wonder Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[11:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41939.68s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[11:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41946.68s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[11:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41952.68s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus seven and minus 15. We all know that in Canada it gets a lot colder than that. [[11:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41962.68s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January when it's minus 25 or colder. [[11:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41971.68s)]
*  Don't get it wrong. This policy is an attack on your paycheque. And it strikes directly. [[11:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41977.68s)]
*  Our workers in the automotive sector, independent economists like Ross McKittrick, believe that this mandate could eliminate 38,000 jobs in the automotive industry and cost $138 billion to our economy. [[11:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=41985.68s)]
*  We're talking about billions. And who's going to benefit? Tesla. [[11:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42002.68s)]
*  Foreign car manufacturers, American workers, even Donald Trump says he prefers when Liberals run Canada and keep the economy weak and costly. [[11:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42007.68s)]
*  Of course he does, because their disastrous economic policies send our jobs straight south. [[11:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42016.68s)]
*  And there's another big problem, the cars themselves. According to the Canadian Automobile Association, EVs can lose up to 40% of their battery life in the cold. [[11:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42023.68s)]
*  And that number comes from tests between minus seven and minus 15. [[11:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42037.68s)]
*  So try in Saskatchewan in January or another highway in the great north of Canada where it's minus 25. [[11:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42046.68s)]
*  But Mr. Carney won't stop with taxing gas-powered vehicles. He wants to get rid of those vehicles altogether. [[11:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42058.68s)]
*  Listen to the quote from his book, which he wrote just four years ago. [[11:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42065.68s)]
*  Carney wrote that we need to quote, use the regulatory policy to frame the future direction of our economy, such as explicit timetables to phase out internal combustion engines. [[11:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42070.68s)]
*  These measures are critical, he says. And that's exactly what he plans to do. [[11:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42081.68s)]
*  The Liberals have set a deadline to ban new gas-powered vehicles altogether by 2035. [[11:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42087.68s)]
*  But that ban is phased in starting next year. In other words, this is not a tomorrow problem. This is a now problem. [[11:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42093.68s)]
*  Dealerships like this one across Canada have no idea how they're going to meet these timelines, how they're going to continue operating and selling vehicles. [[11:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42102.68s)]
*  Many will have to lay off salespeople and other staff, and many more will have to raise prices dramatically on Canadian consumers. [[11:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42112.68s)]
*  This at a time when our economy is at record weakness and our consumers are taxed to the max. [[11:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42121.68s)]
*  Mr. Carney doesn't care if your family has to choose between affording a warm home or a working car. [[11:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42127.68s)]
*  He doesn't care if a young couple trying to start a life can't afford their first vehicle. [[11:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42133.68s)]
*  Well, we've got news for Mr. Carney. Canadians are taking back control of their lives for a change. [[11:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42138.68s)]
*  A new Conservative government will axe the Carney tax. [[11:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42144.68s)]
*  We will axe the Carney tax for a change. We will axe the Carney tax to revitalize our auto sector and to make vehicles more affordable. [[11:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42151.68s)]
*  No $20,000 tax on gas-powered cars, no permanent bans on the cars you love and rely on. [[11:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42170.68s)]
*  Let me be clear. I have nothing against electric cars. If you want one, buy one. [[11:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42177.68s)]
*  Free choice. Make your own decision. I encourage you to buy one that's made in Canada. [[11:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42181.68s)]
*  And I go even further to say that a Conservative government would bring real change and axe the federal sales tax on any vehicles made in Canada so that you can save by buying Canadian. [[11:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42186.68s)]
*  And that will allow us to bring back production and paychecks to Canada while making automobiles more affordable. [[11:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42207.68s)]
*  And there's your choice. You vote Conservative and you get a tax cut on a Canadian-made car. [[11:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42214.68s)]
*  You vote for the Liberals to have a fourth term in power and you vote for a $20,000 tax on Canadian-made automobiles, all to benefit Tesla and other foreign automakers. [[11:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42221.68s)]
*  Conservatives will put you back in the driver's seat for a change. You will decide what's good for you and your family. You will decide what to do with your money. [[11:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42234.68s)]
*  Conservatives will maintain clean incentives and continue to back the auto sector. We will honour all agreements for the auto sector that the government has made. [[11:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42244.68s)]
*  But we will not force Canadians to pay a $20,000 tax on automobiles. We will continue to support the battery plants, the EVs, and the other commitments the government has made because we don't believe in tearing up agreements. [[11:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42255.68s)]
*  We believe in supporting Canadian jobs right here in Canada, and we will go even further with powerful incentives for Canadians to buy Canadian-made automobiles like axing the GST on those purchases. [[11:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42272.68s)]
*  A Conservative government will cut the tax on vehicles from the first day in power. [[11:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42285.68s)]
*  The tax cuts are over. The $20,000 tax on electric cars is over. The permanent restrictions on cars you like and which you depend on are over. [[11:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42292.68s)]
*  To be clear, if people want an electric car, they should be able to choose it. It is a personal choice that we respect, but we will not force this choice on Canadians. It is a free choice. [[11:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42304.68s)]
*  But in the regions, people need cars. I will end the war against the autos of the Liberals and the Bloc. [[11:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42321.68s)]
*  I believe Canadians should be able to choose. People in the regions of Quebec cannot survive only with electric cars. They need a diesel-powered car. [[11:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42331.68s)]
*  We will also support highways instead of trying to put everything in electric cars and a tramway. [[11:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42346.68s)]
*  In Quebec, the choice is between the Liberals and the Bloc, who simply want a tramway, or the Conservatives, who prefer a third link. [[11:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42356.68s)]
*  We will respect all existing agreements on the construction of electric vehicles because we respect the contracts. [[11:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42366.68s)]
*  We will make bold changes so that your life becomes affordable. We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off and you bring home more of each dollar you earn. [[11:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42396.68s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes and incentivize municipalities to cut their development taxes to bring down housing costs by $100,000. [[11:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42411.68s)]
*  We will sell off federal land to build 300,000 additional homes and we will incentivize all levels of government to speed up building permits by 15% every year, all of which will lead to 2.3 million new homes built over the next half decade. [[11:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42422.68s)]
*  This will allow us to bring home jobs for construction workers and homes for deserving families. [[11:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42439.68s)]
*  The choice in this election is about change. It cannot be more clear. [[11:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42446.68s)]
*  After a lost Liberal decade of rising costs and crime, are we going to elect Liberals for a fourth term with a reckless plan by Mark Carney to add even more spending than Trudeau? [[11:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42451.68s)]
*  Or do we want change with a new Conservative government that will cut bureaucracy, consultants and foreign aid by $55 billion, lower taxes for Canadians and unleash home building and resources so we can stand up for ourselves in a position of strength? [[11:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42464.68s)]
*  After the lost Liberal decade, we can't afford four more years. [[11:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42482.68s)]
*  Struggling Canadians can no longer afford to pay exorbitant grocery bills, housing bills and now automobile bills. [[11:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42486.68s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will focus relentlessly on bringing down the cost of living, ending Liberal inflation, restoring Canada's promise, where hard work gets you a beautiful life in a nice, affordable home, on a safe street under our proud flag. [[11:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42495.68s)]
*  That's what it means to bring change. Now, let's bring it home. [[11:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42511.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42515.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42517.68s)]
*  We will now take questions from the floor. Please say your name and outlet. [[11:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42519.68s)]
*  Hi, it's Sheldon McLeod from MBS News. [[11:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42528.68s)]
*  The parties, the leaders for the last number of weeks, for the last number of years have been telling us how they are different from each other, but after Monday, whoever forms government, the Prime Minister will be the Prime Minister of the entire country, not just the supporters that they have. [[11:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42533.68s)]
*  So what is your plan to bring our country together to face the challenges that are in our future? [[11:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42546.68s)]
*  Yes, that's a very good question. [[11:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42553.68s)]
*  Canadians have been divided by their government over the last decade. They've been told to turn against each other. I think that's the wrong way. [[11:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42556.68s)]
*  The right way is to bring our people together. [[11:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42566.68s)]
*  You know, what unites this country is what I call the Canadian promise, that it doesn't matter where you come from, it matters where you're going. [[11:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42570.68s)]
*  If you work hard, you should get a great life. [[11:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42579.68s)]
*  It doesn't matter if you've been here for, your family's been here for six generations or if you've been here for six weeks. [[11:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42582.68s)]
*  If you're prepared to put your shoulder to the wheel and work hard, you should give a great life and a beautiful home on a safe street. [[11:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42588.68s)]
*  And I'm going to rekindle that promise and unite people around that purpose. [[11:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42596.68s)]
*  We are one country. We're a proud country. [[11:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42602.68s)]
*  And I owe everything to this country. It gave me a start from a very humble beginning to be able to stand before you at this stage. [[11:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42605.68s)]
*  And I'm going to give that back. [[11:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42612.68s)]
*  My goal is to make sure that every single kid who's born in this country has that same opportunity. [[11:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42614.68s)]
*  Every single senior that's worked hard their entire life has a dignified retirement. [[11:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42620.68s)]
*  So let us unite our country around that shared promise and let's bring home change for the future. Thank you. [[11:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42625.68s)]
*  Al-Ponse. [[11:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42633.68s)]
*  I should say that, you know, the thing that will bring us together now is change. [[11:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42639.68s)]
*  We need change. We need change now more than ever. [[11:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42643.68s)]
*  Change so that people have hope again. [[11:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42647.68s)]
*  Something that has been lost these last few years. [[11:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42650.68s)]
*  And change is going to be on the horizon on Monday. [[11:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42653.68s)]
*  I ask every single Canadian get out and exercise your democratic right. [[11:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42657.68s)]
*  Vote for a change. Vote for an affordable, safe life. [[11:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42661.68s)]
*  Vote for the candidate you love. [[11:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42665.68s)]
*  Work hard. [[11:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42687.68s)]
*  Work hard. [[11:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42688.68s)]
*  Make your dreams come true. [[11:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42689.68s)]
*  And this beautiful promise is what will unite Canadians across Canada. [[11:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42690.68s)]
*  After the decade of lost liberals, people have lost hope. [[11:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42695.68s)]
*  They are more divided than ever. [[11:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42701.68s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate. [[11:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42704.68s)]
*  It needs to change with a new Conservative government that will unite Canadians around this promise [[11:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42706.68s)]
*  and offer a safe and affordable life to everyone to make change. [[11:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42713.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42718.68s)]
*  In fact, I think my friend Rick Perkins here thought that we should spend all of the 36 days of the campaign in Nova Scotia and never leave. [[11:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42743.68s)]
*  It's an incredible honour to be back. [[11:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42755.68s)]
*  And what I'm hearing is that people want change. [[11:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42758.68s)]
*  They want change. [[11:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42761.68s)]
*  After a lost liberal decade, Nova Scotians cannot afford to eat, heat or house themselves. [[11:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42762.68s)]
*  Housing costs have risen more in Halifax than in any other city in the country. [[11:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42768.68s)]
*  The drug addiction crisis and crime crisis is raging out of control. [[11:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42774.68s)]
*  And we can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs and crime. [[11:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42778.68s)]
*  The people of Nova Scotia and Canada need a change. [[11:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42784.68s)]
*  Change so that they can afford food and housing. [[11:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42788.68s)]
*  Change so that they're safe on their streets. [[11:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42790.68s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[11:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42792.68s)]
*  That is our mission. [[11:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42794.68s)]
*  And we're here with a plan to deliver that change. [[11:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42796.68s)]
*  A plan that, in fact, is called change. [[11:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42799.68s)]
*  It will give Nova Scotians back their paychecks by lowering income tax by 15%. [[11:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42802.68s)]
*  It will axe the federal sales tax on new homes. [[11:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42809.68s)]
*  It will lock up violent criminals to keep Canadians safe nationwide. [[11:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42812.68s)]
*  And so I'm here with a hopeful message for Nova Scotians that a bright future and a wonderful change is just around the corner. [[11:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42817.68s)]
*  If you vote for a Conservative government, you will get that change. [[11:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42825.68s)]
*  We will unite our country. [[11:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42829.68s)]
*  We will restore its promise. [[11:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42830.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42831.68s)]
*  In French. [[11:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42832.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42840.68s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42841.68s)]
*  It's not a bad time to go to Nova Scotia. [[11:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42843.68s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[11:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42849.68s)]
*  It's a very beautiful province. [[11:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42851.68s)]
*  It's a pleasure to be here to talk about change. [[11:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42853.68s)]
*  People need change. [[11:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42856.68s)]
*  Through the visits I've had, people are suffering. [[11:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42859.68s)]
*  The cost of food has exploded 37% faster here in Canada than in the United States in the last five years. [[11:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXhTS3_Yrek&t=42864.68s)]
