Video Description: Reform UK's leader, Nigel Farage, demanded that the Starmer govt create a 'minister for deportations' as he lashed out at Labour and the Tories ahead of next week's local elections. The Reform UK leader used a campaign speech to demand that 'somebody somewhere in government' - which already has an immigration minister - is held accountable for the matter.

# LIVE | Farage challenges UK PM Starmer on illegal migration: 'Appoint minister of Deportations…'
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms)
*  out of the fact we've managed to put more candidates in the field for May the 1st than any other party. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=0.0s)]
*  But today I wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and one that perhaps doesn't impact on the May the 1st elections [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=10.24s)]
*  but you would be wrong. Indeed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  the population explosion that has happened in this country has had [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17.56s)]
*  a bigger effect on the lives of more people [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21.12s)]
*  than any other single issue. And it's interesting because [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24.2s)]
*  up until 1997 this wasn't even a political debate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=29.52s)]
*  Indeed when I was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=33.84s)]
*  immigration didn't appear in my election literature [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  or a manifesto at all. And that's because simply [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=42.44s)]
*  from Windrush right up until Mr Blair became Prime Minister [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=45.72s)]
*  net migration into Britain had run at an average of 30 [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=49.68s)]
*  to 50,000 people a year. Sometimes higher [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=53.64s)]
*  sometimes lower. It wasn't even a debate [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=57.32s)]
*  in successive general elections. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=60.92s)]
*  But the Labour Party under Blair decided that diversity [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=63.92s)]
*  was a good thing. Something that was never ever [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=67.64s)]
*  to be questioned and that mass immigration would be good for the economy [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=70.84s)]
*  would make us all better off and frankly [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=75.72s)]
*  anybody that dared to even question this [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=79.36s)]
*  up until at least 2010 was considered [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=82.4s)]
*  completely and utterly beyond the pale. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=85.64s)]
*  The worst of the worst. And I know this because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  I first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=92.8s)]
*  when it became pretty obvious to me that opening up the door [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=96.32s)]
*  to eight and then ten former communist countries [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=99.83999999999999s)]
*  some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  of ours would lead to a huge inflow of people. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  Although at least in those days people that came did actually work. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=111.08s)]
*  That sadly has now all changed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=115.44s)]
*  And since then in every single general election [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=119.76s)]
*  we've been made a series of promises that frankly [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=123.4s)]
*  amount to little more than a pack of lies. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=126.92s)]
*  The public being told what the parties think [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=130.28s)]
*  the public want to hear. In fact no from polling [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=133.52s)]
*  what the public want to hear without any [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=136.76s)]
*  intention of delivering on it at all. Of course the Conservatives [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=139.96s)]
*  far worse than Tony Blair. Net migration to tens of thousands [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=143.6s)]
*  promised in 2010, 2015, 2017 and then 2019 [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=147.52s)]
*  we were told substantially lower numbers. We now have a Labour government [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=152.48s)]
*  who've promised they will radically bring down the numbers [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=156.64s)]
*  coming into Britain and we'll find out in June [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=160.56s)]
*  when we get the first ONS data whether that's true or the way very [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=162.8s)]
*  much doubt it. We've been told by successive Prime Ministers they would [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=166.72s)]
*  stop the boats even that they would smash the gangs. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=170.4s)]
*  Well I'm afraid none of it has come true. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=174.8s)]
*  And I think it's about time we looked at the true [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  cost of the population explosion to this country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=181.76s)]
*  And I want to make this point very clear that recent polling particularly polling [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  that was published last week in the Sun newspaper [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=190.24s)]
*  which was the whole of the Midlands of the North showed that we are now by far [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=194.16s)]
*  the most trusted party on this issue and that I am by far [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=199.04s)]
*  the most trusted leader to do something about it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=203.52s)]
*  It'll be good for the economy is what we were told well 30 years ago 7% of the [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=208.08s)]
*  workforce were foreign born. Today 21% of the workforce are foreign born. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=212.32s)]
*  That has directly led to a pay cut on average of about 3% per worker which of course [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=218.48000000000002s)]
*  doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money but if you're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=224.56s)]
*  earning 20,000 pounds a year it does mean quite a lot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=227.52s)]
*  And interestingly the Bank of England in 2015 produced a report showing a direct [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  link between numbers of foreign born workers and wage suppression yet the whole thing was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=235.36s)]
*  completely and utterly covered up. The impact of course on wages is worse [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=242.4s)]
*  than that given that there are 500,000 700,000 who knows people working in the illegal economy [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=247.12s)]
*  leading to further wage suppression. The greatest myth of course is that it [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=255.36s)]
*  will be good for us and you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=262.16s)]
*  has come to work. Well try this statistic for size. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=265.52000000000004s)]
*  Foreign born workers are 40% higher likely to be unemployed than British born workers. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=270.24s)]
*  40% higher for foreign born people to be on the unemployment register. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=278.56s)]
*  It's not a statistic I'd ever heard before. It's pretty mind-blowing. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=284.56s)]
*  And even the argument that look most people come here to work so what is there to complain about? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=289.44s)]
*  Well I'm afraid that doesn't work either because in the last six years net three million people [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=295.12s)]
*  have settled in Britain from outside of Europe and of those only 16% came on work visas. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=302.0s)]
*  It's a completely mind-blowing number. Now it's true to say that many of those who've [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=310.08s)]
*  perhaps will enter the workforce but you begin to understand that the argument for mass migration [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  that is needed for the labour market actually isn't true where the majority that come come [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=320.32s)]
*  as dependents. The Centre for Migration Studies recently published that since 2020 [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=326.4s)]
*  unemployment benefits to foreign born people have been 36 billion pounds. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=332.64s)]
*  We are talking simply about eye watering numbers. The other statistic that I was surprised by was [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=338.48s)]
*  that low-paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer 150,000 pounds by the time they reach [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=346.24s)]
*  retirement let alone what that will be afterwards. So let us be clear non-selective in many cases [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=352.72s)]
*  non-working mass migration into Britain has made everybody in this country poorer except of course [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=361.04s)]
*  for big employers who love much cheap migrant foreign labour as they can possibly get their [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=369.36s)]
*  hands on as the argument grows every year that British people simply won't do those jobs. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=375.20000000000005s)]
*  But we're told it's okay because we're growing we're getting richer. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=384.56s)]
*  And that's the only measure that anybody on the two front benches in parliament will ever talk about. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=388.0s)]
*  I did try the other day with Rachel Reeves and she's trying too but I did try to make the argument [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=398.0s)]
*  that actually GDP in gross figures doesn't mean very much when you have a population that's rising [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=405.68s)]
*  by three quarters of a million or a million every year directly as a result of open borders. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=412.0s)]
*  Why not look at GDP per capita? But no nobody wants to engage with that. Well the last two years [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  have seen record levels of migration into Britain and GDP per capita has fallen in six of the last [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=424.64000000000004s)]
*  eight quarters. We are getting poorer as a result of policies started by the Labour Party accelerated [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=432.48s)]
*  by the Conservative Party and now being continued by Labour. None of which of course means that we [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=440.32s)]
*  in this country don't want high skilled law abiding people to come into Britain to work, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=446.8s)]
*  pay taxes, add to our society, all of those things are good. But we have to we have to discriminate [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=453.2s)]
*  yes that's that's the word I'm going to use it means choose. We have to discriminate in terms of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=460.64s)]
*  who comes into our country and in what numbers. To try to have a rational debate about housing is [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=465.6s)]
*  virtually impossible. I've been trying for over 10 years to engage other party leaders in a rational [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=473.68s)]
*  debate about the terrible housing shortage, the cost of housing and rents in this country. Nobody [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=480.0s)]
*  will engage with me. Of the house price rises that we've had over the last two decades [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=486.16s)]
*  25% of that is directly down to immigration and the rising population. Indeed even the Ministry [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  of Housing themselves said in 2018 again suppressed not publicized that a 1% increase in the number of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=502.08s)]
*  households leads to a 2% increase in cost and just think on this there were 23.7 million households [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=510.79999999999995s)]
*  when Mr Blair came to power there are now 28.5 million households. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=518.56s)]
*  Net migration has increased the population by 10 million in the last 20 years and the same goes [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  for rent even in recent years a third of rent rises since 2020 are directly down to rising [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=532.56s)]
*  population which means for the average renter another thousand pounds a year and think on this [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=539.28s)]
*  this government is determined to build one and a half million new homes in the lifetime of this [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=547.44s)]
*  parliament just as the government before was committed to the same figure that will not have [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=552.1600000000001s)]
*  any impact on the housing crisis in Britain in any way at all. We currently have to build a new [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=558.1600000000001s)]
*  house every two minutes yes that's right we have to build one new house every two minutes just to [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=564.96s)]
*  cope with levels of net migration into Britain not dealing at all with the backlog that we've [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=572.8s)]
*  built up and perhaps one of the areas that is causing the most angst is social housing and we [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=579.76s)]
*  know we do have a shortage of social housing stock in our country but somebody who comes into the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=585.3599999999999s)]
*  Port of Dover a young man without any documents who's come from goodness knows where who believes in [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=592.0799999999999s)]
*  who knows what once they once they give an indefinite leave to remain and we increasingly [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=597.28s)]
*  do that because we find it too difficult to deport anybody anywhere they then effectively are homeless [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=602.48s)]
*  which means of course they go straight to the top of the of the social housing list [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=609.1999999999999s)]
*  it's happening in every county just one example Northumberland last year hundreds of asylum [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=613.68s)]
*  seekers who were given indefinite leave to remain went straight to the top of the housing queue [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=619.6s)]
*  whilst there were 14 000 people families on the list who were put i'm afraid to the back that's [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=623.92s)]
*  just one county example but it's happening literally everywhere but it's okay we're told [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=630.0799999999999s)]
*  we wouldn't be able to have a national health service if it wasn't for increasing net migration [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=635.04s)]
*  into Britain that is what we've been told over and over and over and you'll still hear those [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=639.92s)]
*  arguments on BBC Question Time pretty much every week we need foreign doctors and nurses well i [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  would put a different argument to you i would say we should probably be ashamed of ourselves [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=651.28s)]
*  for taking over a hundred thousand doctors and nurses from the red list from under developed [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=655.92s)]
*  countries where undoubtedly those medical experts are needed even more than they're needed here [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=663.68s)]
*  amazing to think 100 000 workers in 25 years coming from countries that need them more than us and yet [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=670.8s)]
*  right at the moment we only have nine and a half thousand people in medical training of any kind [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=675.76s)]
*  at all it's almost as if the nhs is happier to take on agency staff from west africa [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=681.52s)]
*  and we've sort of lost the idea that we should be training enough of our own doctors and nurses [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=689.04s)]
*  and perhaps one of the biggest political issues in britain that affects people's lives is access [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=695.12s)]
*  to a gp appointment something that we pretty much took as a birthright to be honest well have a [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=699.12s)]
*  think about this 7.2 million foreign-born people have registered with gps in the last 10 years [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=704.8s)]
*  and you're surprised you can't get an nhs appointment all i'm doing here is giving you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=714.64s)]
*  cold hard facts all of which i can back up if you want further documentation i'm telling you the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  truth about the terrible terrible mistakes that have been made by both of our so-called main [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=728.4799999999999s)]
*  parties and one that is very difficult to talk about because you're always told that you're [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=734.0s)]
*  scapegoating you're saying something that is truly beastly is crime mass immigration has [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=739.2s)]
*  increased crime in this country in actually quite a dramatic way foreign-born nationals are 71 [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=745.76s)]
*  more likely to be convicted of sexual assault 69 more likely to be convicted of drug offenses [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=754.64s)]
*  39 more likely to be convicted of any kind of crime one in 50 albanians in britain is in jail [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=764.0s)]
*  now what does that tell you does it tell you that the whole of albania is rotten that they're all [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=773.68s)]
*  awful no what it tells you is if you come from a poorer country there are richer pickings in crime [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=777.6s)]
*  in london and birmingham and manchester and frankly even dover than there are where you come from [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=784.4s)]
*  is why i return to my point we must discriminate when it comes to who can come into our country [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=790.32s)]
*  we must choose who the right people are regardless of race religion or geography are these people [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=797.44s)]
*  going to contribute to british society are these people going to integrate in british society [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=804.08s)]
*  we've allowed foreign criminal gangs now to dominate london streets it's been going on for [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=811.84s)]
*  years and nobody even dares talk about it and don't even get me started on the turkish barber [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=816.64s)]
*  shops i mean i've been talking about this for some years i even raised it when i announced that i was [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=823.04s)]
*  going to stand in a general election last year on the third of june several in the press corps i [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=829.84s)]
*  just thought i was off my rocker and they probably still do but i made the point that these are [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=833.84s)]
*  springing up everywhere they take cash only they don't cut anyone's hair they've all got a [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=838.48s)]
*  lamborghini parked out the back well i'm pleased to say the national crime agency has now raided [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=843.52s)]
*  300 of these over the course of the last month and perhaps they should follow my social media a [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=848.56s)]
*  little bit more think about this the home secretary has promised that she will by the end of the year [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=854.24s)]
*  start to publish the crime statistics and i hope that she does i hope she lives up to her word [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=862.3199999999999s)]
*  because when this has happened in the rest of europe it has led to very [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=868.4799999999999s)]
*  dramatic political changes with the rise of passes many of whom we would not ourselves [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=872.7199999999999s)]

*  a couple of decades ago and 64 percent of that number have been convicted of crime it is stats [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=890.9599999999999s)]
*  like that that are fundamentally changing politics across europe and in a way that can [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=897.12s)]
*  often be i think pretty unhelpful and further widen division and that division we've seen here too [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=903.28s)]
*  i'm afraid we've seen and i predicted this some years ago the growth of sectarian politics you [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=911.28s)]
*  know the four people sit behind me in the chamber along with mr corbyn but the four are gaza [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=917.44s)]
*  independents their vote is purely on religious lines now i've never seen sectarian politics in [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=923.76s)]
*  my lifetime in england but i have seen it in northern ireland and all the baleful consequences [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  that that led to i have a feeling that this is an issue that will really start to hurt [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=938.64s)]
*  the labor party by the time the next general election comes along where the gaza independence [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=945.36s)]
*  will win many many more seats let alone south asian gangs fighting on the streets of lester [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=949.6s)]
*  or the fact that one million people who are living here permanently speak little or no english [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=957.0400000000001s)]

*  because it was here in 2020 just as the pandemic was kicking in and lockdown was starting that i [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=971.28s)]
*  began to go out from this port to film the migrant boats crossing it was a story that you know i mean [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  sort of radio kent would cover it it was a local story but a story that nationally wasn't being [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=989.04s)]
*  told and it was very clear to me in 2020 and i said that frankly you might as well put up a sign [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=994.24s)]
*  on the white cliffs of dover everyone welcome and i predicted there would be an invasion it's a word [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1000.88s)]
*  that got me in very big trouble but have a look at the numbers that have come as for this government [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1007.28s)]
*  promising it was smashed the gangs i never believed a word of it there's as much chance of that working [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1013.52s)]
*  on our current course as there is of smashing the drug gangs something we've heard from governments [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1019.04s)]
*  for decade after decade yet class a proliferates on every street in the country today labor are [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1025.04s)]
*  doing very very badly indeed in fact year on year the numbers crossing the channel are 40% up already [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  and that's before we get the warmer water and the longer clear settle spells of weather this is [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1041.12s)]
*  a national security emergency and one of the trends that we've noticed in the last few weeks [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1048.6399999999999s)]
*  are now a number of young palestinians coming in from gaza and of course they claim asylum [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1054.72s)]
*  they'll be granted asylum but frankly letting people in from war zones young males of fighting [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1062.4s)]
*  age from war zones when you don't know what their involvement in those areas might have been is an [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1068.72s)]
*  incredibly dangerous thing to do and i am the only party leader that has been trusted on legal [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1074.96s)]
*  immigration i've been arguing it since 2004 and on illegal immigration i've been arguing it since [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1081.28s)]
*  2020 these local elections on may the first this issue will have a huge impact i will give you but [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1087.12s)]
*  one example this morning which is a northern constituency called roncorne and hellsby there [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1093.52s)]
*  are 750 young men living in that constituency who have crossed the english channel 750 of them [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1101.52s)]
*  just in one constituency and the big debate and the big press coverage is all about the hotels [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1109.28s)]
*  something else that i exposed back in 2020 but the hotels frankly are the least of the problem [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1115.44s)]
*  it's the hmos that are increasingly becoming the issue the houses of multiple occupancy and as we've [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1120.64s)]
*  been out and campaigned in that constituency yes that house there there are 10 men living in that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1128.4s)]
*  house there are 15 men living in the house around the corner they loiter all day on the streets they [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1133.84s)]
*  follow our kids to school we're scared to go out in the evening these are the impacts these are the [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1140.48s)]
*  impacts on the lives of a huge number of people in this country and yet westminster just wants to [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1146.6399999999999s)]
*  cock a deafen it doesn't really want to engage with any of these things the cost just in that [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1153.4399999999998s)]
*  constituency alone to local government is 85 000 pounds a day and it's the same here in kent and [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1159.2s)]
*  it's the same everywhere the total cost for housing these people is not all met by national [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1165.68s)]
*  government through taxation 20 to 25 percent of it has to be met by local authorities well you [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1170.88s)]
*  might say it's all well and good moaning and complaining about the failures of the two so-called [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1178.4s)]
*  not for long political parties what i've tried to do there is to lay out some statistics over [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1183.92s)]
*  a broad range of issues to show you the extent to which this population explosion has damaged [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1190.08s)]
*  the quality of i haven't even mentioned the roads has damaged the quality of life for so many people [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1196.24s)]
*  so what do we as the most trusted party in this area what do we intend to do about it well frankly [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1201.92s)]
*  the whole thing is pretty fruitless unless we leave the european court of human rights [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1209.6s)]
*  and repeal the 1998 human rights act every single week we see people criminals people who behave [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1216.08s)]
*  terribly who ought to be deported but they're not because they claim the right to a family life [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1224.8799999999999s)]
*  under article 8 of the echr something that our own judiciary leans on i recommit today we must have [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1231.52s)]
*  no more population increase due to net migration that is something we may have to revisit as the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1239.2s)]
*  numbers that are leaving britain is going up pretty alarmingly as is seen of course in the tax receipts [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1246.64s)]
*  rachel reaves's figures in the last few days we are committed to ending two-tier policing [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1254.0s)]
*  and two-tier justice and frankly that becomes ever clearer and clearer particularly since south [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1261.6s)]
*  port and it's something that is enraging the silent majority in this country and we will end [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1269.04s)]
*  all d e i recruitment in the public sector the fact that 43 police forces now discriminate against [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1276.8s)]
*  white people in favor of ethnic minorities for jobs could only divide our country yet [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1286.72s)]
*  further it's a mistake we as a political party are colorblind we couldn't care less what color [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1292.24s)]
*  you are we couldn't care less where you come from we couldn't care less what your religion is [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1298.16s)]

*  you integrate with us of course you can have your own private observance but that is what we [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1309.68s)]
*  demand of people and we have to have a meritocratic society that is the only way [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1315.68s)]
*  it's the only way our private companies or our public sector can achieve their best and we will [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1321.04s)]
*  we will of course reiterate the fact that as an island we have advantages and we need strong [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1329.04s)]
*  borders but enough of home secretary after home secretary making promises and dodging issues [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1335.04s)]
*  this labor government claim they've increased deportations but all they've done [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1342.88s)]
*  is to send away visa overstayers and those who are happy to voluntarily return often with three [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1346.88s)]
*  thousand pounds in their pocket we will appoint we will demand this government does the same [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1354.48s)]
*  that there is a minister for deportations it will be part of the home office but it'll be a separate [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1360.32s)]
*  department within it we will need to recruit new people as much of the evidence is that those [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1367.6s)]
*  currently work in the home office would willfully obstruct policy if we won the next general election [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1374.0s)]
*  but somebody somewhere in government needs to be held accountable and you know you've only got to [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1380.7199999999998s)]
*  go back 20 years to a last labor government and they were deporting tens of thousands of people [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1386.08s)]
*  a year who were here illegally when Blunkett was home secretary if you came illegally you know you [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1391.52s)]
*  didn't touch the sides you were sent back so what i'm calling for isn't actually anything [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1397.2s)]
*  particularly radical it's actually just common sense it's what most countries in the world do [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1402.64s)]
*  you want to go and live there you want to go and settle there you have to meet a set of criteria [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1408.96s)]
*  and that country chooses are you the right person or are you not i know the problem is is huge [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  because there are an estimated 1.2 million people here illegally and going beyond the [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1423.52s)]
*  last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job give me one hell of a battle [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1431.76s)]
*  and we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us at every point but it is our [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=1437.28s)]

*  millions on climate change it's not the job of county councils to spend huge amounts of money [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2343.12s)]

*  refuse to have migrant hotels or hmos imposed upon them they could be damn difficult and and actually [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2395.44s)]
*  what you've seen in parliament over the last five years you know individual cases i mean pretty [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2401.76s)]
*  patel's constituency you know migrant hotel was put in pretty's constituency i turned up with an [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2406.8s)]
*  iphone filmed it all and the next day the hotel was closed down and moved to a different constituency [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2412.0s)]
*  so you do get mps who are able already you know if they're in a position of power to perhaps ease [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2416.72s)]
*  things for their constituents that's what we could do but now you know there there is an enormous [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2421.84s)]
*  burden from all of this but what but what a kent county council can do you know is as i say find [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2426.48s)]

*  what the basic job of a county council is i think they've extended way beyond that remit okay moving [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2443.36s)]
*  on william john russell from reuters another writers fine okay um amin shimaz from the guardian [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2450.72s)]
*  um [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2460.32s)]

*  the east sussex west sussex hampshire isle of white i'm running out now it's probably [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2486.0s)]
*  another one there somewhere i mean the fact that five and a half million oh sorry sorry the fact [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2491.52s)]
*  that five and a half million people have been denied their vote in what was some of our very [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2495.36s)]
*  strongest counties uh we're very very angry about and there's no argument for it you know angela [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2500.0800000000004s)]
*  reyna's so-called devolution of local government applies equally to ken as it does to essex and [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2505.84s)]
*  yet this side of the estuary of voting and that side are not so i said at the start of the campaign [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2511.28s)]
*  my aim my goal my ambition was to win 200 county council or unitary equivalent seats that was my [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2516.48s)]
*  aim the other aim of course has been to take on labor in roncorne and hellsby which is i understand [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  their 16th safest seat in britain and to run them close that was another aim that i set for me at [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2530.0800000000004s)]
*  let me tell you we are running them close in roncorne and hellsby in fact i don't know we [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2536.48s)]
*  might even be doing a touch better than that there's still a week to go if hayward is right [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2541.52s)]
*  if we win that number of seats uh then that will be quite a political revolution [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2546.48s)]
*  we will have to see not long to wait now um emma core from global [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2551.68s)]
*  what do you make the route what they're doing [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2558.64s)]
*  yeah i think the conservative candidate in cambridge is not living within the constituency [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2560.4s)]
*  either so i think this is not something that's uncommon um andrea has got accommodation in [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2573.6800000000003s)]
*  lincoln uh she's born and bred in lincolnshire she was a county councillor for boston her [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2578.08s)]
*  grandfather was a fisherman in grimsby her links with lincolnshire are pretty clear and strong [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2583.52s)]
*  she did win a surprise election in leads you know when she when when she beat the um the dancing [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2589.12s)]
*  star and star of tv uh breakfast tv now um ed so unsurprisingly she got a property in that constituency [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2596.64s)]
*  and the one factor here that is difficult is that there is a seven-year-old boy who has quite severe [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2605.68s)]
*  educational learning difficulties and she said look if she's elected as mayor of greater [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2615.84s)]
*  lincolnshire she will find the right school for him near lincoln that's not something you can do [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2620.4s)]
*  literally overnight so you know she's living between the two that is a fact uh the fact this [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2626.8s)]
*  vexay really quite vexatious complaints been put in let me tell you this if they say that andrea [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2633.12s)]
*  has broken the rules on friday tomorrow at this hearing do you know what it'll mean it'll mean [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2638.4s)]
*  the entire mayoral election is rerun it won't mean just that she's disqualified the whole thing [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2644.48s)]
*  will have to be rerun and i don't think the voters of lincolnshire would like that very much so i [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2651.44s)]
*  expect tomorrow we get a common sense judgment that is based around the fact her situation and [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2656.56s)]
*  she's a single mom now her situation with a seven-year-old boy with bad learning difficulties [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2662.88s)]
*  explains to some extent why she is where she is all right we will find out tomorrow morning [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2668.72s)]
*  who was we uh we got noah hoffman from the sun hello um nigel how would you intro you [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2674.96s)]

*  highest skill comes to the uk to stop this um concerning trend of sectarian politics that we [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2688.48s)]
*  see in the comments and just generally um in sort of local areas how would you ensure that any new [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2694.72s)]
*  migrants have british values and are very determined to integrate where some have not [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2701.68s)]
*  well i think one of the big cons with this and one of the reasons that major problems have built [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2708.0s)]
*  up in in some of our inner cities and northern towns in particular is because of this family [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2711.6s)]
*  reunion policy but you know somebody comes in as a low-skill worker let's say for argument's sake [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2717.9199999999996s)]
*  uh might work for a bit might then be on benefits is then allowed to bring extended family from [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2723.92s)]
*  wherever it may be they come in uh they don't learn the language they fail at school they become [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2728.56s)]
*  part of that welfareism system and i think it's within that environment it's within that [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2735.92s)]
*  environment uh that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive so i think we have to be much [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2741.04s)]
*  much more rigorous about family reunion which of course makes up such a large number of those that [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2747.04s)]
*  have come to britain and you know some will say that's tough that's unfair but look what the result [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2752.32s)]
*  of it has been it certainly hasn't been a positive one um okay we've got uh camilla from the daily [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2756.4s)]

*  um you mentioned about the rising uh settings and straighter kind of development services [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2781.52s)]
*  and locally there's an issue that impacts parents in this country there in this county [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2785.92s)]
*  the parents across the country i mean just what needs to be done to make sure that parents are [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2790.0s)]
*  supported and that just ease the burden that currently in fear yeah it's a massive problem [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2794.4s)]
*  i i have to say for my own money um when you get to 18 um and you put somebody on a disability [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2799.2799999999997s)]
*  uh register unemployed uh with a high level of benefits uh you're telling people aged 18 that [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2809.2s)]
*  they're that they're victims and if you are told you're a victim and you think you're a victim [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2816.56s)]
*  you are very likely to stay as a victim and so many of these diagnoses you know for send [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2824.08s)]
*  for send before 18 for disability register after 18 so many of these have been conducted [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2831.92s)]
*  on zoom with the family gp right i think that is a massive mistake i think if you're you know if [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2841.84s)]
*  i'm your family gp and i've known your family for generations and you're saying to me doc there's [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2852.48s)]
*  a real problem here with depression or whatever it may be it's quite hard for me as your gp to say no [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2858.32s)]
*  so i don't think any i don't think any of these allocations should be done by family gps and that [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2866.0800000000004s)]
*  should be done independently and i think we are massively i'm not being heartless here i'm being [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2872.1600000000003s)]
*  frank i think we are massively over diagnosing those with mental illness problems those with [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2879.36s)]
*  other uh general behavioral disabilities um and i think we're creating a class of victims in britain [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2887.36s)]
*  who will struggle ever to get out of it and that's not good for them and it's not good for us so i [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2894.56s)]
*  worry about those things i do accept though i do accept that repeated lockdowns particularly the [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2899.6s)]
*  third lockdown were probably the biggest mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2906.56s)]
*  and they have caused great long-term harm okay and lastly here before i do some one-to-ones with [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2913.84s)]
*  um broadcast emma core from lbc okay we are sorry i apologize we are done and dusted sorry [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2919.52s)]

*  how it's failed i wanted to ask do you think multiculturalism is dead now in this country [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2939.92s)]
*  and if so why no sadly i think multiculturalism is alive and well that's why we got the growth of [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2946.0s)]
*  sectarian politics and that's why we got people you know marching on the streets of london it's [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2951.44s)]
*  why we had the provocation against the jewish community that took place in south end last [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2957.28s)]
*  weekend i mean had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2963.68s)]
*  you know the long arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very very quickly [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2970.16s)]
*  i think what has changed is the national narrative the national narrative that multiculturalism is [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2976.72s)]
*  good the encouragement by a labor party in particular you know please let's put you all [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2983.9199999999996s)]
*  in separate little boxes let's have identity politics on a massive scale i think that and [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=2990.08s)]

*  stand for and i i think what you're going to see on may the first is a lot of conservative voters [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3185.44s)]

*  goes back to you know the earlier questions um that i was asked by the press association [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3223.68s)]
*  about you know do i want to do deals etc and no our aim is to replace the conservative party as [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3229.12s)]
*  the party of opposition to this labor government and that is what we're going to try and do all [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3235.44s)]
*  right thank you very much everybody good morning everybody how fortunate i've been or perhaps it [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3239.92s)]
*  was just good judgment in picking zeah as party chairman because the big thing we had to do [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3247.2s)]
*  after the last general election was to professionalize the party and we've done that [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3253.2s)]
*  and i'm very proud of the fact we've managed to put more candidates in the field for may the first [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3257.7599999999998s)]
*  than any other party but today i wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3262.0s)]
*  issue and one that perhaps doesn't impact on the may the first elections but you would be wrong [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3268.08s)]
*  indeed the population explosion that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3275.44s)]
*  lives of more people than any other single issue and it's interesting because up until 1997 this [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3281.28s)]
*  wasn't even a political debate indeed when i was first elected to the european parliament in 1999 [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3290.16s)]
*  immigration didn't appear in my election literature or a manifesto at all and that's [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3297.12s)]
*  because simply from winrush right up until mr blair became prime minister net migration into [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3303.28s)]
*  britain had run at an average of 30 to 50 000 people a year sometimes higher sometimes lower [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3309.36s)]
*  it wasn't even a debate in successive general elections but the labor party under blair decided [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3317.52s)]
*  that diversity was a good thing something that was never ever to be questioned and that mass [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3324.88s)]
*  immigration would be good for the economy would make us all better off and frankly anybody that [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3332.16s)]
*  dared to even question this up until at least 2010 was considered completely and utterly beyond the [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3338.72s)]
*  pale the worst of the worst and i know this because i first started speaking out about open borders in [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3347.12s)]
*  2004 when it became pretty obvious to me that opening up the door to eight and then ten former [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3353.6s)]
*  communist countries some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size of ours would [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3361.76s)]
*  lead to a huge inflow of people although at least in those days people that came did actually work [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3367.44s)]
*  that sadly has now all changed and since then in every single general election we've been made a [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3373.84s)]
*  series of promises that frankly amount to little more than a pack of lies the public being told [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3382.5600000000004s)]
*  what the parties think the public want to hear in fact know from polling what the public want to [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3390.4s)]
*  hear without any intention of delivering on it at all of course the conservatives far worse than [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3396.64s)]
*  tony blair net migration to tens of thousands promised in 2010 2015 2017 and then 2019 we were [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3402.7200000000003s)]
*  told substantially lower numbers we now have a labor government who've promised they will [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3411.2000000000003s)]
*  radically bring down the numbers coming into britain and we'll find out in june [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3417.52s)]
*  when we get the first ons data whether that's true although i very much doubt it we've been told by [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3421.28s)]
*  successive prime ministers they would stop the boats even that they would smash the gangs well [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3427.52s)]
*  i'm afraid none of it has come true and i think it's about time we looked at the true cost of the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3434.1600000000003s)]
*  population explosion to this country and i want to make this point very clear that recent polling [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3441.52s)]
*  particularly polling that was published last week in the sun newspaper which was the whole of the [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3447.68s)]
*  midlands of the north showed that we are now by far the most trusted party on this issue and that [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3453.52s)]
*  i am by far the most trusted leader to do something about it it'll be good for the economy is what we [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3460.64s)]
*  were told well 30 years ago seven percent of the workforce were foreign-born today 21 percent of [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3468.4s)]
*  the workforce are foreign-born that has directly led to a pay cut on average of about three percent [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3474.08s)]
*  per worker which of course doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money but if you're [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3481.76s)]
*  earning 20 000 pounds a year it does mean quite a lot and interestingly the bank of england in 2015 [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3486.0s)]
*  produced a report showing a direct link between numbers of foreign-born workers and wage suppression [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3492.16s)]
*  yet the whole thing was completely and utterly covered up the impact of course on wages is [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3499.44s)]
*  worse than that given that there are 500 000 700 000 who knows people working in the illegal economy [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3505.3599999999997s)]
*  leading to further wage suppression the greatest myth of course is that it will be good for us and [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3513.92s)]
*  you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here has come to work well try this [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3521.36s)]
*  statistic for size foreign-born workers are 40 percent higher likely to be unemployed than [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3526.0s)]
*  british-born workers 40 percent higher for foreign-born people to be on the unemployment register [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3535.44s)]
*  it's not a statistic i'd ever heard before it's pretty mind-blowing and even the argument that [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3543.1200000000003s)]
*  look most people come here to work so what is there to complain about well i'm afraid that [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3550.08s)]
*  doesn't work either because in the last six years net three million people have settled in britain [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3554.48s)]
*  from outside of europe and of those only 16 came on work visas it's completely mind-blowing number [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3561.76s)]
*  now it's true to say that many of those who've come perhaps will enter the workforce but you [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3570.48s)]
*  begin to understand that the argument for mass migration that is needed for the labor market [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3575.84s)]
*  actually isn't true where the majority that come come as dependents the center for migration studies [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3581.28s)]
*  recently published that since 2020 unemployment benefits to foreign-born people have been 36 [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3588.32s)]
*  billion pounds we are talking simply about eye watering numbers the other statistic that i [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3595.6000000000004s)]
*  was surprised by was that low-paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer 150 000 pounds by the [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3603.44s)]
*  time they reach retirement let alone what that will be afterwards so let us be clear non-selective [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3610.4s)]
*  in many case non-working mass migration into britain has made everybody in this country [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3618.8s)]
*  poorer except of course for big employers who love much cheap migrant foreign labor as they can [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3625.68s)]
*  possibly get their hands on as the argument grows every year that british people simply won't do [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3632.88s)]
*  those jobs but we're told it's okay because we're growing we're getting richer gross domestic [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3640.2400000000002s)]
*  product is going up and that's the only measure that anybody on the two front benches in parliament [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3648.56s)]
*  will ever talk about i did try the other day with rachel reeves and she's trying too but i did try [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3654.8s)]
*  to make the argument that actually gdp in gross figures doesn't mean very much when you have a [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3662.88s)]
*  population that's rising by three quarters of a million or a million every year directly as a [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3669.2000000000003s)]
*  result of open borders why not look at gdp per capita but no nobody wants to engage with that [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3674.7200000000003s)]
*  well the last two years have seen record levels of migration into britain and gdp per capita has [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3681.52s)]
*  fallen in six of the last eight quarters we are getting poorer as a result of policies started by [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3688.08s)]
*  the labor party accelerated by the conservative party and now being continued by labor none of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3696.56s)]
*  which of course means that we in this country don't want high-skilled law-abiding people to come into [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3703.36s)]
*  britain to work pay taxes add to our society all of those things are good but we have to [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3710.4s)]
*  we have to discriminate yes that's that's the word i'm going to use it means choose [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3718.08s)]
*  we have to discriminate in terms of who comes into our country and in what numbers [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3722.2400000000002s)]
*  to try and have a rational debate about housing is virtually impossible i've been trying for over 10 [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3730.0s)]
*  years to engage other party leaders in a rational debate about the terrible housing shortage the [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3735.44s)]
*  cost of housing and rents in this country nobody will engage with me of the house price rises that [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3741.2000000000003s)]
*  we've had over the last two decades 25 of that is directly down to immigration and the rising [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3749.2000000000003s)]
*  population indeed even the ministry of housing themselves said in 2018 again suppressed not [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3757.44s)]
*  publicized that a one percent increase in the number of households leads to a two percent [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3765.84s)]

*  power there are now 28.5 million households net migration has increased the population by 10 [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=3778.24s)]

*  separate department within it we will need to recruit new people as much of the evidence is [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4625.76s)]

*  actually anything particularly radical it's actually just common sense it's what most countries in the [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4660.240000000001s)]
*  world do you want to go and live there you want to go and settle there you have to meet a set of [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4666.08s)]
*  criteria and that country chooses are you the right person or are you not [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4672.4s)]

*  and going beyond the last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job it's [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4688.879999999999s)]
*  going to be one hell of a battle and we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4694.4s)]
*  at every point but it is our intention ultimately that if you've come illegally [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4699.52s)]
*  you should not be able to stay you should not be able to make a spurious claim [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4703.92s)]
*  that somehow your right to a family life means you should stay here we will in three to four weeks [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4708.64s)]
*  time announce more detailed policy on how we will actually carry out those deportations we'll do that [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4715.92s)]
*  after the election but i make the intention very very clear here today we will bring a total end [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4724.0s)]
*  a total end to all asylum claims from people who've come here on travel visas or who are [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4731.84s)]
*  overseas students we will demand the deportation of all foreign criminals and for those who come [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4739.52s)]
*  to britain and who are granted citizenship that will be regarded as a legally binding contract [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4748.0s)]
*  just as it is in australia and elsewhere we welcome you in if you make those pledges to us [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4754.4s)]
*  but you actually have to obey the law and and be somebody who was a positive benefit to our country [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4761.12s)]
*  we are a party who are very proud of the fact we had more votes in the general election from the [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4767.84s)]
*  ethnic minority vote than the liberal democrats did and an increasing number of people from all [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4774.88s)]
*  communities want to stand for our party these are people who came to britain or their parents came [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4779.92s)]
*  to britain because they wanted to be part of this great country they wanted to become a success in [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4786.24s)]
*  this great country so try as anyone might to twist anything i've said today all i've given you are [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4791.92s)]
*  hard facts all i've laid out are sensible policies that will stop illegal immigration [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4798.64s)]
*  into britain and stop the population explosion which is damaging the quality of life for so many [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4803.6s)]
*  countless millions thank you very much indeed now we have quite a big press list [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4810.0s)]
*  and i will go through it in order beginning with stanley murphy johns from the press association [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4817.200000000001s)]
*  um [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4824.72s)]
*  there's no [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4828.8s)]
*  uh between you and the conservatives what no no for us and the party of mass immigration did you say [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4830.8s)]
*  so i missed you um but there are calls to unite the right so what could that look like [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4837.04s)]
*  good old robert the remainer good old robert the man who's been on the davocene road to damas [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4847.6s)]
*  i mean the debasing conversion on the roads of damascus um [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4853.44s)]
*  you will see on may the second that our biggest gains are going to be in labor voting areas [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4859.44s)]
*  that is where we are making most impact i would also tell you that the majority of our members [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4869.04s)]
*  and a big percentage of our voters at the last election were not voting conservative [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4876.96s)]
*  because they loathed the conservative party they could not put up with the level of betrayal [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4882.96s)]
*  that had happened since the 2019 80 seat majority if we were to even contemplate [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4888.8s)]
*  doing a deal i mean our votes our voters would be revolted by it our party itself internally [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4897.04s)]
*  would be in revolt and if i wanted to do a deal with you of any kind i would shake your hand [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4905.12s)]
*  look you in the eye and do that deal because i trusted you i don't trust the conservative [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4912.08s)]
*  party in any way at all and we are going to replace them thank you next one kitty donelson [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4916.64s)]
*  from the eye paper um [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4922.72s)]
*  so we want to re-industrialize britain you know i worked for 22 years in the metals industry my [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4935.92s)]
*  clients work rolling mills my clients produce lead sheet my clients manufactured copper wire [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4946.96s)]
*  you know these are the people i dealt with on a daily basis working in the metals industry [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4953.599999999999s)]
*  in the city of of of london and i've seen nearly all of them go disappear since 1990 [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4957.28s)]
*  and we boast about the fact we've reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50 was no wonder is it we [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4964.64s)]
*  just exported co2 emissions elsewhere and given ourselves most expensive energy in the world to [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4970.72s)]
*  re-industrialize we have to have a sensible grown-up relationship with the trade union movement [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4975.84s)]
*  because they're going to be a big part of us re-industrializing britain this is not some [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4980.72s)]
*  dramatic u-turn by me or anything like this it's a practical way of looking at how we do this as [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4984.96s)]
*  far as birmingham's concerned i sense that birmingham is just the beginning of what is [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4990.72s)]
*  going to be a very very difficult summer and autumn for the labor government with the trade [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=4996.64s)]
*  union movement they of course virtually own the labor party when you think that you know unite [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5001.04s)]
*  have given them 28 million since 2020 the gmb have given them 20 million since 2020 sorry other way [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5005.76s)]
*  around 28 20 other way around um so they've really funded the labor party uh and they see weakness [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5011.2s)]
*  from the labor party and that i think is why we're going to see increasing disputes clearly clearly [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5017.2s)]
*  as far as birmingham is concerned there is a national health hazard i understand some of the [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5023.36s)]
*  backlog is being cleared up i think the army was sent in weren't they the army was sent in to help [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5028.64s)]
*  with logistics well perhaps they should have been sent in to clear up the rubbish a little bit earlier [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5034.24s)]
*  i think was fought on both sides with that thank you um katey harris from the express [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5038.8s)]
*  i can tell you that since brexit and i speak as the only member of parliament that has a has a [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5043.76s)]
*  vested financial interest in a commercial fishing boat which i do i can tell you that since brexit [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5060.320000000001s)]
*  there are more foreign boats fishing out here on the six mile line that we've ever seen at any point [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5068.08s)]
*  in previous history and that goes right the way down to land's end the environmental damage to [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5076.08s)]
*  fish stocks in this eastern channel since brexit has been horrendous the regulations put by the [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5082.4s)]
*  mmo and the mca on our own fishing industry are so onerous and so expensive uh that frankly many [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5089.04s)]
*  of them think the situation is worse now than it was before we left the european union and any [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5096.88s)]
*  further surrender of our fishing rights will literally finish off what was once a big industry [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5103.28s)]
*  and it's total and utter madness the minimum brexit should have given us is the 12 mile line [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5108.88s)]
*  the maximum of course would have been a 200 mile exclusive economic zone as enjoyed by norway the [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5115.04s)]
*  faroe islands iceland and any normal country in the world and i worry about that i worry about [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5121.12s)]
*  alignment with um veterinary standards and food standards with the european union i worry about [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5128.48s)]
*  alignment for carbon taxes for example with the european union and i worry perhaps even more [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5135.36s)]
*  that on the 19th of march we're going to be talking about a form of military alignment [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5142.16s)]
*  which will include intelligence sharing to potentially a very high level that i think [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5148.64s)]
*  could fundamentally damage our relationship with nato and america i worry that this prime minister [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5153.76s)]
*  who after all is a remainer it's a remit in fact it's it is a remainer labor party in a huge way [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5159.52s)]
*  i worry that he's going to take us so closely back towards alignment with the european union [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5165.92s)]
*  and maybe even free movement of people for those under 30 um i worry about those things [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5170.4s)]
*  because i believe that it damages our ability to do business with the rest of the world and the [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5176.56s)]
*  bright economic future is not the eurozone believe you me elizabeth piper from Reuters [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5181.04s)]

*  yours is a jolly [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5191.28s)]
*  professionalization of the party you just said that even your opening remarks that has now been [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5196.08s)]
*  done yeah so you're saying that process is now complete or is there more to do [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5200.96s)]
*  and how would you answer those members who fear that that process is actually taking the party [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5205.28s)]
*  away from his heart and soul well look i mean hundreds of people who applied to be candidates [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5210.0s)]
*  for the county council elections were rejected rejected uh often because of repeated use [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5221.2s)]
*  of words beginning with f and c on social media and you know that might be the way you talk to [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5231.68s)]
*  your mates in the pub but frankly you're chucking it out on facebook or x it really is something [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5238.08s)]
*  that's going to come back come back and bite you others because they just said things that were [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5243.04s)]
*  just ridiculous outrageous embarrassing um so professionalizing the party had to be putting in [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5246.88s)]
*  you know a vetting system that was as good if not better than the other parties and yes that has [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5253.44s)]
*  upset some people uh in terms of professionalization we've only just started and i mean the liberal [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5259.76s)]
*  democrats won 72 seats i mean liberal democrats will increase their vote on may the first and [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5266.64s)]
*  much of it at the expense of the conservative party i can tell you because they're going to lose [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5273.52s)]
*  votes both ways on may the first but they've got a phenomenal thriving branch structure [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5276.96s)]
*  and so much of successful politics is about the social element of politics whether it was in the [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5283.12s)]
*  part of the world you come from the working man's club up north where you know the labor party was [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5289.04s)]
*  very strong or whether it's you know the the the more genteel garden party of the conservative [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5293.2s)]
*  local conservative association in the south of england and we've not yet been able to build [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5299.92s)]
*  those social interactions between people um and that is something else we have to do we have to [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5306.48s)]
*  train them how to raise money etc all i would say to you is i think in the last 10 months we've made [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5311.28s)]

*  but i would say to you we've made enormous enormous strides forward and one of the reasons we need to [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5329.76s)]
*  win a really good number of council seats is you know we can build teams of people around elected [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5335.68s)]
*  councillors i also said i would democratize the party i you know i put in place a new constitution [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5342.48s)]

*  we have a look at why so much money is being spent on consultants we have a look at why in [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5574.96s)]
*  some cases up to 10 million pounds a year are being spent on agency workers by county councils [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5581.2s)]
*  across this country we have a look at who the pothole contracts are with and if they were failing [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5587.36s)]
*  providers why they signed up for five years or in one case i know of 10 years so if we had people [[01:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5592.08s)]
*  who agree that it's not the job of county councils to spend millions after millions on climate change [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5597.599999999999s)]
*  it's not the job of county councils to spend huge amounts of money on dei but those areas like [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5603.36s)]
*  consultancies those areas like massive bills for agency workers i mean you know you might need [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5609.6s)]
*  agency workers in a short-term emergency but why you're spending millions year after year [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5616.0s)]
*  as some of them are i don't know so we would work with other people you know if if if we were able [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5620.88s)]
*  to achieve those objectives and that i think is what our voters would want and would demand of [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5626.160000000001s)]
*  us and charlotte wright from the bbc or they will do it face to face later i guess yes [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5633.200000000001s)]
*  and so you're here as part of the local election campaign here in kent what powers would reform [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5638.72s)]
*  county councillors have to do anything differently when it comes to dealing with immigration [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5643.84s)]
*  well they could complain i mean that's one thing they could do they could outright refuse to have [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5649.76s)]
*  migrant hotels or hmos imposed upon them they could be damn difficult and and actually what [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5654.48s)]
*  you've seen in parliament over the last five years you know individual cases i mean pretty [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5660.48s)]
*  patel's constituency you know migrant hotel was put in pretty's constituency i turned up with an [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5665.28s)]
*  iphone filmed it all and the next day the hotel was closed down and moved to a different constituency [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5670.48s)]
*  so you do get mps who are able already you know if they're in a position of power to perhaps ease [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5675.2s)]
*  things for their constituents that's what we could do but now you know there there is an enormous [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5680.32s)]
*  burden from all of this but what but but what a kent county council can do you know is as i say [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5684.96s)]
*  find out who the road contractor deals are with what they're costing why they're so ineffective [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5691.04s)]

*  know we know what the basic job of a county council is i think they've extended way beyond [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5701.52s)]
*  that remit okay moving on william john russell from reuters another writers [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5706.56s)]

*  argument for it you know angela reyna's so-called devolution of local government applies equally to [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5762.64s)]
*  ken as it does to essex and yet this side of the estuary of voting and that side are not so i said [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5768.24s)]
*  at the start of the campaign my aim my goal my ambition was to win 200 county council or unitary [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5773.92s)]
*  equivalent seats that was my aim the other aim of course has been to take on labor in runghorn [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5780.4s)]
*  and hellsby which is i understand their 16th safest seat in britain and to run them close [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5786.719999999999s)]
*  that was another aim that i set for me the first let me tell you we are running them close in [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5792.48s)]
*  runghorn and hellsby in fact i don't know we might even be doing a touch better than that [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5797.92s)]
*  there's still a week to go if hayward is right if we win that number of seats uh then that will be [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5801.68s)]
*  quite a political revolution we will have to see not long to wait now um emma core from global [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5808.08s)]
*  what do you make the ground what they're doing [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5817.2s)]

*  the region as per the rules have you sorted this out yeah i think the conservative candidate in [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5825.44s)]
*  cambridge is not living within the constituency either so i think this is not something that's [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5830.48s)]
*  uncommon um andrea has got accommodation in lincoln uh she's born and bred in lincolnshire [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5833.76s)]

*  you know when she when when um she beat the um the dancing star and star of tv uh breakfast tv now [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5850.639999999999s)]
*  um ed so unsurprisingly she got a property in that constituency and the one factor here that is [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5857.92s)]
*  difficult is that there is a seven-year-old boy who has quite severe educational learning [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5867.6s)]
*  difficulties and she said look if she's elected as mayor of greater lincolnshire she will find [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5875.4400000000005s)]

*  and i don't think the voters of lincolnshire would like that very much so i expect tomorrow [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5911.120000000001s)]
*  we get a common sense judgment that is based around the fact her situation and she's a single [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5916.72s)]
*  mum now her situation with a seven-year-old boy with bad learning difficulties explains to some [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5922.0s)]

*  um we got noah hoffman from the sun hello um nidal how would you enjoy you talking about [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5934.16s)]
*  discriminating and making sure the right choosing choosing right migrants um if they're highly [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5941.2s)]
*  come to the uk to stop this um concerning trend of sectarian politics that we see in the comments [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5947.759999999999s)]
*  and just generally um in sort of local areas how would you ensure that any new migrants have british [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5954.08s)]
*  values and are very determined to integrate where some people well i think one of the big cons with [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5961.92s)]
*  this one of the reasons that major problems have built up in in some of our inner cities and [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5967.759999999999s)]
*  northern towns in particular is because of this family reunion policy where you know somebody comes [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5973.44s)]
*  in as a low-skilled worker let's say for argument's sake might work for a bit might then be on benefits [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5979.36s)]
*  is then allowed to bring extended family from wherever it may be they come in uh they don't [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5985.2s)]
*  learn the language they fail at school they become part of that welfareism system and i think it's [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5990.879999999999s)]
*  that environment it's within that environment uh that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=5997.68s)]
*  so i think we have to be much much more rigorous about family reunion which of course makes up [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6004.080000000001s)]
*  such a large number of those that have come to britain and you know some will say that's tough [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6008.88s)]
*  that's unfair but look what the result of it has been it certainly hasn't been a positive one um [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6013.200000000001s)]

*  quite hard for me as your gp to say no so i don't think any i don't think any of these allocations [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6120.72s)]
*  should be done by family gps and that should be done independently and i think we are massively [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6128.400000000001s)]
*  i'm not being heartless here i'm being frank i think we are massively over diagnosing those [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6136.400000000001s)]
*  with mental illness problems those with other general behavioral disabilities um and i think [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6143.2s)]
*  we're creating a class of victims in britain who will struggle ever to get out of it and that's [[01:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6150.72s)]
*  not good for them and it's not good for us so i worry about those things i do accept though [[01:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6155.679999999999s)]
*  i do accept that repeated lockdowns particularly the third lockdown were probably the biggest [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6161.92s)]
*  mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country and they have caused great long-term [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6167.84s)]
*  harm okay and lastly here before i do some one-to-ones with um broadcast emma core from lbc [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6173.84s)]

*  sorry [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6189.6s)]
*  no sadly i think multiculturalism is alive and well that's what we've got the growth of sectarian [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6206.08s)]
*  politics and that's why we got people you know marching on the streets of london it's why we [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6210.56s)]
*  had the provocation against the jewish community that took place in south end last weekend i mean [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6216.08s)]
*  had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country you know the long [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6223.44s)]
*  arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very very quickly i think what has changed [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6229.28s)]
*  is the national narrative the national narrative that multiculturalism is good the encouragement [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6237.2s)]
*  by a labor party in particular you know please let's put you all in separate little boxes [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6244.32s)]
*  let's have identity politics on a massive scale i think that and i think the realization of what [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6250.4s)]
*  a huge error that was has been exposed probably best by trevor phillips you know who was head of [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6256.48s)]
*  the equalities and human rights commission who recognizes that actually encouraging difference [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6262.96s)]
*  was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness whatever differences [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6269.12s)]
*  our backgrounds may be so that's the direction that we firmly want to go in we need to have a [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6277.2s)]
*  shared culture and and that's the danger of allowing a lot of people into a country with [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6283.36s)]
*  whom you have no shared history with whom you have no shared culture with whom you have little [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6289.68s)]
*  in common and i'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that mattered but now we know it [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6295.28s)]
*  matters and the narrative has changed the reality as yet has not let's hope very soon it does thank [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6301.599999999999s)]
*  you very oh adam i thought i mean i can do it now or face to face yeah so you call for a uk doge [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6310.0s)]
*  cutting the size yeah of the state but now you're also calling for a new minister of deportation [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6317.44s)]
*  you're not making the home office even bigger yes but compared to the cost of seven billion [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6322.32s)]
*  pounds a year of dealing with what's coming over the english channel if we can put a stop to that [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6328.0s)]
*  it'll save a lot of money very very quickly indeed thank you sorry yeah again i was gonna [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6333.28s)]
*  do it face to face on camera but i think richard's eyes rubbed that robert kenrith's just in the [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6339.44s)]
*  role i said he was richard is right you know i mean i reckon at least 50 of the conservative [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6345.76s)]
*  mps ought to be in the liberal democrats i reckon about 21 of the tori mps ought to be in reform [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6352.16s)]
*  um i'm not sure which i'm not sure whether i'm not even sure whether jen rick's one of them maybe he [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6360.240000000001s)]
*  is maybe he's genuine maybe he really has been on this damascene conversion i just don't know and i [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6364.96s)]
*  have to say i thought in the leadership contest he was a bit like a a nijel farage impersonator [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6370.88s)]
*  and um i had a chat with him in the gallery uh in the voting lobby shortly after i said well look [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6375.44s)]
*  mate you know if you want some lessons in getting a personality i mean i'm your man you know i can [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6380.24s)]
*  help you um so i don't know but but i think i mean more seriously i think you know kemmie badenock's [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6384.08s)]
*  problem is twofold number one if she criticizes what's happening in the english channel if she [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6392.24s)]
*  criticizes mass migration if she criticizes high taxation if she criticizes the increasing size of [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6400.08s)]
*  a state if she criticizes uh the hugely increasing debt burden well what did you do for the last 14 [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6406.32s)]
*  years i mean it's the same with the grooming gangs where was she as minister for women [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6412.08s)]
*  two years she was minister for women didn't mention grooming gangs once that i can see [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6419.6s)]
*  so one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past and i think there are many [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6424.24s)]
*  voters you know you can talk red wall but there are parts of kent here that you know when [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6429.76s)]
*  conservative in 2019 that vote's not coming back that's one problem they've got the second problem [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6433.92s)]
*  they've got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for and i i think [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6439.280000000001s)]
*  what you're going to see on may the first is a lot of conservative voters coming to us but equally [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6446.400000000001s)]
*  quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of liberal democrats [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6452.64s)]
*  and that you know and they may have been around for 195 years just as the liberals were the [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6459.76s)]
*  natural party of government until the labor party came along in 1918 and i i i think we are [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6465.4400000000005s)]
*  potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics where an established [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6472.08s)]
*  party that's been a party of government no longer serves any purpose and it goes back to you know [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6477.5199999999995s)]
*  the earlier questions that i was asked by the press association about you know do i want to [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6483.759999999999s)]
*  do deals etc no our aim is to replace the conservative party as the party of opposition [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6488.719999999999s)]
*  to this labor government and that is what we're going to try and do all right thank you very much [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6495.5199999999995s)]
*  everybody good morning everybody how fortunate i've been or perhaps it was just good judgment [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6499.599999999999s)]
*  in picking zeah as party chairman because the big thing we had to do after the last general election [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6507.599999999999s)]
*  was to professionalize the party and we've done that and i'm very proud of the fact we've managed [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6513.12s)]
*  to put more candidates in the field for may the first than any other party but today i wanted to [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6517.919999999999s)]
*  talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue and one that perhaps doesn't [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6523.919999999999s)]
*  impact on the may the first elections but you would be wrong indeed the population explosion [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6528.5599999999995s)]
*  that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the lives of more people than any other [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6536.0s)]
*  single issue and it's interesting because up until 1997 this wasn't even a political debate [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6542.96s)]
*  indeed when i was first elected to the european parliament in 1999 immigration didn't appear [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6551.52s)]
*  in my election literature or a manifesto at all and that's because simply from winrush right up [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6558.08s)]
*  until mr blair became prime minister net migration into britain had run at an average of 30 to 50 [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6564.8s)]
*  thousand people a year sometimes higher sometimes lower it wasn't even a debate in successive [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6571.52s)]
*  general elections but the labor party under blair decided that diversity was a good thing [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6579.4400000000005s)]
*  something that was never ever to be questioned and that mass immigration would be good for the [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6586.08s)]
*  economy would make us all better off and frankly anybody that dared to even question this up until [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6592.08s)]
*  at least 2010 was considered completely and utterly beyond the pale the worst of the worst [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6600.08s)]
*  and i know this because i first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 when it became [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6608.4s)]
*  pretty obvious to me that opening up the door to eight and then 10 former communist countries [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6614.16s)]
*  some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size of ours would lead to a huge inflow [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6621.68s)]
*  of people although at least in those days people that came did actually work that sadly has now [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6627.4400000000005s)]
*  all changed and since then in every single general election we've been made a series of promises [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6634.4800000000005s)]
*  that frankly amount to little more than a pack of lies the public being told what the parties think [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6642.64s)]
*  the public want to hear in fact know from polling what the public want to hear without any intention [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6650.48s)]
*  of delivering on it at all of course the conservatives far worse than tony blair [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6657.839999999999s)]
*  net migration to tens of thousands promised in 2010 2015 2017 and then 2019 we were told [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6662.879999999999s)]
*  substantially lower numbers we now have a labor government who've promised they will radically [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6670.0s)]
*  bring down the numbers coming into britain and we'll find out in june when we get the first [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6676.56s)]
*  ons data whether that's true although i very much doubt it we've been told by successive prime [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6680.72s)]
*  ministers they would stop the boats even that they would smash the gangs well i'm afraid none [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6686.72s)]
*  of it has come true and i think it's about time we looked at the true cost of the population [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6693.4400000000005s)]
*  explosion to this country and i want to make this point very clear that recent polling particularly [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6700.64s)]
*  polling that was published last week in the sun newspaper which was the whole of the midlands of [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6706.64s)]
*  the north showed that we are now by far the most trusted party on this issue and that i am by far [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6712.56s)]
*  the most trusted leader to do something about it it'll be good for the economy is what we were [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6720.56s)]
*  told well 30 years ago seven percent of the workforce were foreign-born today [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6727.2s)]
*  21 percent of the workforce are foreign-born that has directly led to a pay cut on average of about [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6731.599999999999s)]
*  three percent per worker which of course doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6739.68s)]
*  but if you're earning 20 000 pounds a year it does mean quite a lot and interestingly the bank [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6744.24s)]
*  of england in 2015 produced a report showing a direct link between numbers of foreign-born workers [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6749.44s)]
*  and wage suppression yet the whole thing was completely and utterly covered up the impact of [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6756.64s)]
*  course on wages is worse than that given that there are 500 000 700 000 who knows people working [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6763.12s)]
*  in the illegal economy leading to further wage suppression the greatest myth of course is that [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6770.96s)]
*  it will be good for us and you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here has come [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6779.12s)]
*  to work well try this statistic for size foreign-born workers are 40 percent higher likely to be [[01:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6783.04s)]
*  unemployed than british-born workers 40 percent higher for foreign-born people to be on the [[01:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6792.96s)]
*  unemployment register it's not a statistic i'd ever heard before it's pretty mind-blowing and even the [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6800.32s)]
*  argument that look most people come here to work so what is that i complain about what i'm afraid [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6807.2s)]
*  that doesn't work either because in the last six years net three million people have settled in [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6812.88s)]
*  britain from outside of europe and of those only 16 came on work visas it's completely mind-blowing [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6819.76s)]
*  number now it's true to say that many of those who've come perhaps will enter the workforce [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6828.72s)]
*  but you begin to understand that the argument for mass migration that is needed for the labor market [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6834.08s)]
*  actually isn't true where the majority that come come as dependents the center for migration studies [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6839.76s)]
*  recently published that since 2020 unemployment benefits to foreign-born people have been 36 [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6846.88s)]
*  billion pounds we are talking simply about eye watering numbers the other statistic that i [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6854.16s)]
*  was surprised by was that low-paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer 150 000 pounds [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6862.0s)]
*  by the time they reach retirement let alone what that will be afterwards so let us be clear [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6868.56s)]
*  non-selective in many case non-working mass migration into britain has made everybody in [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6875.360000000001s)]
*  this country poorer except of course for big employers who love as much cheap migrant foreign [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=6883.4400000000005s)]

*  are increasingly becoming the issue the houses of multiple occupancy and as we've been out and [[02:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7639.36s)]

*  separate department within it we will need to recruit new people as much of the evidence is [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7884.24s)]
*  that those that currently work in the home office would willfully obstruct policy if we won the next [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7890.4800000000005s)]
*  general election but somebody somewhere in government needs to be held accountable and you [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7896.72s)]
*  know you've only got to go back 20 years to a last labor government and they were deporting [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7902.16s)]

*  actually anything particularly radical it's actually just common sense it's what most countries [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7918.72s)]
*  in the world do you want to go and live there you want to go and settle there you have to meet a set [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7924.32s)]
*  of criteria and that country chooses are you the right person or are you not [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7930.4s)]
*  i know the problem is is huge because there are an estimated 1.2 million people here illegally [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7938.08s)]
*  and going beyond the last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job it's [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7947.36s)]
*  going to be one hell of a battle and we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7952.96s)]
*  at every point but it is our intention ultimately that if you've come illegally [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7958.08s)]
*  you should not be able to stay you should not be able to make a spurious claim [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7962.4s)]
*  that somehow your right to a family life means you should stay here we will in three to four weeks [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7967.2s)]
*  time announce more detailed policy on how we will actually carry out those deportations we'll do that [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7974.48s)]
*  after the election but i make the intention very very clear here today we will bring a total end [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7982.56s)]
*  a total end to all asylum claims from people who've come here on travel visas or who are [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=7990.400000000001s)]

*  said at the start of the campaign my aim my goal my ambition was to win 200 county council or [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9032.24s)]
*  unitary equivalent seats that was my aim the other aim of course has been to take on labor [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9038.48s)]
*  in ron corn and hellsby which is i understand their 16th safest seat in britain and to run them close [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9044.56s)]
*  that was another aim that i set for me the first let me tell you we are running them close in [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9050.96s)]
*  ron corn and hellsby in fact i don't know we might even be doing a touch better than that [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9056.48s)]
*  there's still a week to go if hayward is right if we win that number of seats uh then that will be [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9060.24s)]

*  cambridge is not living within the constituency either so i think this is not something that's [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9089.04s)]
*  uncommon um andrea has got accommodation in lincoln uh she's born and bred in lincolnshire [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9092.32s)]

*  difficult is that there is a seven-year-old boy who has quite severe educational learning [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9126.16s)]
*  difficulties and she said look if she's elected as mayor of greater lincolnshire she will find [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9134.0s)]

*  determined to integrate where some have not well i think one of the big cons with this and one of [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9222.4s)]
*  the reasons that major problems have built up in in some of our inner cities and northern towns in [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9226.72s)]
*  particular is because of this family reunion policy where you know somebody comes in as a [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9232.88s)]
*  low-skilled worker let's say for argument's sake might work for a bit might then be on benefits is [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9238.24s)]
*  then allowed to bring extended family from wherever it may be they come in they don't learn the [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9243.84s)]
*  language they fail at school they become part of that welfare ism system and i think it's within [[02:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9249.76s)]
*  that environment it's within that environment uh that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9256.24s)]
*  so that we have to be much much more rigorous about family reunion which of course makes up such a [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9262.64s)]
*  large number of those that have come to britain and you know some will say that's tough that's [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9267.76s)]
*  unfair but look what the result of it has been it certainly hasn't been a positive one um okay [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9272.0s)]
*  we've got uh camilla from the daily express that's the end of the video you're doing the video right [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9278.880000000001s)]
*  whoever gave me this list is in for um a bit of a talking to you um okay who else we got we've got [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9287.28s)]
*  joshua from bauer media group [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9296.0s)]
*  yeah it's a massive problem i i have to say for my own money um when you get to 18 [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9315.12s)]
*  um and you put somebody on a disability register unemployed uh with a high level of benefits [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9322.24s)]
*  you're telling people aged 18 that they're that they're victims and if you are told you're a [[02:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9332.880000000001s)]
*  victim and you think you're a victim you are very likely to stay as a victim and so many of these [[02:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9338.880000000001s)]
*  diagnoses you know for send before 18 for disability register after 18 so many of these [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9347.12s)]
*  have been conducted on zoom with the family gp right i think that is a massive mistake [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9356.560000000001s)]
*  i think if you're you know if i'm your family gp and i've known your family for generations [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9367.76s)]
*  and you're saying to me doc there's a real problem here with depression or whatever it may be it's [[02:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9374.16s)]
*  quite hard for me as your gp to say no so i don't think any i don't think any of these allocations [[02:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9379.2s)]
*  should be done by family gps and that should be done independently and i think we are massively [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9386.88s)]
*  i'm not being heartless here i'm being frank i think we are massively over diagnosing those with [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9394.88s)]
*  mental illness problems those with other general behavioral disabilities um and i think we're [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9401.92s)]
*  creating a class of victims in britain who will struggle ever to get out of it and that's not [[02:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9409.36s)]
*  good for them and it's not good for us so i worry about those things i do accept though i do accept [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9414.32s)]
*  that repeated lockdowns particularly the third lockdown were probably the biggest mistakes [[02:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9421.92s)]
*  ever made by a peacetime government in this country and they have caused great long-term harm [[02:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9427.519999999999s)]
*  okay and lastly here before i do some one-to-ones with um broadcast emma core from lbc [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9433.439999999999s)]
*  okay we are sorry i apologize we are done and dusted sorry [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9442.96s)]
*  sorry [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9448.16s)]
*  no sadly i think multiculturalism is alive and well that's what we've got the growth of sectarian [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9464.56s)]
*  politics and that's why we got people you know marching on the streets of london it's why we [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9469.119999999999s)]
*  had the provocation against the jewish community that took place in south end last weekend i mean [[02:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9474.64s)]
*  had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country you know the long [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9482.0s)]
*  arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very very quickly i think what has changed [[02:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9487.84s)]
*  is the national narrative the national narrative that multiculturalism is good the encouragement [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9495.76s)]
*  by a labor party in particular you know please let's put you all in separate little boxes [[02:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9502.88s)]
*  let's have identity politics on a massive scale i think that and i think the realization of what [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9508.96s)]
*  a huge error that was has been exposed probably best by trevor phillips you know who was head of [[02:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9515.039999999999s)]
*  the equalities and human rights commission who recognizes that actually encouraging difference [[02:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9521.439999999999s)]
*  was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness whatever differences [[02:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9527.599999999999s)]
*  our backgrounds may be so that's the direction that we firmly want to go in we need to have a [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9535.679999999998s)]
*  shared culture and and that's the danger of allowing a lot of people into a country with [[02:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9541.84s)]
*  whom you have no shared history with whom you have no shared culture with whom you have little in [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9548.24s)]
*  common and i'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that mattered but now we know [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9553.92s)]
*  it matters and the narrative has changed the reality as yet has not let's hope very soon it [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9559.92s)]
*  does thank you very oh adam i thought i mean i can do it now or face to face yeah so you call for a [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9567.28s)]
*  uk doge cutting the size yeah of the state but now you're also calling for a new minister of [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9574.72s)]
*  deportation you're not making the home office even bigger yes but compared to the cost of seven [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9580.24s)]
*  billion pounds a year of dealing with what's coming over the english channel if we can put a stop to [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9586.0s)]
*  that it'll save a lot of money very very quickly indeed thank you sorry yeah again i was gonna do [[02:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9591.52s)]
*  it face to face on camera but i think richard's eyes rubbed that robert kenrith's just in the [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9598.0s)]
*  wrong part i said he was richard is right you know i mean i reckon at least 50 of the conservative [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9604.24s)]
*  mps ought to be in the liberal democrats i reckon about 21 of the torii mps ought to be in reform [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9610.64s)]
*  um i'm not sure which i'm not sure whether i'm not even sure whether jen rick's one of them maybe he [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9618.72s)]
*  is maybe he's genuine maybe he really has been on this damascene conversion i just don't know and i [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9623.52s)]
*  have to say i thought in the leadership contest he was a bit like a a nijel farage impersonator [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9629.36s)]
*  and um i had a chat with him in the gallery uh in the voting lobby shortly after and said well look [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9633.92s)]
*  mate you know if you want some lessons in getting a personality i mean i'm your man you know i can [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9638.72s)]
*  help you um so i don't know but but i think i mean more seriously i think you know kemi badnock's [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9642.56s)]
*  problem is twofold number one if she criticizes what's happening in the english channel if she [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9650.72s)]
*  criticizes mass migration if she criticizes high taxation if she criticizes the increasing size of [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9658.64s)]
*  a state if she criticizes uh the hugely increasing debt burden well what did you do for the last 14 [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9664.88s)]
*  years i mean it's the same with the grooming gangs where was she as minister for women [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9670.64s)]
*  two years she was minister for women didn't mention grooming gangs once that i can see [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9678.16s)]
*  so one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past and i think there are many [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9682.8s)]
*  voters you know you can talk red wall but there are parts of kent here that you know when conservative [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9688.32s)]
*  in 2019 that vote's not coming back that's one problem they've got the second problem they've [[02:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9693.039999999999s)]
*  got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for and i i think what [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9698.08s)]
*  you're going to see on may the first is a lot of conservative voters coming to us but equally [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9705.199999999999s)]
*  quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of the liberal democrats [[02:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9711.2s)]
*  and that you know and they may have been around for 195 years just as the liberals were the [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9718.320000000002s)]
*  natural party of government until the labor party came along in 1918 and i i i think we are [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9724.0s)]
*  potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics where an established party [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9730.560000000001s)]
*  that's been a party of government no longer serves any purpose and it goes back to you know [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9736.32s)]
*  the earlier questions that i was asked by the press association about you know do i want to [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9742.24s)]
*  do deals etc no our aim is to replace the conservative party as the party of opposition [[02:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9747.199999999999s)]
*  to this labor government and that is what we're going to try and do all right thank you very much [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9754.0s)]
*  everybody good morning everybody how fortunate i've been perhaps it was just good judgment [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9758.08s)]
*  in picking zeah as party chairman because the big thing we had to do after the last general [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9766.16s)]
*  election was to professionalize the party and we've done that and i'm very proud of the fact [[02:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9771.2s)]
*  we've managed to put more candidates in the field for may the first than any other party but today [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9776.0s)]
*  i wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue and one that perhaps [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9782.0s)]
*  doesn't impact on the may the first elections but you would be wrong indeed the population explosion [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9786.720000000001s)]
*  that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the lives of more people than any other [[02:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9794.56s)]
*  single issue and it's interesting because up until 1997 this wasn't even a political debate [[02:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9801.439999999999s)]
*  indeed when i was first elected to the european parliament in 1999 immigration didn't appear in [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9810.08s)]
*  my election literature or a manifesto at all and that's because simply from winrush right up until [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9816.72s)]
*  mr blair became prime minister net migration into britain had run at an average of 30 to 50 [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9823.6s)]
*  thousand people a year sometimes higher sometimes lower it wasn't even a debate in successive [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9830.08s)]
*  general elections but the labor party under blair decided that diversity was a good thing something [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9838.0s)]
*  that was never ever to be questioned and that mass immigration would be good for the economy [[02:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9845.2s)]
*  would make us all better off and frankly anybody that dared to even question this up until at least [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9851.76s)]
*  2010 was considered completely and utterly beyond the pale the worst of the worst and i know this [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9858.960000000001s)]
*  because i first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 when it became pretty obvious to [[02:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9867.68s)]
*  me that opening up the door to eight and then 10 former communist countries some of whom had an [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9873.36s)]
*  economy that were only the seventh the size of ours would lead to a huge inflow of people although [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9880.960000000001s)]
*  at least in those days people that came did actually work that sadly has now all changed [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9886.880000000001s)]
*  and since then in every single general election we have been made a series of promises that frankly [[02:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9895.2s)]
*  amount to little more than a pack of lies the public being told what the parties think the [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9902.4s)]
*  public want to hear in fact know from polling what the public want to hear without any intention of [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9909.12s)]
*  delivering on it at all of course the conservatives far worse than tony blair net migration to tens of [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9916.48s)]
*  thousands promised in 2010 2015 2017 and then 2019 we were told substantially lower numbers we now [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9922.56s)]
*  have a labor government who've promised they will radically bring down the numbers coming into [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9930.72s)]
*  britain and we'll find out in june when we get the first ons data whether that's true or the way very [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9936.56s)]
*  much doubt it we've been told by successive prime ministers they would stop the boats [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9942.24s)]
*  even that they would smash the gangs well i'm afraid none of it has come true and i think it's [[02:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9947.519999999999s)]
*  about time we looked at the true cost of the population explosion to this country and i want [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9955.04s)]
*  to make this point very clear that recent polling particularly polling that was published last week [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9961.76s)]
*  in the sun newspaper which was the whole of the midlands of the north showed that we are now by far [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9967.68s)]
*  the most trusted party on this issue and that i am by far the most trusted leader to do something [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9974.640000000001s)]
*  about it it'll be good for the economy is what we were told well 30 years ago seven percent of [[02:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9981.84s)]
*  the workforce were foreign-born today 21 percent of the workforce are foreign-born that has directly [[02:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9987.84s)]
*  led to a pay cut on average of about three percent per worker which of course doesn't really mean [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=9994.880000000001s)]
*  very much if you're earning big money but if you're earning 20 000 pounds a year it does mean quite a [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=10000.880000000001s)]

*  is social housing and we know we do have a shortage of social housing stock in our country [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=10359.279999999999s)]

*  we are running them close in roncorne and hellsby in fact i don't know we might even be doing a touch [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12313.039999999999s)]
*  better than that there's still a week to go if hayward is right if we win that number of seats [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12317.919999999998s)]
*  uh then that will be quite a political revolution we will have to see not long to wait now [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12324.16s)]
*  emma core from global [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12331.2s)]
*  yeah i think the conservative candidate in cambridge is not living within the constituency [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12345.84s)]
*  either so i think this is not something that's uncommon um andrea has got accommodation in [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12349.2s)]
*  lincoln uh she's born and bred in lincolnshire she was a county councillor for boston her [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12353.6s)]
*  grandfather was a fisherman in grimsby her links with lincolnshire are pretty clear and strong [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12359.04s)]
*  she did win a surprise election in leads you know when she when um she beat the um the dancing star [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12364.640000000001s)]
*  and star of tv uh breakfast tv now um ed so unsurprisingly she got a property in that constituency [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12372.56s)]
*  and the one factor here that is difficult is that there is a seven-year-old boy who has quite severe [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12381.279999999999s)]
*  educational learning difficulties and she said look if she's elected as mayor of greater lincolnshire [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12391.359999999999s)]
*  she will find the right school for him near lincoln that's not something you can do literally [[03:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12396.88s)]
*  overnight so you know she's living between the two that is a fact uh the fact this vexay really [[03:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12402.8s)]
*  quite vexatious complaints been put in let me tell you this if they say that andrea has broken the [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12409.439999999999s)]
*  rules on friday tomorrow at this hearing do you know what it'll mean it'll mean the entire [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12414.56s)]
*  mayoral election is rerun it won't mean just that she's disqualified the whole thing will have to be [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12421.359999999999s)]
*  rerun and i don't think the voters of lincolnshire would like that very much so i expect tomorrow [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12427.439999999999s)]
*  we get a common sense judgment that is based around the fact her situation and she's a single [[03:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12433.759999999998s)]
*  mum now her situation with a seven-year-old boy with bad learning difficulties explains to some [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12438.96s)]
*  extent why she is where she is all right we will find out tomorrow morning who was we [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12445.2s)]
*  um we got noah hoffman from the sun hello um niger how would you enjoy you talking about [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12451.2s)]
*  discriminating and making sure to buy choosing choosing right migrants um if they're highly [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12458.240000000002s)]
*  still comes to the uk to stop this um concerning trend of secretary of politics that we see in the [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12464.400000000001s)]
*  comments and just generally um in sort of local areas how would you ensure that any new migrants [[03:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12470.64s)]
*  um have british values and are very determined to integrate where some have not well i think one of [[03:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12477.92s)]
*  the big cons with this and one of the reasons that major problems have built up in in some of our [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12484.08s)]
*  inner cities and northern towns in particular is because of this family reunion policy [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12489.279999999999s)]
*  well you know somebody comes in as a low-skill worker let's say for argument's sake [[03:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12495.359999999999s)]
*  might work for a bit might then be on benefits is then allowed to bring extended family from [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12499.839999999998s)]
*  wherever it may be they come in uh they don't learn the language they fail at school they become [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12504.16s)]
*  part of that welfareism system and i think it's within that environment it's within that environment [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12511.519999999999s)]
*  that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive so i think we have to be much much more [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12517.92s)]
*  rigorous about family reunion which of course makes up such a large number of those that have [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12523.119999999999s)]
*  come to britain and you know some will say that's tough that's unfair but look what the result of it [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12528.0s)]
*  has been it certainly hasn't been a positive one um okay we've got uh camilla from the daily express [[03:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12532.48s)]
*  that's the end of the video you're doing the video right if you ever gave me this list is info um a [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12542.88s)]
*  bit of a talking to you um okay who else we got we've got uh joshua from bauer media group [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12548.08s)]
*  about revising a set needs a straighter kind of development services in locating [[03:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12558.0s)]
*  it's initially impact parents in this country there and that's what it's counted in parents [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12562.24s)]
*  across the country i mean i'm just what needs to be done to make sure that parents are supported [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12565.92s)]
*  and that just to ease the burden that currently in here yeah it's a massive problem i i have to [[03:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12570.8s)]
*  say for my own money um when you get to 18 um and you put somebody on a disability [[03:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12575.76s)]
*  uh register unemployed uh with a high level of benefits uh you're telling people aged 18 that [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12584.72s)]
*  they're that they're victims and if you are told you're a victim and you think you're a victim [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12592.4s)]
*  you are very likely to stay as a victim and so many of these diagnoses you know for send [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12600.0s)]
*  before 18 for disability register after 18 so many of these have been conducted on zoom [[03:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12608.72s)]
*  with the family gp right i think that is a massive mistake i think if you're you know if i'm your [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12619.44s)]
*  family gp and i've known your family for generations and you're saying to me doc there's a real problem [[03:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12628.48s)]
*  here with depression or whatever it may be it's quite hard for me as you as your gp to say no [[03:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12634.72s)]
*  so i don't think any i don't think any of these allocations should be done [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12641.679999999998s)]
*  by family gps and that they should be done independently and i think we are massively [[03:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12646.32s)]
*  i'm not being heartless here i'm being frank i think we are massively over diagnosing those [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12653.359999999999s)]
*  with mental illness problems those with other general behavioral disabilities um and i think [[03:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12660.24s)]
*  we're creating a class of victims in britain who will struggle ever to get out of it and that's [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12667.76s)]
*  not good for them and it's not good for us so i worry about those things i do accept though [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12672.72s)]
*  i do accept that repeated lockdowns particularly the third lockdown were probably the biggest [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12678.96s)]
*  mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country and they have caused great long-term [[03:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12684.88s)]
*  harm okay and lastly here before i do some one-to-ones with um broadcast emma core from lbc [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12690.96s)]
*  right okay we are sorry i apologize we are done and dusted sorry [[03:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12701.119999999999s)]
*  sorry [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12706.64s)]
*  no sadly i think multiculturalism is alive and well that's what we've got the growth of sectarian [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12723.119999999999s)]
*  politics and that's why we got people you know marching on the streets of london it's why we [[03:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12727.599999999999s)]
*  had the provocation against the jewish community that took place in south end last weekend [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12733.12s)]
*  had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12740.480000000001s)]
*  you know the long arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very very quickly [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12745.68s)]
*  i think what has changed is the national narrative the national narrative that multiculturalism [[03:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12752.240000000002s)]
*  is good the encouragement by a labor party in particular you know please let's put you all in [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12759.2s)]
*  separate little boxes let's have identity politics on a massive scale i think that and i think the [[03:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12765.76s)]
*  realization of what a huge error that was has been exposed probably best by trevor phillips [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12771.84s)]
*  you know who was head of the equalities and human rights commission who recognizes that actually [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12779.04s)]
*  encouraging difference was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12783.76s)]
*  whatever differences our backgrounds may be so that's the direction that we firmly want to go in [[03:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12792.880000000001s)]
*  uh we we need to have a shared culture and and that's the danger of allowing a lot of [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12798.56s)]
*  people into a country with whom you have no shared history with whom you have no shared culture with [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12805.12s)]
*  whom you have little in common uh and i'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that [[03:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12811.12s)]
*  mattered but now we know it matters and the narrative has changed the reality as yet has not [[03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12817.2s)]
*  let's hope very soon it does thank you very oh adam i thought i mean i can do it now or face to [[03:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12824.08s)]
*  face yeah um so you call for a uk doge cutting the size of the state but now you're also calling [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12830.08s)]
*  for a new minister of deportation you're not making the home office even bigger yes but compared [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12837.84s)]
*  to the cost of seven billion pounds a year of dealing with what's coming over the english [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12842.56s)]
*  channel if we can put a stop to that it'll save a lot of money very very quickly indeed thank you [[03:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12848.24s)]
*  sorry yeah again i was gonna do it face to face on camera but [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12855.2s)]
*  but [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12857.6s)]
*  i'm not sure whether i'm not even sure whether jen rick's one of them maybe he is maybe he's [[03:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12878.56s)]
*  genuine maybe he really has been on this damascene conversion i just don't know and i have to say i [[03:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12882.88s)]
*  thought in the leadership contest he was a bit like a a nijel farage impersonator and um i had [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12888.48s)]
*  a chat with him in the gallery uh in the voting lobby shortly after and said well look mate you [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12893.359999999999s)]
*  know if you want some lessons in getting a personality i mean i'm your man you know i can [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12897.519999999999s)]
*  help you um so i don't know but but i think i mean more seriously i think you know kemi badnock's [[03:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12901.039999999999s)]
*  problem is twofold number one if she criticizes what's happening in the english channel if she [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12909.28s)]
*  criticizes mass migration if she criticizes high taxation if she criticizes the increasing size of [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12917.12s)]
*  a state if she criticizes uh the hugely increasing debt burden well what did you do for the last 14 [[03:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12923.44s)]
*  years i mean it's the same with the grooming gangs where was she as minister for women [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12929.12s)]
*  two years she was minister for women didn't mention grooming gangs once that i can see [[03:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12935.36s)]
*  so one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past and i think there are many [[03:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12941.28s)]
*  voters you know you can talk red wall but there are parts of kent here that you know went [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12946.800000000001s)]
*  conservative in 2019 that vote's not coming back that's one problem they've got the second [[03:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12950.960000000001s)]
*  problem they've got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12956.0s)]
*  and i i think what you're going to see on may the first is a lot of conservative voters coming to [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12962.0s)]
*  us but equally quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of liberal [[03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12968.24s)]
*  democrats and that you know and they may have been around for 195 years just as the liberals [[03:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12975.12s)]
*  were the natural party of government until the labor party came along in 1918 and i i i think [[03:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12982.24s)]
*  we are potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics where an [[03:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12988.16s)]
*  established party there's been a party of government no longer serves any purpose and it goes back to [[03:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=12994.0s)]
*  you know the earlier questions um that i was asked by the press association about you know do i want [[03:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13000.48s)]
*  to do deals etc um no our aim is to replace the conservative party as the party of opposition [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13005.52s)]
*  to this labor government and that is what we're going to try and do all right thank you very much [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13012.48s)]
*  everybody good morning everybody how fortunate i've been or perhaps it was just good judgment [[03:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13016.56s)]
*  in picking zeah as party chairman because the big thing we had to do after the last general election [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13024.56s)]
*  was to professionalize the party and we've done that and i'm very proud of the fact we've managed [[03:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13030.08s)]
*  to put more candidates in the field for may the first than any other party but today i wanted to [[03:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13034.8s)]
*  talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue and one that perhaps doesn't impact [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13040.88s)]
*  on the may the first elections but you would be wrong indeed the population explosion that has [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13046.32s)]
*  happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the lives of more people than any other single [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13053.36s)]
*  issue and it's interesting because up until 1997 this wasn't even a political debate indeed when [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13060.56s)]

*  more than a pack of lies the public being told what the parties think the public want to hear in [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13161.92s)]

*  to make this point very clear that recent polling particularly polling that was published last week [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13220.24s)]
*  in the sun newspaper which was the whole of the midlands of the north showed that we are now by [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13226.16s)]

*  about it it'll be good for the economy is what we were told well 30 years ago seven percent of [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13240.32s)]

*  very much if you're earning big money but if you're earning 20 000 pounds a year it does mean quite a [[03:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13259.279999999999s)]

*  and utterly covered up the impact of course on wages is worse than that given that there are [[03:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13277.359999999999s)]
*  500 000 700 000 who knows people working in the illegal economy leading to further wage suppression [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13283.199999999999s)]

*  because everybody that is here has come to work well try this statistic for size foreign-born [[03:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13296.8s)]
*  workers are 40 percent higher likely to be unemployed than british-born workers 40 percent [[03:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13303.6s)]

*  that look most people come here to work so what is there to complain about what i'm afraid that [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13325.199999999999s)]

*  by the time they reach retirement let alone what that will be afterwards so let us be clear [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13385.52s)]

*  simply won't do those jobs but we're told it's okay because we're growing we're getting richer [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13413.68s)]

*  um and she's trying too but i did try to make the argument that actually gdp in gross figures [[03:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13434.960000000001s)]
*  doesn't mean very much when you have a population that's rising by three quarters of a million [[03:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13442.32s)]
*  or a million every year directly as a result of open borders why not look at gdp per capita [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13447.279999999999s)]
*  but no nobody wants to engage with that well the last two years have seen record levels of migration [[03:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13455.119999999999s)]

*  as a result of policies started by the labor party accelerated by the conservative party and [[03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13469.92s)]
*  now being continued by labor none of which of course means that we in this country don't want [[03:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=13476.08s)]

*  that's one thing they could do they could outright refuse to have migrant hotels or hmos imposed [[04:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15427.28s)]
*  upon them they could be damn difficult and and actually what you've seen in parliament over the [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15432.800000000001s)]
*  last five years you know individual cases i mean pretty patel's constituency you know migrant [[04:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15437.36s)]

*  the hotel was closed down and moved to a different constituency so you do get mps who are able already [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15448.0s)]
*  you know if they're in a position of power to perhaps ease things for their constituents [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15453.279999999999s)]
*  that's what we could do but now you know there is an enormous burden from all of this but what a [[04:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15457.519999999999s)]
*  but but what a kent county council can do you know is as i say find out who the road contractor [[04:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15462.24s)]
*  what they're costing why they're so ineffective you know why is all this money being spent on [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15469.199999999999s)]
*  wellness and i just think county councils you know we know what the basic job of a county council is [[04:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15473.92s)]
*  i think they've extended way beyond that remit okay moving on william john russell from reuters [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15479.76s)]
*  another Reuters. Okay, Emine Shumaz from The Guardian. [[04:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15486.88s)]

*  I'll buy him a big lunch if he's right. I don't know. I don't know. I came into this [[04:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15506.88s)]
*  campaign and obviously we're very, very upset that Essex, that Suffolk, that [[04:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15512.24s)]
*  Norfolk, that East Sussex, West Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight, I'm running out [[04:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15518.72s)]
*  now, there's probably another one there somewhere, and the fact that five and a [[04:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15524.92s)]
*  half million, sorry, sorry, the fact that five and a half million people have been [[04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15527.6s)]
*  denied their vote in what was some of our very strongest counties, we're very, [[04:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15530.8s)]
*  very angry about and there's no argument for it. You know, Angela Reiner's so-called [[04:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15536.48s)]
*  devolution of local government applies equally to Kent as it does to Essex and [[04:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15540.8s)]
*  yet this side of the estuary are voting and that side are not. So I said at the [[04:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15545.279999999999s)]
*  start of the campaign my aim, my goal, my ambition was to win 200 county council [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15549.56s)]
*  or unitary equivalent seats. That was my aim. The other aim of course has been to [[04:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15555.0s)]
*  take on Labour in Runcourt and Helsby, which is I understand their 16th safest [[04:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15560.359999999999s)]
*  seat in Britain, and to run them close. That was another aim that I set for May [[04:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15565.08s)]
*  the 1st. Let me tell you, we are running them close in Runcourt and Helsby. In [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15570.039999999999s)]
*  fact, I don't know, we might even be doing a touch better than that. There's [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15574.88s)]
*  still a week to go. If Haywood is right, if we win that number of seats, then that [[04:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15577.4s)]
*  will be quite a political revolution. We will have to see, not long to wait now. [[04:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15583.279999999999s)]
*  Emma Core from Global. [[04:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15589.08s)]
*  What do you make of the row whether Dame Andrea Jenkins is eligible to run as [[04:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15591.0s)]
*  report mayor in Lincolnshire? She's living in Yorkshire, isn't she? Not within the region as per the rules. Have you sorted this out? [[04:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15597.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Conservative candidate in Cambridge is not living within the [[04:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15604.0s)]
*  constituency either, so I think this is not something that's uncommon. Andrea has [[04:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15607.24s)]
*  got accommodation in Lincoln. She's born and bred in Lincolnshire. She was a [[04:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15611.24s)]
*  county councillor for Boston. Her grandfather was a fisherman in Grimsby. [[04:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15615.56s)]
*  Her links with Lincolnshire are pretty clear and strong. She did win a surprise [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15619.48s)]
*  election in Leeds, you know, when she beat the dancing star and star of [[04:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15624.48s)]
*  breakfast TV now. So unsurprisingly, she got a property in that [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15631.64s)]
*  constituency. The one factor here that is difficult is that there is a [[04:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15638.039999999999s)]
*  seven-year-old boy who has quite severe educational learning difficulties and [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15645.04s)]
*  she said, look, if she's elected as mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, she will find [[04:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15651.880000000001s)]
*  the right school for him near Lincoln. That's not something you can do literally [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15656.080000000002s)]
*  overnight. So, you know, she's living between the two. That is a fact. The fact [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15661.240000000002s)]
*  is really quite vexatious complaints being put in. Let me tell you this. If [[04:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15667.04s)]
*  they say that Andrea has broken the rules on Friday tomorrow at this hearing, [[04:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15671.6s)]
*  do you know what it'll mean? It'll mean the entire mayoral election is rerun. It [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15676.08s)]
*  won't mean just that she's disqualified. The whole thing will have to be rerun [[04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15683.0s)]
*  and I don't think the voters of Lincolnshire would like that very much. So [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15686.36s)]
*  I expect tomorrow we get a common-sense judgment that is based around the fact [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15690.44s)]
*  her situation, and she's a single mum now, her situation with a seven-year-old [[04:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15695.32s)]
*  boy with bad learning difficulties, explains to some extent why she is where [[04:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15700.0s)]
*  she is. All right, we will find out tomorrow morning. Who was we? We got Noah Hoffman [[04:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15705.12s)]
*  from The Sun. Hello. Nigel, how would you intro you to about discriminating and making sure to [[04:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15711.4s)]
*  right choosing right migrants if they're highly skilled come to the UK? To stop this [[04:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15718.48s)]
*  concerning trend of sectarian politics that we see in the comments and generally in local areas. How would you [[04:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15725.76s)]
*  ensure that any new migrants have British values and are very determined to integrate where some have not? [[04:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15733.56s)]
*  Well, I think one of the big cons with this and one of the reasons that major [[04:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15741.28s)]
*  problems have built up in some of our inner cities and northern towns in [[04:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15744.76s)]
*  particular is because of this family reunion policy. Well, you know, somebody [[04:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15749.880000000001s)]
*  comes in as a low-skilled worker, let's say, for argument's sake, might work for a bit, might then be on benefits, is then allowed to bring extended family from wherever it may be. [[04:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15754.64s)]
*  They come in, they don't learn the language, they fail at school, they become part of that welfareism system, and I think it's within that environment. [[04:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15763.64s)]
*  It's within that environment that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive. So I think we have to be much, much more rigorous about family reunion, [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15774.64s)]
*  which of course makes up such a large number of those that have come to Britain. And, you know, some will say that's tough, that's unfair, but look what the result of it has been. It certainly hasn't been a positive one. [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15783.76s)]
*  OK, we've got Camilla from the Daily Express. [[04:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15794.76s)]
*  That's the other video. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15799.76s)]
*  You're doing the video, right. Whoever gave me this list is in for a bit of a talking to. [[04:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15802.76s)]
*  OK, who else have we got? We've got Joshua from Bauer Media Group. [[04:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15810.76s)]
*  You mentioned about revising a set of straight-up economy development services in Logan. It's initially impacted parents in this country, parents in this county, and parents across the country. [[04:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15815.76s)]
*  What needs to be done to make sure that parents are supported and that just to ease the burden that they currently feel? [[04:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15825.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a massive problem. I have to say for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed with a high level of benefits, you're telling people aged 18 that they're victims. [[04:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15831.76s)]
*  And if you are told you're a victim and you think you're a victim, you are very likely to stay as a victim. [[04:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15853.76s)]
*  And so many of these diagnoses, you know, for send before 18, for disability register after 18, so many of these have been conducted on Zoom with the family GP. [[04:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15861.76s)]
*  I think that is a massive mistake. I think if you're, you know, if I'm your family GP and I've known your family for generations and you're saying to me, there's a real problem here with depression or whatever it may be, it's quite hard for me as your GP to say no. [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15878.76s)]
*  So I don't think any, I don't think any of these allocations should be done by family GPs and that should be done independently. [[04:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15898.76s)]
*  And I think we are massively, I'm not being heartless here, I'm being frank. I think we are massively over diagnosing those with mental illness problems, those with other general behavioral disabilities. [[04:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15907.76s)]
*  I think we're creating a class of victims in Britain who will struggle ever to get out of it and that's not good for them and it's not good for us. [[04:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15924.76s)]
*  So I worry about those things. I do accept though, I do accept that repeated lockdowns, particularly the third lockdown, were probably the biggest mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country and they have caused great long term harm. [[04:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15932.76s)]
*  Okay and lastly here before I do some one to ones with broadcast, Emma Core from LBC. [[04:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15949.76s)]
*  I've had one. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15957.76s)]
*  You've had one. [[04:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15958.76s)]
*  Okay, we are sorry, I apologize. We are done and dusted. Sorry. [[04:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15959.76s)]
*  I'm from the Daily Teeth podcast. [[04:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15964.76s)]
*  I didn't know you were here, thank you. [[04:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15967.76s)]
*  I just wanted to ask, we've got an article on the website today about multiculturalism and how it's failed. [[04:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15969.76s)]
*  I saw it, yeah. [[04:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15974.76s)]
*  I wanted to ask, do you think multiculturalism is dead now in this country and if so, why? [[04:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15975.76s)]
*  No sadly I think multiculturalism is alive and well. That's why we've got the growth of sectarian politics and that's why we've got people marching on the streets of London. [[04:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15981.76s)]
*  It's why we had the provocation against the Jewish community that took place in Southend last weekend. [[04:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15990.76s)]
*  I mean had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country, you know the long arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very, very quickly. [[04:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=15997.76s)]
*  I think what has changed is the national narrative. The national narrative that multiculturalism is good. [[04:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16008.76s)]
*  The encouragement by a Labour Party in particular, you know, please let's put you all in separate little boxes. [[04:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16017.76s)]
*  Let's have identity politics on a massive scale. [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16024.76s)]
*  I think that and I think the realization of what a huge error that was has been exposed probably best by Trevor Phillips, you know, who was head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, [[04:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16027.76s)]
*  who recognizes that actually encouraging difference was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness, whatever differences our backgrounds may be. [[04:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16039.76s)]
*  So that's the direction that we firmly want to go in. We need to have a shared culture and that's the danger of allowing a lot of people into a country with whom you have no shared history, [[04:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16053.76s)]
*  with whom you have no shared culture, with whom you have little in common. [[04:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16066.76s)]
*  And I'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that mattered. [[04:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16071.76s)]
*  But now we know it matters and the narrative has changed. The reality as yet has not. Let's hope very soon it does. [[04:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16075.76s)]
*  Thank you very Adam. I can do it now or face to face. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16084.76s)]
*  Yeah. So you call for a UK Doge cutting the size of the state. [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16088.76s)]
*  But now you're also calling for a new minister of deportation. You're not making the Home Office even bigger. [[04:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16094.76s)]
*  Yes, but compared to the cost of seven billion pounds a year of dealing with what's coming over the English Channel, if we can put a stop to that, it'll save a lot of money very, very quickly indeed. [[04:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16098.76s)]
*  Thank you. Sorry. Yeah. Again, I was going to face to face on camera. [[04:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16111.76s)]
*  Richard Sizer. [[04:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16115.76s)]
*  I said, you have Richard is right. You know, I mean, I reckon at least 50 of the conservative MPs ought to be in the Liberal Democrats. [[04:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16118.76s)]
*  I reckon about 21 of the Tory MPs ought to be in reform. [[04:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16129.76s)]
*  I'm not sure which I'm not sure whether I'm not even sure whether Jen Rick's one of them. Maybe he is. Maybe he's genuine. [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16134.76s)]
*  Maybe he really has been on this dammasing conversion. I just don't know. [[04:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16141.76s)]
*  And I have to say, I thought in the leadership contest, he was a bit like a Nigel Farage impersonator. [[04:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16145.76s)]
*  And I had a chat with him in the gallery in the voting lobby shortly after. [[04:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16150.76s)]
*  I said, well, look, mate, you know, if you want some lessons in getting a personality, I mean, I'm your man. [[04:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16154.76s)]
*  You know, I can help you. So I don't know. [[04:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16158.76s)]
*  But I think I mean, more seriously, I think. [[04:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16161.76s)]
*  You know, can we bad knocks problem is twofold. [[04:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16166.76s)]
*  Number one, if she criticizes what's happening in the English Channel, if she criticizes mass migration, if she criticizes high taxation, [[04:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16170.76s)]
*  if she criticizes the increasing size of the state, if she criticizes the hugely increasing debt burden. [[04:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16179.76s)]
*  Well, what did you do for the last 14 years? I mean, it's the same with the grooming gangs. [[04:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16185.76s)]
*  Where was she as Minister for Women? [[04:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16191.76s)]
*  Two years she was Minister for Women. Didn't mention grooming gangs once that I can see. [[04:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16194.76s)]
*  So one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past. [[04:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16198.76s)]
*  And I think there are many voters. You can talk Redwall, but the part of Kent here that, you know, went conservative in 2019. [[04:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16203.76s)]
*  That vote's not coming back. That's one problem they've got. [[04:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16210.76s)]
*  The second problem they've got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for. [[04:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16213.76s)]
*  And I think what you're going to see on May the first is a lot of conservative voters coming to us, [[04:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16219.76s)]
*  but equally quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of the Liberal Democrats. [[04:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16226.76s)]
*  And that, you know, and they may have been around for 195 years. [[04:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16233.76s)]
*  Just as the liberals with the natural party of government until the Labour Party came along in 1918. [[04:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16237.76s)]
*  And I think we are potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics where an established party, [[04:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16244.76s)]
*  there's been a party of government, no longer serves any purpose. [[04:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16252.76s)]
*  And it goes back to the earlier questions that I was asked by the Press Association about, you know, do I want to do deals, et cetera? [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16256.76s)]
*  No, our aim is to replace the Conservative Party as the party of opposition to this Labour government. [[04:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16265.76s)]
*  And that is what we're going to try and do. Thank you very much, everybody. [[04:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16271.76s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. How fortunate I've been, or perhaps it was just good judgment in picking Zia as party chairman, [[04:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16276.76s)]
*  because the big thing we had to do after the last general election was to professionalise the party. [[04:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16284.76s)]
*  And we've done that. I'm very proud of the fact we've managed to put more candidates in the field for May the first than any other party. [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16290.76s)]
*  But today I wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue and one that perhaps doesn't impact on the May the first elections. [[04:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16297.76s)]
*  But you would be wrong. Indeed, the population explosion that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the lives of more people than any other single issue. [[04:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16305.76s)]
*  And it's interesting because up until 1997, this wasn't even a political debate. [[04:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16318.76s)]
*  Indeed, when I was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999, immigration didn't appear in my election literature or a manifesto at all. [[04:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16325.76s)]
*  And that's because simply from when rush right up until Mr Blair became prime minister, net migration into Britain had run an average of 30 to 50,000 people a year, sometimes higher, sometimes lower. [[04:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16335.76s)]
*  It wasn't even a debate in successive general elections. [[04:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16350.76s)]
*  But the Labour Party under Blair decided that diversity was a good thing, something that was never ever to be questioned and that mass immigration would be good for the economy, would make us all better off. [[04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16355.76s)]
*  And frankly, anybody that dared to even question this up until at least 2010 was considered completely and utterly beyond the pale, the worst of the worst. [[04:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16369.76s)]
*  And I know this because I first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 when it became pretty obvious to me that opening up the door to eight and then 10 former communist countries, [[04:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16382.76s)]
*  some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size of ours, would lead to a huge inflow of people, although at least in those days people that came did actually work. [[04:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16396.76s)]
*  That sadly has now all changed. [[04:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16406.76s)]
*  And since then, in every single general election, we've been made a series of promises that frankly amount to little more than a pack of lies. [[04:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16410.76s)]
*  The public being told what the parties think the public want to hear, in fact, know from polling what the public want to hear without any intention of delivering on it at all. [[04:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16421.76s)]
*  Of course, the Conservatives are far worse than Tony Blair. [[04:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16433.76s)]
*  Net migration to tens of thousands promised in 2010, 2015, 2017 and then 2019. [[04:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16436.76s)]
*  We were told substantially lower numbers. [[04:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16443.76s)]
*  We now have a Labour government who have promised they will radically bring down the numbers coming into Britain and we'll find out in June when we get the first data, whether that's true or though I very much doubt it. [[04:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16446.76s)]
*  We've been told by successive prime ministers they would stop the boats, even that they would smash the gangs. [[04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16459.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid none of it has come true. [[04:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16466.76s)]
*  And I think it's about time we looked at the true cost of the population explosion to this country. [[04:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16470.76s)]
*  And I want to make this point very clear that recent polling, particularly polling that was published last week in the Sun newspaper, which was the whole of the Midlands of the North, showed that we are now by far the most trusted party on this issue and that I am by far the most trusted leader to do something about it. [[04:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16477.76s)]
*  It'll be good for the economy is what we were told. [[04:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16499.76s)]
*  Well, 30 years ago, 7% of the workforce were foreign born. [[04:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16502.76s)]
*  Today, 21% of the workforce are foreign born. [[04:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16505.76s)]
*  That has directly led to a pay cut on average of about 3% per worker, which, of course, doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money. [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16510.76s)]
*  But if you're earning 20,000 pounds a year, it does mean quite a lot. [[04:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16519.76s)]
*  Quite a lot. And interestingly, the Bank of England in 2015 produced a report showing a direct link between numbers of foreign born workers and wage suppression. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16522.76s)]
*  Yet the whole thing was completely and utterly covered up. [[04:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16532.76s)]
*  The impact, of course, on wages is worse than that, given that there are 500,000 700,000 who knows people working in the illegal economy, leading to further wage suppression. [[04:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16537.76s)]
*  The greatest myth, of course, is that it will be good for us. [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16550.76s)]
*  And you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here has come to work. [[04:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16554.76s)]
*  Well, try this statistic for size. [[04:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16558.76s)]
*  Foreign born workers are 40% higher likely to be unemployed than British born workers. [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16560.76s)]
*  40% higher for foreign born people to be on the unemployment register. [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16569.76s)]
*  It's not a statistic I'd ever heard before. [[04:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16576.76s)]
*  It's pretty mind blowing. [[04:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16578.76s)]
*  And even the argument that, look, most people come here to work. [[04:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16580.76s)]
*  So what is there to complain about? [[04:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16584.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid that doesn't work either, because in the last six years, net three million people have settled in Britain from outside of Europe. [[04:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16586.76s)]
*  And of those, only 16% came on work visas. [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16596.76s)]
*  It's completely mind blowing number. [[04:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16600.76s)]
*  Now it's true to say that many of those who've come perhaps will enter the workforce. [[04:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16603.76s)]
*  But you begin to understand that the argument for mass migration that is needed for the labor market actually isn't true. [[04:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16608.76s)]
*  Well, the majority that come, come as dependents. [[04:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16615.76s)]
*  The Center for Migration Studies recently published that since 2020, unemployment benefits to foreign born people have been 36 billion pounds. [[04:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16619.76s)]
*  We are talking simply about eye watering numbers. [[04:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16630.76s)]
*  The other statistic that I was surprised by was that low paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer 150,000 pounds by the time they reach retirement, let alone what that will be afterwards. [[04:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16635.76s)]
*  So let us be clear. [[04:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16648.76s)]
*  Non selective, in many case, non working mass migration into Britain has made everybody in this country poorer, except, of course, for big employers who love much cheap migrant foreign labor as they can possibly get their hands on. [[04:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16650.76s)]
*  As the argument grows every year that British people simply won't do those jobs. [[04:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16668.76s)]
*  But we're told it's okay because we're growing. [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16676.76s)]
*  We're getting richer. [[04:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16679.76s)]
*  Gross domestic products is going up. [[04:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16681.76s)]
*  And that's the only measure that anybody on the two front benches in Parliament will ever talk about. [[04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16683.76s)]
*  I did try the other day with Rachel Reeves and she's trying to. [[04:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16689.76s)]
*  But I did try to make the argument that actually GDP in gross figures doesn't mean very much when you have a population that's rising by three quarters of a million or a million every year directly as a result of open borders. [[04:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16694.76s)]
*  Why not look at GDP per capita? [[04:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16709.76s)]
*  But no, nobody wants to engage with that. [[04:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16712.76s)]
*  Well, the last two years have seen record levels of migration into Britain and GDP per capita has fallen in six of the last eight quarters. [[04:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16714.76s)]
*  We are getting poorer as a result of policies started by the Labour Party accelerated by the Conservative Party and now being continued by Labour, none of which, of course, means that we in this country don't want high skilled, law abiding people to come into Britain. [[04:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16725.76s)]
*  To work, pay taxes, add to our society. [[04:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16743.76s)]
*  All of those things are good. [[04:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16746.76s)]
*  But we have to. [[04:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16748.76s)]
*  We have to discriminate. [[04:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16750.76s)]
*  Yes, that's that's the word I'm going to use. [[04:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16751.76s)]
*  It means choose. [[04:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16753.76s)]
*  We have to discriminate in terms of who comes into our country and in what numbers to try and have a rational debate about housing is virtually impossible. [[04:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16754.76s)]
*  I've been trying for over 10 years to engage other party leaders in a rational debate about the terrible housing shortage, the cost of housing and rents in this country. [[04:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16766.76s)]
*  Nobody will engage with me. [[04:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16776.76s)]
*  Of the house price rises that we've had over the last two decades, 25 percent of that is directly down to immigration and the rising population. [[04:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16779.76s)]
*  Indeed, even the Ministry of Housing themselves said in 2018 again, suppressed, not publicized, that a one percent increase in the number of households leads to a two percent increase in cost. [[04:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16791.76s)]
*  And just think on this. [[04:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16805.76s)]
*  There were twenty three point seven million households when Mr Blair came to power. [[04:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16807.76s)]
*  There are now twenty eight point five million households. [[04:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16811.76s)]
*  Net migration has increased the population by ten million in the last 20 years. [[04:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16816.76s)]
*  And the same goes for rent. [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16823.76s)]
*  Even in recent years, a third of rent rises since 2020 are directly down to rising population, which means for the average renter, another thousand pounds a year. [[04:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16824.76s)]
*  And think on this. [[04:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16837.76s)]
*  This government is determined to build one and a half million new homes in the lifetime of this parliament, just as the government before was committed to the same figure. [[04:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16838.76s)]
*  That will not have any impact on the housing crisis in Britain in any way at all. [[04:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16848.76s)]
*  We currently have to build a new house every two minutes. [[04:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16854.76s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16858.76s)]
*  We have to build one new house every two minutes just to cope with levels of net migration into Britain. [[04:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16859.76s)]
*  Not dealing at all with the backlog that we built up and perhaps one of the areas that is causing the most angst is social housing. [[04:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16867.76s)]
*  And we know we do have a shortage of social housing stock in our country. [[04:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16876.76s)]
*  But somebody who comes into the Port of Dover, a young man without any documents who's come from goodness, knows where, who believes in who knows what. [[04:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16882.76s)]
*  Once they once they give an indefinite leave to remain, and we increasingly do that because we find it too difficult to deport anybody anywhere, they then effectively are homeless, which means, of course, they go straight to the top of the of the social housing list. [[04:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16890.76s)]
*  It's happening in every county. [[04:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16905.76s)]
*  Just one example, Northumberland last year, hundreds of asylum seekers have been given indefinite leave to remain, went straight to the top of the housing queue, whilst there were 14,000 people, families on the list who were put, I'm afraid, to the back. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16907.76s)]
*  That's just one county example, but it's happening literally everywhere. [[04:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16921.76s)]
*  But it's OK. [[04:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16925.76s)]
*  We're told we wouldn't be able to have a National Health Service if it wasn't for increasing net migration into Britain. [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16926.76s)]
*  That is what we've been told over and over and over. [[04:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16932.76s)]
*  And you'll still hear those arguments on BBC Question Time pretty much every week. [[04:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16935.76s)]
*  We need foreign doctors and nurses. [[04:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16940.76s)]
*  Well, I would put a different argument to you. [[04:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16942.76s)]
*  I would say we should probably be ashamed of ourselves for taking over 100,000 doctors and nurses from the Red List, from underdeveloped countries where undoubtedly those medical experts are needed even more than they're needed here. [[04:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16944.76s)]
*  Amazing to think 100,000 workers in 25 years coming from countries that need them more than us. [[04:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16961.76s)]
*  And yet right at the moment, we only have nine and a half thousand people in medical training of any kind at all. [[04:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16966.76s)]
*  It's almost as if the NHS is happier to take on agency staff from West Africa. [[04:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16973.76s)]
*  And we've sort of lost the idea that we should be training enough of our own doctors and nurses. [[04:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16979.76s)]
*  And perhaps one of the biggest political issues in Britain that affects people's lives is access to a GP appointment, something that we pretty much took as a birthright, to be honest. [[04:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16986.76s)]
*  Well, have a think about this. [[04:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16995.76s)]
*  Seven point two million foreign born people have registered with GPs in the last 10 years. [[04:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=16997.76s)]
*  And you're surprised you can't get an NHS appointment. [[04:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17005.76s)]
*  All I'm doing here is giving you cold, hard facts, all of which I can back up if you want further documentation. [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17010.76s)]
*  I'm telling you the truth about the terrible, terrible mistakes that have been made by both of our so-called main parties. [[04:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17019.76s)]
*  And one that is very difficult to talk about, because you're always told that you're scapegoating, you're saying something that is truly beastly, is crime. [[04:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17026.76s)]
*  Mass immigration has increased crime in this country in actually quite a dramatic way. [[04:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17035.76s)]
*  Foreign born nationals are 71 percent more likely to be convicted of sexual assault, 69 percent more likely to be convicted of drug offenses, [[04:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17042.76s)]
*  39 percent more likely to be convicted of any kind of crime. [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17055.76s)]
*  One in 50 Albanians in Britain is in jail. [[04:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17061.76s)]
*  Now what does that tell you? Does it tell you that the whole of Albania is rotten, that they're all awful? [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17065.76s)]
*  No, what it tells you is if you come from a poorer country, there are richer pickings in crime in London and Birmingham and Manchester, [[04:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17069.76s)]
*  and frankly even Dover, than there are where you come from. [[04:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17078.76s)]
*  It's why I return to my point. [[04:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17082.76s)]
*  We must discriminate when it comes to who can come into our country. [[04:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17084.76s)]
*  We must choose who the right people are. [[04:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17089.76s)]
*  Regardless of race, religion or geography, are these people going to contribute to British society? [[04:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17091.76s)]
*  Are these people going to integrate in British society? [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17098.76s)]
*  We've allowed foreign criminal gangs now to dominate London streets. [[04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17103.76s)]
*  It's been going on for years and nobody even dares talk about it. [[04:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17107.76s)]
*  And don't even get me started on the Turkish barbershops. [[04:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17111.76s)]
*  I've been talking about this for some years. [[04:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17115.76s)]
*  I even raised it when I announced that I was going to stand in a general election last year on the 3rd of June. [[04:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17118.76s)]
*  Several in the press corps, I just thought I was off my rocker and they probably still do. [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17124.76s)]
*  But I made the point that these are springing up everywhere. [[04:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17128.76s)]
*  They take cash only. They don't cut anyone's hair. [[04:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17131.76s)]
*  They've all got a Lamborghini parked out the back. [[04:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17134.76s)]
*  Well, I'm pleased to say the National Crime Agency has now raided 300 of these over the course of the last month. [[04:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17137.76s)]
*  And perhaps they should follow my social media a little bit more. [[04:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17143.76s)]
*  Think about this. The Home Secretary has promised that she will, by the end of the year, start to publish the crime statistics. [[04:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17147.76s)]
*  And I hope that she does. I hope she lives up to her word. [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17157.76s)]
*  Because when this has happened in the rest of Europe, it has led to very dramatic political changes with the rise of passes, [[04:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17160.76s)]
*  many of whom we would not ourselves wish to directly associate with. [[04:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17169.76s)]
*  One little example. [[04:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17174.76s)]
*  Denmark allowed in 321 people, Palestinians, a couple of decades ago. [[04:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17176.76s)]
*  And 64% of that number have been convicted of crime. [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17183.76s)]
*  It is stats like that that are fundamentally changing politics across Europe. [[04:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17187.76s)]
*  And in a way that can often be, I think, pretty unhelpful and further widen division. [[04:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17192.76s)]
*  And that division we've seen here too. [[04:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17199.76s)]
*  I'm afraid we've seen, and I predicted this some years ago, the growth of sectarian politics. [[04:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17201.76s)]
*  You know, the four people sit behind me in the chamber, along with Mr Corbyn, but the four are Gaza independence. [[04:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17207.76s)]
*  Their vote is purely on religious lines. [[04:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17215.76s)]
*  Now, I've never seen sectarian politics in my lifetime in England, [[04:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17220.76s)]
*  but I have seen it in Northern Ireland and all the baleful consequences that that led to. [[04:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17225.76s)]
*  I have a feeling that this is an issue that will really start to hurt the Labour Party by the time the next general election comes along, [[04:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17231.76s)]
*  where the Gaza independence will win many, many more seats. [[04:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17239.76s)]
*  Let alone South Asian gangs fighting on the streets of Leicester, [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17244.76s)]
*  or the fact that one million people living here permanently speak little or no English whatsoever. [[04:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17248.76s)]
*  We have to be careful. [[04:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17255.76s)]
*  We've been subjected to lies, lies, lies. [[04:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17257.76s)]
*  Now we're in Dover because it was here in 2020, [[04:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17261.76s)]
*  just as the pandemic was kicking in and lockdown was starting, [[04:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17267.76s)]
*  that I began to go out from this port to film the migrant boats crossing. [[04:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17272.76s)]
*  It was a story that, you know, I mean, sort of Radio Kent would cover it. [[04:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17278.76s)]
*  It was a local story, but a story that nationally wasn't being told. [[04:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17282.76s)]
*  And it was very clear to me in 2020. [[04:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17287.76s)]
*  And I said that frankly, you might as well put up a sign on the white list of Dover. [[04:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17289.76s)]
*  Everyone welcome. [[04:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17294.76s)]
*  And I predicted there would be an invasion. [[04:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17296.76s)]
*  It's a word that got me in very big trouble. [[04:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17298.76s)]
*  But have a look at the numbers that have come. [[04:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17300.76s)]
*  As for this government promising it would smash the gangs, I never believed a word of it. [[04:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17303.76s)]
*  There's as much chance of that working on our current course as there is of smashing the drug gangs, [[04:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17308.76s)]
*  something we've heard from governments for decade after decade, [[04:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17314.76s)]
*  yet Class A proliferates on every street in the country today. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17318.76s)]
*  Labour are doing very, very badly indeed. [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17322.76s)]
*  In fact, year on year, the numbers crossing the channel are 40% up already. [[04:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17326.76s)]
*  And that's before we get the warmer water and the longer clear settle spells of weather. [[04:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17332.76s)]
*  This is a national security emergency. [[04:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17339.76s)]
*  And one of the trends that we've noticed in the last few weeks are now a number of young Palestinians coming in from Gaza. [[04:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17343.76s)]
*  And of course, they claim asylum. [[04:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17352.76s)]
*  They'll be granted asylum. [[04:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17354.76s)]
*  But frankly, letting people in from war zones, young males of fighting age from war zones, [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17356.76s)]
*  when you don't know what their involvement in those areas might have been, is an incredibly dangerous thing to do. [[04:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17362.76s)]
*  And I am the only party leader that has been trusted on legal immigration. [[04:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17369.76s)]
*  I've been arguing it since 2004. [[04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17373.76s)]
*  And on illegal immigration, I've been arguing it since 2020. [[04:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17376.76s)]
*  These local elections on May the 1st, [[04:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17380.76s)]
*  this issue will have a huge impact. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17383.76s)]
*  I will give you but one example this morning, [[04:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17385.76s)]
*  which is a northern constituency called Runcorn and Helsby. [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17388.76s)]
*  There are 750 young men living in that constituency who have crossed the English Channel, 750 of them, [[04:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17393.76s)]
*  just in one constituency. [[04:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17401.76s)]
*  And the big debate and the big press coverage is all about the hotels, [[04:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17403.76s)]
*  something else that I exposed back in 2020. [[04:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17407.76s)]
*  But the hotels, frankly, are the least of the problem. [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17410.76s)]
*  It's the HMOs that are increasingly becoming the issue, the houses of multiple occupancy. [[04:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17412.76s)]
*  And as we've been out and campaigned in that constituency, [[04:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17419.76s)]
*  yes, that house there, there are 10 men living in that house. [[04:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17422.76s)]
*  There are 15 men living in the house around the corner. [[04:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17426.76s)]
*  They loiter all day on the streets. [[04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17429.76s)]
*  They follow our kids to school. [[04:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17432.76s)]
*  We're scared to go out in the evening. [[04:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17433.76s)]
*  These are the impacts. [[04:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17435.76s)]
*  These are the impacts on the lives of a huge number of people in this country. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17437.76s)]
*  And yet Westminster just wants to cock a deafon. [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17442.76s)]
*  It doesn't really want to engage with any of these things. [[04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17446.76s)]
*  The cost just in that constituency alone to local government is £85,000 a day. [[04:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17449.76s)]
*  And it's the same here in Kent and it's the same everywhere. [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17455.76s)]
*  The total cost for housing these people is not all met by national government through taxation. [[04:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17458.76s)]
*  20 to 25% of it has to be met by local authorities. [[04:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17464.76s)]
*  Well, you might say it's all well and good moaning and complaining about the failures of the two so-called main, [[04:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17469.76s)]
*  maybe not for long, political parties. [[04:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17475.76s)]
*  What I've tried to do there is to lay out some statistics over a broad range of issues [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17478.76s)]
*  to show you the extent to which this population explosion has damaged the quality of, [[04:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17483.76s)]
*  I haven't even mentioned the roads, has damaged the quality of life for so many people. [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17488.76s)]
*  So what do we as the most trusted party in this area, what do we intend to do about it? [[04:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17493.76s)]
*  Well, frankly, the whole thing is pretty fruitless unless we leave the European Court of Human Rights [[04:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17500.76s)]
*  and repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act. [[04:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17507.76s)]
*  Every single week we see people, criminals, people who behave terribly, who ought to be deported, [[04:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17512.76s)]
*  but they're not because they claim the right to a family life under Article 8 of the ECHR, [[04:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17519.76s)]
*  something that our own judiciary leans on. [[04:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17525.76s)]
*  I recommit today we must have no more population increase due to net migration. [[04:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17529.76s)]
*  That is something we may have to revisit as the numbers that are leaving Britain is going up pretty alarmingly, [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17535.76s)]
*  as is seen, of course, in the tax receipts from Rachel Reeves' figures in the last few days. [[04:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17542.76s)]
*  We are committed to ending two-tier policing and two-tier justice, [[04:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17548.76s)]
*  and frankly that becomes ever clearer and clearer, particularly since South Port, [[04:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17555.76s)]
*  and it's something that is enraging the silent majority in this country. [[04:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17561.76s)]
*  And we will end all DEI recruitment in the public sector. [[04:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17567.76s)]
*  The fact that 43 police forces now discriminate against white people in favour of ethnic minorities for jobs [[04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17573.76s)]
*  could only divide our country yet further. [[04:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17581.76s)]
*  It's a mistake. We as a political party are colourblind. [[04:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17584.76s)]
*  We couldn't care less what colour you are. We couldn't care less where you come from. [[04:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17588.76s)]
*  We couldn't care less what your religion is. [[04:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17592.76s)]
*  We just ask that if you come here, you work, you pay your taxes, you speak our language, [[04:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17594.76s)]
*  you integrate with us. Of course you can have your own private observance, [[04:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17601.76s)]
*  but that is what we demand of people, and we have to have a meritocratic society. [[04:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17606.76s)]
*  That is the only way, the only way our private companies or our public sector can achieve their best. [[04:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17611.76s)]
*  And we will, we will, of course, reiterate the fact that as an island we have advantages and we need strong borders. [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17618.76s)]
*  But enough of Home Secretary after Home Secretary making promises and dodging issues. [[04:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17627.76s)]
*  This Labour government claim they've increased deportation, but all they've done is to send away visa overstayers [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17633.76s)]
*  and those who are happy to voluntarily return, often with £3,000 in their pocket. [[04:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17641.76s)]
*  We will appoint, we will demand, this government does the same, that there is a minister for deportations. [[04:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17648.76s)]
*  It will be part of the Home Office, but it will be a separate department within it. [[04:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17655.76s)]
*  We will need to recruit new people, as much of the evidence is that those that currently work in the Home Office [[04:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17660.76s)]
*  would willfully obstruct policy if we won the next general election. [[04:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17666.76s)]
*  But somebody somewhere in government needs to be held accountable. [[04:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17671.76s)]
*  And you know, you've only got to go back 20 years to a last Labour government, [[04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17675.76s)]
*  and they were deporting tens of thousands of people a year who were here illegally. [[04:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17680.76s)]
*  When Blunkett was Home Secretary, if you came illegally, you know, you didn't touch the sides, you were sent back. [[04:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17685.76s)]
*  So what I'm calling for isn't actually anything particularly radical. [[04:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17691.76s)]
*  It's actually just common sense. It's what most countries in the world do. [[04:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17695.76s)]
*  You want to go and live there, you want to go and settle there, you have to meet a set of criteria. [[04:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17700.76s)]
*  And that country chooses, are you the right person or are you not? [[04:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17706.76s)]
*  I know the problem is huge because there are an estimated 1.2 million people here illegally. [[04:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17711.76s)]
*  And going beyond the last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job. [[04:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17720.76s)]
*  It's going to be one hell of a battle. [[04:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17726.76s)]
*  And we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us at every point. [[04:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17728.76s)]
*  But it is our intention, ultimately, that if you've come illegally, you should not be able to stay. [[04:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17733.76s)]
*  You should not be able to make a spurious claim that somehow your right to a family life means you should stay here. [[04:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17738.76s)]
*  We will, in three to four weeks' time, announce more detailed policy on how we will actually carry out those deportations. [[04:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17745.76s)]
*  We'll do that after the election, but I make the intention very, very clear here today. [[04:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17756.76s)]
*  We will bring a total end, a total end to all asylum claims from people who've come here on travel visas or who are overseas students. [[04:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17762.76s)]
*  We will demand the deportation of all foreign criminals. [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17774.76s)]
*  And for those who come to Britain and who are granted citizenship, that will be regarded as a legally binding contract, just as it is in Australia and elsewhere. [[04:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17779.76s)]
*  We welcome you in if you make those pledges to us, but you actually have to obey the law and be somebody who is a positive benefit to our country. [[04:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17790.76s)]
*  We are a party who are very proud of the fact we had more votes in the general election from the ethnic minority vote than the Liberal Democrats did. [[04:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17800.76s)]
*  And an increasing number of people from all communities want to stand for our party. [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17810.76s)]
*  These are people who came to Britain or their parents came to Britain because they wanted to be part of this great country. [[04:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17816.76s)]
*  They wanted to become a success in this great country. [[04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17823.76s)]
*  So try, as anyone might, to twist anything I've said today. [[04:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17826.76s)]
*  All I've given you are hard facts. [[04:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17830.76s)]
*  All I've laid out are sensible policies that will stop illegal immigration into Britain and stop the population explosion, which is damaging the quality of life for so many countless millions. [[04:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17832.76s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[04:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17844.76s)]
*  Now we have got a big press list and I will go through it in order. [[04:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17847.76s)]
*  Beginning with Stanley Murphy Johns from the Press Association. [[04:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17852.76s)]
*  So there's no full power between you and the Conservatives. [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17858.76s)]
*  What no full power between us and the party of mass immigration, did you say? [[04:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17866.76s)]
*  So I missed you. [[04:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17870.76s)]
*  But there are rules to unite the right to democracy, so what could that look like? [[04:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17871.76s)]
*  Good old Robert the Remainer. [[04:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17879.76s)]
*  Good old Robert the man who's been on the Damascene Road to Damascus, I mean the Damascene conversion on the road to Damascus. [[04:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17882.76s)]
*  You will see on May the 2nd that our biggest gains are going to be in Labour voting areas. [[04:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17889.76s)]
*  That is where we are making most impact. [[04:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17901.76s)]
*  I would also tell you that the majority of our members and a big percentage of our voters at the last election were not voting Conservative because they loathed the Conservative Party. [[04:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17904.76s)]
*  They could not put up with the level of betrayal that had happened since the 2019 80 seat majority. [[04:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17918.76s)]
*  If we were to even contemplate doing a deal, our voters would be revolted by it. [[04:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17926.76s)]
*  Our party itself internally would be in revolt. [[04:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17936.76s)]
*  And if I wanted to do a deal with you of any kind, I would shake your hand, look you in the eye and do that deal because I trusted you. [[04:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17939.76s)]
*  I don't trust the Conservative Party in any way at all and we are going to replace them. [[04:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17948.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17953.76s)]
*  Next one, Kitty Donaldson from the I-Paper. [[04:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17954.76s)]
*  Just wondering about Birmingham, what would you do if you were in charge of the council there? Would you accept that you would unite? [[04:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17957.76s)]
*  We want to re-industrialise Britain. [[04:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17972.76s)]
*  I worked for 22 years in the metals industry. [[04:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17977.76s)]
*  My clients worked rolling mills. [[04:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17980.76s)]
*  My clients produced lead sheet. [[04:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17982.76s)]
*  My clients manufactured copper wire. [[04:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17984.76s)]
*  These are the people I dealt with on a daily basis working in the metals industry in the city of London. [[04:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17986.76s)]
*  And I've seen nearly all of them go, disappear since 1990. [[04:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17992.76s)]
*  And we boast about the fact we've reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%. [[04:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=17997.76s)]
*  It was no wonder, is it? [[05:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18002.76s)]
*  We've just exported CO2 emissions elsewhere and given ourselves the most expensive energy in the world. [[05:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18003.76s)]
*  To re-industrialise, we have to have a sensible, grown-up relationship with the trade union movement because they're going to be a big part of us re-industrialising Britain. [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18008.76s)]
*  This is not some dramatic U-turn by me or anything like this. [[05:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18017.76s)]
*  It's a practical way of looking at how we do this. [[05:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18021.76s)]
*  As far as Birmingham's concerned, I sense that Birmingham is just the beginning of what is going to be a very, very difficult summer and autumn for the Labour government with the trade union movement. [[05:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18023.76s)]
*  They, of course, virtually own the Labour Party when you think that, you know, Unite have given them 28 million since 2020, the GMB have given them 20 million since 2020. [[05:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18035.76s)]
*  Sorry, other way around, 28, 20, other way around. [[05:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18043.76s)]
*  So they've really funded the Labour Party and they see weakness from the Labour Party. [[05:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18046.76s)]
*  And that, I think, is why we're going to see increasing disputes. [[05:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18051.76s)]
*  Clearly, clearly, as far as Birmingham is concerned, there is a national health hazard. [[05:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18055.76s)]
*  I understand some of the backlog is being cleared up. [[05:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18060.76s)]
*  I think the army was sent in, weren't they? [[05:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18063.76s)]
*  The army was sent in to help with logistics. [[05:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18065.76s)]
*  Well, perhaps they should have been sent in to clear up the rubbish a little bit earlier. [[05:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18068.76s)]
*  I think it was fought on both sides with that. [[05:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18071.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18073.76s)]
*  Katie Harris from the Express. [[05:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18074.76s)]
*  Hiya. [[05:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18077.76s)]
*  Should any changes to both Brexit fishing arrangements be made on France's stuffing small boats? [[05:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18078.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit, and I speak as the only Member of Parliament that has a vested financial interest in a commercial fishing boat, which I do, [[05:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18085.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit there are more foreign boats fishing out here on the Six Mile Line than we've ever seen at any point in previous history. [[05:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18098.76s)]
*  And that goes right the way down to Land's End. [[05:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18110.76s)]
*  The environmental damage to fish stocks in this eastern channel since Brexit has been horrendous. [[05:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18113.76s)]
*  The regulations put by the MMO and the MCA on our own fishing industry are so onerous and so expensive that, frankly, many of them think the situation is worse now than it was before we left the European Union. [[05:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18119.76s)]
*  And any further surrender of our fishing rights will literally finish off what was once a big industry. [[05:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18135.76s)]
*  And it's total and utter madness. [[05:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18142.76s)]
*  The minimum Brexit should have given us is the 12 Mile Line. [[05:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18144.76s)]
*  The maximum, of course, would have been a 200-mile exclusive economic zone, as enjoyed by Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and any normal country in the world. [[05:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18148.76s)]
*  And I worry about that. [[05:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18158.76s)]
*  I worry about alignment with veterinary standards and food standards with the European Union. [[05:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18160.76s)]
*  I worry about alignment for carbon taxes, for example, with the European Union. [[05:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18167.76s)]
*  And I worry perhaps even more that on the 19th of March we're going to be talking about a form of military alignment, [[05:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18173.76s)]
*  which will include intelligence sharing to potentially a very high level that I think could fundamentally damage our relationship with NATO and America. [[05:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18181.76s)]
*  I worry that this Prime Minister, who, after all, is a Remainer, in fact, it is a Remainer Labour Party in a huge way. [[05:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18190.76s)]
*  I worry that he's going to take us so closely back towards alignment with the European Union and maybe even free movement of people for those under 30. [[05:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18198.76s)]
*  I worry about those things because I believe that it damages our ability to do business with the rest of the world. [[05:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18207.76s)]
*  And the bright economic future is not the Eurozone, believe you me. [[05:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18214.76s)]
*  Elizabeth Piper from Reuters. [[05:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18219.76s)]
*  Hello. [[05:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18221.76s)]
*  How are you? [[05:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18223.76s)]
*  Yours is a jolly. [[05:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18225.76s)]
*  It's been northern. [[05:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18227.76s)]
*  The professionalisation of the party, you just said it in your opening remarks that that has now been done. [[05:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18229.76s)]
*  So you're saying that that process is now complete or is there more to do? [[05:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18235.76s)]
*  And how would you answer those members who fear that that process has actually taken the party away from its heart and soul? [[05:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18239.76s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, hundreds of people who applied to be candidates for the county council elections were rejected. [[05:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18246.76s)]
*  Rejected often because of repeated use of words beginning with F and C on social media. [[05:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18259.76s)]
*  And, you know, that might be the way you talk to your mates in the pub. [[05:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18268.76s)]
*  But frankly, you're chucking it out on Facebook or exit really is something that's going to come back, come back and bite you. [[05:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18272.76s)]
*  Others, because they just said things that were just ridiculous, outrageous, embarrassing. [[05:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18278.76s)]
*  So professionalising the party had to be putting in, you know, a vetting system that was as good, if not better than the other parties. [[05:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18283.76s)]
*  And yes, that has upset some people in terms of professionalisation. [[05:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18292.76s)]
*  We've only just started. [[05:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18297.76s)]
*  I mean, the Liberal Democrats won 72 seats. [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18299.76s)]
*  I'm a Liberal Democrats will increase their vote on May the 1st. [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18303.76s)]
*  And much of it at the expense of the Conservative Party, I can tell you, because they're going to lose votes both ways on May the 1st. [[05:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18306.76s)]
*  But they've got a phenomenal thriving branch structure. [[05:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18312.76s)]
*  And so much of successful politics is about the social element of politics, whether it was in the part of the world you come from, the working man's club up north where the Labour Party was very strong. [[05:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18316.76s)]
*  Or whether it's, you know, the more genteel garden party of the Conservative, the Conservative Association in the south of England. [[05:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18327.76s)]
*  And we've not yet been able to build those social interactions between people. [[05:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18336.76s)]
*  And that is something else we have to do. [[05:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18342.76s)]
*  We have to train them how to raise money, etc. [[05:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18344.76s)]
*  All I would say to you is I think in the last 10 months, we've made incredible strides forward. [[05:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18346.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have done it without Zia and people like Zia with me and a very young, professional, dedicated team who even worked on Christmas Day. [[05:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18351.76s)]
*  So it's a work in progress. [[05:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18359.76s)]
*  But I would say to you that we've made enormous, enormous strides forward. [[05:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18362.76s)]
*  And one of the reasons we need to win a really good number of council seats is, you know, we can build teams of people around elected councillors. [[05:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18366.76s)]
*  I also said I would democratise the party. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18375.76s)]
*  You know, I put in place a new constitution that was passed by the conference. [[05:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18379.76s)]
*  I've given away my two thirds ownership of the shares of the party. [[05:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18384.76s)]
*  And we have a board with 50% elected representation that comes in over the course of this summer. [[05:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18388.76s)]
*  So I feel I've kept my promise to the members. [[05:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18395.76s)]
*  You know, there are some in every organisation that will moan. [[05:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18397.76s)]
*  But we've gone through 225,000 members this morning. [[05:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18400.76s)]
*  And for those that want to drag me into a political direction that perhaps some of the political parties in Europe are at or are headed to, [[05:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18404.76s)]
*  then you know what? [[05:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18418.76s)]
*  I'm not for budging. I'm not for shifting. [[05:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18420.76s)]
*  I've always said this will be a non-sectarian, non-racist political party. [[05:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18422.76s)]
*  That's how it was founded. That's what it'll be. [[05:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18426.76s)]
*  I don't get budged on that, not even by very, very rich men who own motorcar companies. [[05:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18429.76s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[05:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18434.76s)]
*  Next up, Daniel Ryanesson from the Kent Messenger Group. [[05:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18436.76s)]
*  Daniel. [[05:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18440.76s)]
*  Morning. Is reform going to win Kent Council election next week? [[05:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18441.76s)]
*  And if so, what's the first thing we'll do? [[05:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18444.76s)]
*  That is a really hard question. [[05:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18446.76s)]
*  I don't know is the honest answer. I don't know. [[05:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18448.76s)]
*  I sense the Labour vote. [[05:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18451.76s)]
*  I mean, don't forget, Kent's now got 11 Labour MPs. [[05:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18455.76s)]
*  11 Labour MPs and one Lib Dem in Tunbridge, Wales. [[05:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18458.76s)]
*  The politics of Kent, you know, as it did back in 97, of course, there was a massive swing from all blue to half blue, half red in 97. [[05:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18461.76s)]
*  It's been even more dramatic this time. [[05:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18470.76s)]
*  We are going to do very, very well indeed. [[05:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18472.76s)]
*  We are going to win a lot of seats on Kent County Council. [[05:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18475.76s)]
*  Can we win an outright majority? [[05:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18478.76s)]
*  I simply, honestly, truthfully just don't know. [[05:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18480.76s)]
*  But that's what we're aiming for. [[05:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18484.76s)]
*  And if we were to succeed, what's the first thing we would do? [[05:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18486.76s)]
*  Bring in the auditors. [[05:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18490.76s)]
*  Why did they spend? [[05:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18493.76s)]
*  Why did they lose 60 million quid on a high risk stock market fund? [[05:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18495.76s)]
*  Well, you might as well put it on the 330 at Newmarket. [[05:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18501.76s)]
*  And bear in mind, this is the same Kent County Council who lost over 50 million with a bank in Iceland that was paying 8 percent interest rates. [[05:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18505.76s)]
*  And everybody else was paying 4. [[05:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18515.76s)]
*  I mean, you'd have thought maybe they'd have learned their lesson. [[05:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18516.76s)]
*  That's just one little example of what we believe to be gross financial mismanagement. [[05:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18519.76s)]
*  They're in a hell of a financial hole. [[05:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18525.76s)]
*  Seven hundred and twenty million pound accumulated debt. [[05:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18528.76s)]
*  Daily interest repayments of 85,000 pounds a day. [[05:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18532.76s)]
*  And all right, we know it's not easy. [[05:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18536.76s)]
*  You know, we know less money comes from central government. [[05:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18537.76s)]
*  We know that social care costs rise with an aging population. [[05:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18539.76s)]
*  We understand that successive lockdowns did damage the minds of quite a lot of young people. [[05:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18543.76s)]
*  So send needs are higher. [[05:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18548.76s)]
*  I'm not saying we can wave a magic wand, but can we put the thing under better management rather than I think the very complacent control it's had under the Conservatives over these last decades? [[05:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18549.76s)]
*  I believe we can. [[05:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18560.76s)]
*  Kent County Council is broken. [[05:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18562.76s)]
*  Reform are going to come along and fix it. [[05:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18563.76s)]
*  Let's go to Amy Rogers from The Telegraph, please. [[05:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18566.76s)]
*  Hi, thanks, Nigel. [[05:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18569.76s)]
*  You've said you've got no intention of forming coalitions with the Tories at any level. [[05:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18570.76s)]
*  Does that mean you're ruling out Tory reform coalitions or power sharing arrangements at council level after the election? [[05:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18575.76s)]
*  Or could you work with the Tories and local governments? [[05:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18581.76s)]
*  We can work with anybody at local government. [[05:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18584.76s)]
*  We can work with independents. [[05:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18585.76s)]
*  We can work with Labour. [[05:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18586.76s)]
*  We can work with Lib Dems. [[05:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18588.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, if we're in that, I mean, you know, if getting back to the question from the Kent Messenger Group, you know, if we're in that position, we would work with other people. [[05:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18589.76s)]
*  But our demands are that we bring the auditors in. [[05:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18598.76s)]
*  We have a look at what long term contracts have been signed. [[05:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18603.76s)]
*  We have a look at why so much money is being spent on consultants. [[05:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18607.76s)]
*  We have a look at why in some cases up to 10 million pounds a year are being spent on agency workers by county councils across this country. [[05:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18611.76s)]
*  We have a look at who the pothole contracts are with. [[05:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18621.76s)]
*  And if they were failing providers, why they signed up for five years or in one case, I know of 10 years. [[05:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18624.76s)]
*  So if we had people who agree that it's not the job of county councils to spend millions after millions on climate change, it's not the job of county councils to spend huge amounts of money on D.I. [[05:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18629.76s)]
*  But those areas like consultancies, those areas like massive bills for agency workers, I mean, you know, you might need agency workers in a short term emergency. [[05:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18640.76s)]
*  But why you're spending millions year after year, some of them are, I don't know. [[05:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18651.76s)]
*  So we would work with other people, you know, if we were able to achieve those objectives. [[05:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18655.76s)]
*  And that, I think, is what our voters would want and would demand of us. [[05:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18660.76s)]
*  Charlotte Wright from the BBC, although we'll do it face to face later, I guess. [[05:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18666.76s)]
*  Yes, Harry. [[05:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18670.76s)]
*  So you're here as part of the local elections campaign here in Kent. [[05:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18671.76s)]
*  What powers would reform county councillors have to do anything differently when it comes to dealing with immigration? [[05:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18675.76s)]
*  Well, they could complain. [[05:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18682.76s)]
*  I mean, that's one thing they could do. [[05:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18684.76s)]
*  They could outright refuse to have migrant hotels or HMOs imposed upon them. [[05:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18686.76s)]
*  They could be damn difficult. [[05:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18691.76s)]
*  And actually, what you've seen in Parliament over the last five years, you know, individual cases, I mean, pretty Patel's constituency, you know, migrant hotel was put in pretty constituency. [[05:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18692.76s)]
*  I turned up with an iPhone, filmed it all. [[05:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18702.76s)]
*  And the next day, the hotel was closed down and moved to a different constituency. [[05:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18705.76s)]
*  So you do get MPs who are able already, you know, if they're in a position of power to perhaps ease things for their constituents, that's what we could do. [[05:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18708.76s)]
*  But, you know, there is an enormous burden from all of this. [[05:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18716.76s)]
*  But what a Kent County Council can do, you know, is, as I say, find out who the road contractor deals with, what they're costing, why they're so ineffective. [[05:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18719.76s)]
*  You know, why is all this money being spent on wellness? [[05:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18729.76s)]
*  And I just think County Councils, you know, we know what the basic job of a County Council is. [[05:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18732.76s)]
*  I think they've extended way beyond that remit. [[05:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18737.76s)]
*  OK, moving on. [[05:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18741.76s)]
*  William John Russell from Reuters and other Reuters. [[05:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18743.76s)]
*  Oh, he's on camera. [[05:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18745.76s)]
*  Fine. OK. [[05:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18748.76s)]
*  Emine Shemaz from The Guardian. [[05:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18749.76s)]
*  William. [[05:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18752.76s)]
*  Hi. [[05:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18753.76s)]
*  So the pollster Lord Cable just predicted that you would go to between 400 and 400 disease next week. [[05:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18754.76s)]
*  I'll buy him lunch if he's right. [[05:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18760.76s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think that's realistic? [[05:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18762.76s)]
*  And would you count that as a win? [[05:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18763.76s)]
*  I'll buy him a big lunch if he's right. [[05:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18765.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[05:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18767.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[05:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18768.76s)]
*  I came into this campaign. [[05:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18769.76s)]
*  Obviously, we're very, very upset that Essex, that Suffolk, that Norfolk, that East Sussex, West Sussex, Hampshire, Isle of Wight. [[05:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18770.76s)]
*  I'm running out now. [[05:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18782.76s)]
*  There's probably other ones there somewhere. [[05:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18783.76s)]
*  The fact that five and a half million, oh, sorry, sorry. [[05:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18784.76s)]
*  The fact that five and a half million people have been denied their vote in what was some of our very strongest counties, we're very, very angry about. [[05:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18786.76s)]
*  And there's no argument for it. [[05:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18795.76s)]
*  You know, Angela Rainer's so-called devolution of local government applies equally to Kent as it does to Essex. [[05:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18796.76s)]
*  And yet this side of the estuary are voting and that side are not. [[05:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18802.76s)]
*  So I said at the start of the campaign, my aim, my goal, my ambition was to win 200 county council or unitary equivalent seats. [[05:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18806.76s)]
*  That was my aim. [[05:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18814.76s)]
*  The other aim, of course, has been to take on labor in Runcorn and Helsby, which is, I understand, their 16th safest seat in Britain and to run them close. [[05:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18815.76s)]
*  That was another aim that I set for me the first. [[05:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18825.76s)]
*  Let me tell you, we are running them close in Runcorn and Helsby. [[05:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18828.76s)]
*  In fact, I don't know. [[05:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18832.76s)]
*  We might even be doing a touch better than that. [[05:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18833.76s)]
*  There's still a week to go. [[05:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18835.76s)]
*  If Heywood is right, if we win that number of seats, then that will be quite a political revolution. [[05:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18836.76s)]
*  We will have to see. [[05:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18842.76s)]
*  Not long to wait now. [[05:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18845.76s)]
*  Emma Core from Global. [[05:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18847.76s)]
*  What do you make of the row where they're Dane Andrew James eligible to run as a reformed mayor in Lincolnshire? [[05:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18848.76s)]
*  She's living in Yorkshire, isn't she? [[05:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18855.76s)]
*  Not within the region as per the rules. [[05:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18857.76s)]
*  Have you sorted this out? [[05:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18859.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Conservative candidate in Cambridge is not living within the constituency either. [[05:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18861.76s)]
*  So I think this is not something that's uncommon. [[05:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18865.76s)]
*  Andrea has got accommodation in Lincoln. [[05:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18867.76s)]
*  She's born and bred in Lincolnshire. [[05:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18870.76s)]
*  She was a county councillor for Boston. [[05:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18872.76s)]
*  Her grandfather was a fisherman in Grimsby. [[05:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18874.76s)]
*  Her links with Lincolnshire are pretty clear and strong. [[05:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18876.76s)]
*  She did win a surprise election in Leeds when she beat the dancing star and star of breakfast TV now. [[05:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18879.76s)]
*  So unsurprisingly, she got a property in that constituency. [[05:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18890.76s)]
*  The one factor here that is difficult is that there is a seven year old boy who has quite severe educational learning difficulties. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18896.76s)]
*  And she said, look, if she's elected as mayor of greater Lincolnshire, she will find the right school for him near Lincoln. [[05:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18906.76s)]
*  That's not something you can do literally overnight. [[05:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18916.76s)]
*  So, you know, she's living between the two. [[05:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18919.76s)]
*  That is a fact. [[05:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18922.76s)]
*  The fact is really quite vexatious complaints being put in. [[05:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18923.76s)]
*  Let me tell you this. [[05:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18927.76s)]
*  If they say that Andrea has broken the rules on Friday tomorrow at this hearing, do you know what it'll mean? [[05:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18928.76s)]
*  It'll mean the entire mayoral election is rerun. [[05:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18935.76s)]
*  It won't mean just that she's disqualified. [[05:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18940.76s)]
*  The whole thing will have to be rerun. [[05:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18942.76s)]
*  And I don't think the voters of Lincolnshire would like that very much. [[05:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18944.76s)]
*  So I expect tomorrow we get a common sense judgment that is based around the fact her situation and she's a single mum now. [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18947.76s)]
*  Her situation with a seven year old boy with bad learning difficulties explains to some extent why she is where she is. [[05:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18955.76s)]
*  All right. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18963.76s)]
*  We will find out tomorrow morning. [[05:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18964.76s)]
*  Who was we? [[05:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18966.76s)]
*  We got Noah Hoffman from The Sun. [[05:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18967.76s)]
*  Hello. [[05:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18969.76s)]
*  Nigel, how would you ensure you talk about discriminating and making sure to right... [[05:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18971.76s)]
*  Choosing. [[05:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18976.76s)]
*  Choosing right migrants if they're highly skilled come to the UK. [[05:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18977.76s)]
*  To stop this concerning trend of sectarian politics that we see in the comments and just generally in sort of local areas, [[05:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18982.76s)]
*  how would you ensure that any new migrants have British values and are very determined to integrate where some have not? [[05:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18990.76s)]
*  Well, I think one of the big cons with this and one of the reasons that major problems have built up in some of our inner cities and northern towns in particular [[05:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=18999.76s)]
*  is because of this family reunion policy. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19008.76s)]
*  Well, you know, somebody comes in as a low school worker, let's say for argument's sake, might work for a bit, might then be on benefits, [[05:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19011.76s)]
*  is then allowed to bring extended family from wherever it may be. [[05:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19018.76s)]
*  They come in, they don't learn the language, they fail at school. [[05:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19021.76s)]
*  They become part of that welfare system. [[05:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19027.76s)]
*  And I think it's within that environment, it's within that environment that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive. [[05:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19030.76s)]
*  So I think we have to be much, much more rigorous about family reunion, which of course makes up such a large number of those that have come to Britain. [[05:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19037.76s)]
*  And, you know, some will say that's tough, that's unfair, but look what the result of it has been. [[05:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19045.76s)]
*  It certainly hasn't been a positive one. [[05:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19049.76s)]
*  OK, we've got Camilla from the Daily Express. [[05:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19052.76s)]
*  That's the end of the video. [[05:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19057.76s)]
*  You're the end of the video, right. Whoever gave me this list is in for a bit of a talking to. [[05:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19060.76s)]
*  OK, who else have we got? We've got Joshua from Bauer Media Group. [[05:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19068.76s)]
*  Hello, Nigel. You mentioned about the rising set needs and strays that can't be in development services in Logan. [[05:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19072.76s)]
*  It's an issue that impacts parents in this country, parents in this county, and parents across the country. [[05:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19078.76s)]
*  What needs to be done to make sure that parents are supported and that just to ease the burden that they currently feel? [[05:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19083.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a massive problem. I have to say for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed, with a high level of benefits, [[05:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19089.76s)]
*  you're telling people aged 18 that they're victims. [[05:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19107.76s)]
*  And if you are told you're a victim and you think you're a victim, you are very likely to stay as a victim. [[05:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19110.76s)]
*  And so many of these diagnoses, you know, for SEND before 18, for disability register after 18, [[05:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19120.76s)]
*  so many of these have been conducted on Zoom with the family GP. [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19128.76s)]
*  I think that is a massive mistake. I think if you're, you know, if I'm your family GP and I've known your family for generations and you're saying to me, [[05:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19136.76s)]
*  and you're saying to me, Doc, there's a real problem here with depression or whatever it may be. [[05:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19149.76s)]
*  It's quite hard for me as your GP to say no. [[05:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19154.76s)]
*  So I don't think any, I don't think any of these allocations should be done by family GPs and that should be done independently. [[05:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19158.76s)]
*  And I think we are massively, I'm not being heartless here, I'm being frank. [[05:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19166.76s)]
*  I think we are massively over diagnosing those with mental illness problems, those with other general behavioral disabilities. [[05:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19172.76s)]
*  And I think we're creating a class of victims in Britain who will struggle ever to get out of it. [[05:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19183.76s)]
*  And that's not good for them. And it's not good for us. So I worry about those things. [[05:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19188.76s)]
*  I do accept, though, I do accept that repeated lockdowns, particularly the third lockdown, were probably the biggest mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country. [[05:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19193.76s)]
*  And they have caused great long term harm. [[05:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19205.76s)]
*  OK, and lastly here, before I do some one to ones with broadcast, Emma Core from LBC. [[05:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19208.76s)]
*  OK, we are sorry, I apologize. We are done and dusted. Sorry. [[05:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19217.76s)]
*  I just wanted to ask, we've got an article on the website today about multiculturalism and how it's failed in Britain. [[05:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19223.76s)]
*  I wanted to ask, do you think multiculturalism is dead now in this country and if so, why? [[05:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19233.76s)]
*  Sadly, I think multiculturalism is alive and well. That's why we've got the growth of sectarian politics. [[05:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19239.76s)]
*  And that's why we got people marching on the streets of London. [[05:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19244.76s)]
*  It's what we had the provocation against the Jewish community that took place in South End last weekend. [[05:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19248.76s)]
*  I mean, had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country, you know, the long arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very, very quickly. [[05:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19255.76s)]
*  I think what has changed is the national narrative, the national narrative that multiculturalism is good. [[05:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19267.76s)]
*  The encouragement by a Labour Party in particular, you know, please, let's put you all in separate little boxes. [[05:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19275.76s)]
*  Let's have identity politics on a massive scale. [[05:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19282.76s)]
*  I think that and I think the realization of what a huge error that was has been exposed, probably best by Trevor Phillips, you know, who was head of the Equalities and Human Rights Committee. [[05:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19285.76s)]
*  Who recognizes that actually encouraging difference was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness, whatever differences our backgrounds may be. [[05:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19296.76s)]
*  So that's the direction that we firmly want to go in. [[05:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19309.76s)]
*  We need to have a shared culture. [[05:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19312.76s)]
*  And that's the danger of allowing a lot of people into a country with whom you have no shared history, with whom you have no shared history. [[05:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19316.76s)]
*  With whom you have no shared culture, with whom you have little in common. [[05:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19324.76s)]
*  And I'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that mattered. [[05:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19329.76s)]
*  But now we know it matters and the narrative has changed. [[05:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19333.76s)]
*  The reality as yet has not. [[05:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19337.76s)]
*  Let's hope very soon it does. [[05:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19340.76s)]
*  Thank you very Adam. [[05:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19342.76s)]
*  I can do it now or face to face. [[05:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19344.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19346.76s)]
*  So you call for a UK Doge cutting the size of the state. [[05:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19348.76s)]
*  But now you're also calling for a new minister of deportation. [[05:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19352.76s)]
*  You're not making the Home Office even bigger. [[05:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19355.76s)]
*  Yes, but compared to the cost of seven billion pounds a year of dealing with what's coming over the English Channel, if we can put a stop to that, it'll save a lot of money very, very quickly indeed. [[05:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19357.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19369.76s)]
*  Sorry. Yeah. [[05:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19371.76s)]
*  Again, I was going to face to face on camera, but. [[05:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19372.76s)]
*  This one here. [[05:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19374.76s)]
*  Richard Sice wrote that Robert Jennings just in the wrong part. [[05:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19376.76s)]
*  I say, well, Richard is right. [[05:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19381.76s)]
*  You know, I mean, I reckon at least 50 of the conservative MPs ought to be in the Liberal Democrats. [[05:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19383.76s)]
*  I reckon about 21 of the Tory MPs ought to be in reform. [[05:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19389.76s)]
*  I'm not sure which I'm not sure whether I'm not even sure whether Jennings is one of them. [[05:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19394.76s)]
*  Maybe he is. [[05:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19398.76s)]
*  Maybe he's genuine. [[05:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19399.76s)]
*  Maybe he really has been on this Damascene conversion. [[05:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19400.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[05:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19403.76s)]
*  And I have to say, I thought in the leadership contest, he was a bit like a Nigel Farage impersonator. [[05:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19404.76s)]
*  And I had a chat with him in the gallery in the voting lobby shortly after. [[05:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19409.76s)]
*  I said, well, look, mate, you know, if you want some lessons in getting a personality, I mean, I'm your man. [[05:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19413.76s)]
*  You know, I can help you. [[05:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19417.76s)]
*  So I don't know. [[05:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19419.76s)]
*  But I think I mean, more seriously, I think. [[05:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19420.76s)]
*  You know, can we bad knocks problem is twofold. [[05:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19424.76s)]
*  Number one, if she criticizes what's happening in the English Channel, if she criticizes mass migration, [[05:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19429.76s)]
*  if she criticizes high taxation, if she criticizes the increasing size of the state, [[05:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19435.76s)]
*  if she criticizes the hugely increasing debt burden, well, what did you do for the last 14 years? [[05:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19440.76s)]
*  I mean, it's the same with the grooming gangs. [[05:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19447.76s)]
*  Where was she as Minister for Women? [[05:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19450.76s)]
*  Two years she was Minister for Women. [[05:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19453.76s)]
*  Didn't mention grooming gangs once that I can see. [[05:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19454.76s)]
*  So one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past. [[05:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19457.76s)]
*  And I think there are many voters. [[05:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19461.76s)]
*  You know, you can talk red wall, but the parts of Kent here that, you know, when conservative in 2019, that vote's not coming back. [[05:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19463.76s)]
*  That's one problem they've got. [[05:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19470.76s)]
*  The second problem they've got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for. [[05:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19471.76s)]
*  And I think what you're going to see on May the 1st is a lot of conservative voters coming to us, [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19478.76s)]
*  but equally quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of the Liberal Democrats. [[05:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19484.76s)]
*  And that, you know, and they may have been around for 195 years, [[05:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19491.76s)]
*  just as the liberals were the natural party of government until the Labour Party came along in 1918. [[05:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19496.76s)]
*  And I think we are potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics [[05:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19502.76s)]
*  where an established party that's been a party of government no longer serves any purpose. [[05:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19510.76s)]
*  And it goes back to the earlier questions that I was asked by the Press Association about, you know, do I want to do deals, et cetera? [[05:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19515.76s)]
*  No, our aim is to replace the Conservative Party as the party of opposition to this Labour government. [[05:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19523.76s)]
*  And that is what we're going to try and do. [[05:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19529.76s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much, everybody. [[05:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19531.76s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. [[05:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19534.76s)]
*  How fortunate I've been or perhaps it was just good judgment in picking Zia as party chairman, [[05:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19536.76s)]
*  because the big thing we had to do after the last general election was to professionalize the party. [[05:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19542.76s)]
*  And we've done that. [[05:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19548.76s)]
*  And I'm very proud of the fact we've managed to put more candidates in the field for May the 1st than any other party. [[05:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19549.76s)]
*  But today I wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue [[05:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19555.76s)]
*  and one that perhaps doesn't impact on the May the 1st elections. [[05:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19560.76s)]
*  But you would be wrong. [[05:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19564.76s)]
*  Indeed, the population explosion that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect on the lives of more people than any other single issue. [[05:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19566.76s)]
*  And it's interesting because up until 1997, this wasn't even a political debate. [[05:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19577.76s)]
*  Indeed, when I was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999, immigration didn't appear in my election literature or a manifesto at all. [[05:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19584.76s)]
*  And that's because simply from when rush right up until Mr Blair became prime minister, [[05:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19594.76s)]
*  net migration into Britain had run an average of 30 to 50 thousand people a year, sometimes higher, sometimes lower. [[05:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19599.76s)]
*  It wasn't even a debate in successive general elections. [[05:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19609.76s)]
*  But the Labour Party under Blair decided that diversity was a good thing, something that was never ever to be questioned. [[05:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19614.76s)]
*  And that mass immigration would be good for the economy, would make us all better off. [[05:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19622.76s)]
*  And frankly, anybody that dared to even question this up until at least 2010 was considered completely and utterly beyond the pale, the worst of the worst. [[05:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19628.76s)]
*  And I know this because I first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 when it became pretty obvious to me that opening up the door to eight and then 10 former communist countries, [[05:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19641.76s)]
*  some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size of ours, would lead to a huge inflow of people. [[05:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19654.76s)]
*  Although at least in those days, people that came did actually work. [[05:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19661.76s)]
*  That sadly has now all changed. [[05:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19665.76s)]
*  And since then, in every single general election, we have been made a series of promises that frankly amount to little more than a pack of lies. [[05:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19669.76s)]
*  The public being told what the parties think the public want to hear, in fact, know from polling what the public want to hear without any intention of delivering on it at all. [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19680.76s)]
*  Of course, the Conservatives far worse than Tony Blair. [[05:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19692.76s)]
*  Net migration to tens of thousands promised in 2010, 2015, 2017 and then 2019. [[05:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19695.76s)]
*  We were told substantially lower numbers. [[05:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19702.76s)]
*  We now have a Labour government who promised they will radically bring down the numbers coming into Britain and we'll find out in June when we get the first data, whether that's true or the way very much doubt it. [[05:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19705.76s)]
*  We've been told by successive prime ministers they would stop the boats, even that they would smash the gangs. [[05:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19718.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid none of it has come true. [[05:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19725.76s)]
*  And I think it's about time we looked at the true cost of the population explosion to this country. [[05:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19728.76s)]
*  And I want to make this point very clear that recent polling, particularly polling that was published last week in the Sun newspaper, which was the whole of the Midlands of the North showed that we are now by far the most trusted party on this issue and that I am by far the most trusted leader to do something about it. [[05:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19735.76s)]
*  It'll be good for the economy is what we were told. [[05:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19757.76s)]
*  Well, 30 years ago, 7% of the workforce were foreign born today. [[05:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19760.76s)]
*  21% of the workforce are foreign born. [[05:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19764.76s)]
*  That has directly led to a pay cut on average of about 3% per worker, which, of course, doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money. [[05:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19768.76s)]
*  But if you're earning 20,000 pounds a year, it does mean quite a lot. [[05:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19777.76s)]
*  And interestingly, the Bank of England in 2015 produced a report showing a direct link between numbers of foreign born workers and wage suppression. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19781.76s)]
*  Yet the whole thing was completely and utterly covered up. [[05:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19791.76s)]
*  The impact, of course, on wages is worse than that, given that there are 500,000 700,000 who knows people working in the illegal economy, leading to further wage suppression. [[05:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19795.76s)]
*  The greatest myth, of course, is that it will be good for us. [[05:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19809.76s)]
*  And you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here has come to work. [[05:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19813.76s)]
*  Well, try this statistic for size. [[05:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19817.76s)]
*  Foreign born workers are 40% higher likely to be unemployed than British born workers. [[05:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19820.76s)]
*  40% higher for foreign born people to be on the unemployment register. [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19829.76s)]
*  It's not a statistic I'd ever heard before. [[05:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19835.76s)]
*  It's pretty mind blowing. [[05:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19837.76s)]
*  And even the argument that, look, most people come here to work. [[05:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19839.76s)]
*  So what is there to complain about? [[05:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19843.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid that doesn't work either because in the last six years, net three million people have settled in Britain from outside of Europe. [[05:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19845.76s)]
*  And of those, only 16% came on work visas. [[05:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19855.76s)]
*  It's completely mind blowing number. [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19859.76s)]
*  Now it's true to say that many of those who've come perhaps will enter the workforce. [[05:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19862.76s)]
*  But you begin to understand that the argument for mass migration that is needed for the labor market actually isn't true. [[05:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19867.76s)]
*  Well, the majority that come, come as dependents. [[05:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19874.76s)]
*  The Center for Migration Studies recently published that since 2020, unemployment benefits to foreign born people have been 36 billion pounds. [[05:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19878.76s)]
*  We are talking simply about eye watering numbers. [[05:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19888.76s)]
*  The other statistic that I was surprised by was that low paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer 150,000 pounds by the time they reach retirement, let alone what that will be afterwards. [[05:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19893.76s)]
*  So let us be clear. [[05:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19906.76s)]
*  Non selective, in many case, non working mass migration into Britain has made everybody in this country poorer, except, of course, for big employers who love as much cheap migrant foreign labor as they can possibly get their hands on. [[05:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19908.76s)]
*  As the argument grows every year that British people simply won't do those jobs. [[05:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19926.76s)]
*  But we're told it's OK because we're growing. [[05:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19934.76s)]
*  We're getting richer. [[05:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19937.76s)]
*  Gross domestic products is going up. [[05:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19939.76s)]
*  And that's the only measure that anybody on the two front benches in Parliament will ever talk about. [[05:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19942.76s)]
*  I did try the other day with Rachel Reeves and she's trying to. [[05:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19948.76s)]
*  But I did try to make the argument that actually GDP in gross figures doesn't mean very much when you have a population that's rising by three quarters of a million or a million every year directly as a result of open borders. [[05:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19952.76s)]
*  Why not look at GDP per capita? [[05:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19967.76s)]
*  But no, nobody wants to engage with that. [[05:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19970.76s)]
*  Nobody wants to engage with that. [[05:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19972.76s)]
*  Well, the last two years have seen record levels of migration into Britain and GDP per capita has fallen in six of the last eight quarters. [[05:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19973.76s)]
*  We are getting poorer as a result of policies started by the Labour Party, accelerated by the Conservative Party and now being continued by Labour, none of which, of course, means that we in this country don't want high skilled, [[05:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=19984.76s)]
*  law abiding people to come into Britain to work, pay taxes, add to our society. [[05:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20000.76s)]
*  All of those things are good. [[05:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20005.76s)]
*  But we have to we have to discriminate. [[05:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20008.76s)]
*  Yes, that's that's the word I'm going to use. [[05:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20011.76s)]
*  It means choose. [[05:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20012.76s)]
*  We have to discriminate in terms of who comes into our country and in what numbers to try and have a rational debate about housing is virtually impossible. [[05:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20014.76s)]
*  I've been trying for over 10 years to engage other party leaders in a rational debate about the terrible housing shortage, the cost of housing and rents in this country. [[05:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20026.76s)]
*  Nobody will engage with me. [[05:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20035.76s)]
*  Of the house price rises that we've had over the last two decades, 25 percent of that is directly down to immigration and the rising population. [[05:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20039.76s)]
*  Indeed, even the Ministry of Housing themselves said in 2018 again, suppressed, not publicized, that a one percent increase in the number of households leads to a two percent increase in cost. [[05:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20050.76s)]
*  And just think on this. [[05:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20064.76s)]
*  There were twenty three point seven million households when Mr. Blair came to power. [[05:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20066.76s)]
*  There are now twenty eight point five million households. [[05:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20070.76s)]
*  Net migration has increased the population by ten million in the last 20 years. [[05:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20075.76s)]
*  And the same goes for rent. [[05:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20081.76s)]
*  Even in recent years, a third of rent rises since 2020 are directly down to rising population, which means for the average renter, another thousand pounds a year. [[05:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20083.76s)]
*  And think on this. [[05:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20095.76s)]
*  This government is determined to build one and a half million new homes in the lifetime of this parliament, just as the government before was committed to the same figure. [[05:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20097.76s)]
*  That will not have any impact on the housing crisis in Britain in any way at all. [[05:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20106.76s)]
*  We currently have to build a new house every two minutes. [[05:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20113.76s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[05:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20117.76s)]
*  We have to build one new house every two minutes just to cope with levels of net migration into Britain. [[05:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20118.76s)]
*  Not dealing at all with the backlog that we built up. [[05:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20126.76s)]
*  And perhaps one of the areas that is causing the most angst is social housing. [[05:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20130.76s)]
*  And we know we do have a shortage of social housing stock in our country. [[05:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20135.76s)]
*  But somebody who comes into the Port of Dover, a young man without any documents who's come from goodness knows where, who believes in who knows what. [[05:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20140.76s)]
*  Once they once they give an indefinite leave to remain, and we increasingly do that because we find it too difficult to deport anybody anywhere, they then effectively are homeless, which means, of course, they go straight to the top of the of the social housing list. [[05:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20148.76s)]
*  It's happening in every county. [[05:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20163.76s)]
*  Just one example. [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20165.76s)]
*  Northumberland last year, hundreds of asylum seekers have been given indefinite leave to remain, went straight to the top of the housing queue, whilst there were 14,000 people, families on the list who were put, I'm afraid, to the back. [[05:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20166.76s)]
*  That's just one county example, but it's happening literally everywhere. [[05:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20180.76s)]
*  But it's OK. [[05:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20184.76s)]
*  We're told we wouldn't be able to have a National Health Service if it wasn't for increasing net migration into Britain. [[05:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20185.76s)]
*  That is what we've been told over and over and over. [[05:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20191.76s)]
*  And you'll still hear those arguments on BBC Question Time pretty much every week. [[05:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20193.76s)]
*  We need foreign doctors and nurses. [[05:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20199.76s)]
*  Well, I would put a different argument to you. [[05:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20201.76s)]
*  I would say we should probably be ashamed of ourselves for taking over 100,000 doctors and nurses from the Red List, from underdeveloped countries where undoubtedly those medical experts are needed even more than they're needed here. [[05:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20203.76s)]
*  Amazingly thing, 100,000 workers in 25 years coming from countries that need them more than us. [[05:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20220.76s)]
*  And yet, right at the moment, we only have nine and a half thousand people in medical training of any kind at all. [[05:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20225.76s)]
*  It's almost as if the NHS is happier to take on agency staff from West Africa. [[05:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20232.76s)]
*  And we've sort of lost the idea that we should be training enough of our own doctors and nurses. [[05:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20238.76s)]
*  And perhaps one of the biggest political issues in Britain that affects people's lives is access to a GP appointment, something that we pretty much took as a birthright, to be honest. [[05:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20244.76s)]
*  Well, have a think about this. [[05:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20254.76s)]
*  Seven point two million foreign born people have registered with GPs in the last 10 years. [[05:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20256.76s)]
*  And you're surprised you can't get an NHS appointment. [[05:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20264.76s)]
*  All I'm doing here is giving you cold, hard facts, all of which I can back up if you want further documentation. [[05:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20269.76s)]
*  I'm telling you the truth about the terrible, terrible mistakes that have been made by both of our so-called main parties. [[05:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20278.76s)]
*  And one that is very difficult to talk about, because you're always told that you're scapegoating, you're saying something that is truly beastly, is crime. [[05:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20285.76s)]
*  Mass immigration has increased crime in this country. [[05:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20294.76s)]
*  In actually quite a dramatic way. [[05:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20298.76s)]
*  Foreign born nationals are 71% more likely to be convicted of sexual assault. [[05:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20301.76s)]
*  69% more likely to be convicted of drug offenses. [[05:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20308.76s)]
*  39% more likely to be convicted of any kind of crime. [[05:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20313.76s)]
*  One in 50 Albanians in Britain is in jail. [[05:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20319.76s)]
*  Now what does that tell you? [[05:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20323.76s)]
*  Does it tell you that the whole of Albania is rotten, that they're all awful? No. [[05:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20325.76s)]
*  What it tells you is if you come from a poorer country, there are richer pickings in crime in London and Birmingham and Manchester, and frankly even Dover, than there are where you come from. [[05:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20328.76s)]
*  It's why I return to my point. [[05:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20340.76s)]
*  We must discriminate when it comes to who can come into our country. [[05:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20343.76s)]
*  We must choose who the right people are. [[05:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20347.76s)]
*  Regardless of race, religion or geography, are these people going to contribute to British society? [[05:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20350.76s)]
*  Are these people going to integrate in British society? [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20356.76s)]
*  We've allowed foreign criminal gangs now to dominate London streets. [[05:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20361.76s)]
*  It's been going on for years and nobody even dares talk about it. [[05:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20366.76s)]
*  And don't even get me started on the Turkish barbershops. [[05:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20370.76s)]
*  I've been talking about this for some years. [[05:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20374.76s)]
*  I even raised it when I announced that I was going to stand in a general election last year on the 3rd of June. [[05:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20377.76s)]
*  Several in the press corps, I just thought I was off my rocker and they probably still do. [[05:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20383.76s)]
*  And I made the point that these are springing up everywhere. [[05:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20387.76s)]
*  They take cash only. [[05:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20390.76s)]
*  They don't cut anyone's hair. [[05:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20392.76s)]
*  They've all got a Lamborghini parked out the back. [[05:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20393.76s)]
*  Well I'm pleased to say the National Crime Agency has now raided 300 of these over the course of the last month. [[05:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20396.76s)]
*  And perhaps they should follow my social media a little bit more. [[05:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20401.76s)]
*  Think about this. [[05:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20406.76s)]
*  The Home Secretary has promised that she will, by the end of the year, start to publish the crime statistics. [[05:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20408.76s)]
*  And I hope that she does. [[05:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20415.76s)]
*  I hope she lives up to her word. [[05:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20416.76s)]
*  Because when this has happened in the rest of Europe, it has led to very dramatic political changes with the rise of passes, [[05:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20418.76s)]
*  many of whom we would not ourselves wish to directly associate with. [[05:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20427.76s)]
*  One little example. [[05:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20434.76s)]
*  Denmark allowed in 321 people, Palestinians, a couple of decades ago. [[05:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20436.76s)]
*  And 64% of that number have been convicted of crime. [[05:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20443.76s)]
*  It is stats like that that are fundamentally changing politics across Europe. [[05:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20446.76s)]
*  And in a way that can often be, I think, pretty unhelpful and further widen division. [[05:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20452.76s)]
*  And that division we've seen here too. [[05:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20458.76s)]
*  I'm afraid we've seen, and I predicted this some years ago, the growth of sectarian politics. [[05:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20461.76s)]
*  You know, the four people sit behind me in the chamber, along with Mr Corbyn, but the four are Gaza independents. [[05:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20467.76s)]
*  Their vote is purely on religious lines. [[05:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20475.76s)]
*  Now I've never seen sectarian politics in my lifetime in England, but I have seen it in Northern Ireland. [[05:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20480.76s)]
*  And all the baleful consequences that that led to. [[05:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20486.76s)]
*  I have a feeling that this is an issue that will really start to hurt the Labour Party by the time the next general election comes along, [[05:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20490.76s)]
*  where the Gaza independents will win many, many more seats. [[05:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20498.76s)]
*  Let alone South Asian gangs fighting on the streets of Leicester, [[05:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20502.76s)]
*  or the fact that one million people living here permanently speak little or no English whatsoever. [[05:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20507.76s)]
*  We have to be careful. [[05:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20514.76s)]
*  We've been subjected to lies, lies, lies. [[05:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20516.76s)]
*  Now we're in Dover because it was here in 2020, [[05:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20520.76s)]
*  just as the pandemic was kicking in and lockdown was starting, [[05:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20526.76s)]
*  that I began to go out from this port to film the migrant boats crossing. [[05:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20531.76s)]
*  It was a story that, you know, I mean, sort of Radio Kent would cover it. [[05:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20537.76s)]
*  It was a local story, but a story that nationally wasn't being told. [[05:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20541.76s)]
*  And it was very clear to me in 2020. [[05:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20546.76s)]
*  And I said that frankly, you might as well put up a sign on the White Cliffs of Dover, [[05:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20548.76s)]
*  everyone welcome. [[05:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20553.76s)]
*  And I predicted there would be an invasion. [[05:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20555.76s)]
*  It's a word that got me in very big trouble. [[05:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20557.76s)]
*  But have a look at the numbers that have come. [[05:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20559.76s)]
*  As for this government promising it would smash the gangs, I never believed a word of it. [[05:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20563.76s)]
*  There's as much chance of that working on our current course as there is of smashing the drug gangs, [[05:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20567.76s)]
*  something we've heard from governments for decade after decade. [[05:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20573.76s)]
*  Yet class A proliferates on every street in the country today. [[05:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20577.76s)]
*  Labour are doing very, very badly indeed. [[05:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20581.76s)]
*  In fact, year on year, the numbers crossing the channel are 40% up already. [[05:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20585.76s)]
*  And that's before we get the warmer water and the longer, clear, settle spells [[05:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20591.76s)]
*  of weather. [[05:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20596.76s)]
*  This is a national security emergency. [[05:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20598.76s)]
*  And one of the trends that we've noticed in the last few weeks are now a number of young Palestinians [[05:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20602.76s)]
*  coming in from Gaza. [[05:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20607.76s)]
*  And of course, they claim asylum. [[05:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20610.76s)]
*  They'll be granted asylum. [[05:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20612.76s)]
*  But frankly, letting people in from war zones, young males of fighting age from war zones, [[05:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20614.76s)]
*  when you don't know what their involvement in those areas might have been, [[05:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20620.76s)]
*  is an incredibly dangerous thing to do. [[05:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20624.76s)]
*  And I am the only party leader that has been trusted on legal immigration. [[05:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20628.76s)]
*  I've been arguing it since 2004. [[05:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20632.76s)]
*  And on illegal immigration, I've been arguing it since 2020. [[05:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20634.76s)]
*  These local elections on May the 1st, this issue will have a huge impact. [[05:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20638.76s)]
*  I will give you but one example this morning, which is a northern constituency [[05:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20643.76s)]
*  called Runcorn and Helsby. [[05:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20649.76s)]
*  There are 750 young men living in that constituency who have crossed the English Channel. [[05:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20651.76s)]
*  750 of them, just in one constituency. [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20658.76s)]
*  And the big debate and the big press coverage is all about the hotels, [[05:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20661.76s)]
*  something else that I exposed back in 2020. [[05:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20665.76s)]
*  But the hotels, frankly, are the least of the problem. [[05:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20668.76s)]
*  It's the HMOs that are increasingly becoming the issue, the houses of multiple occupancy. [[05:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20671.76s)]
*  And as we've been out and campaigned in that constituency, [[05:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20678.76s)]
*  yes, that house there, there are 10 men living in that house. [[05:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20681.76s)]
*  There are 15 men living in the house around the corner. [[05:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20684.76s)]
*  They loiter all day on the streets. [[05:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20687.76s)]
*  They follow our kids to school. [[05:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20690.76s)]
*  We're scared to go out in the evening. [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20692.76s)]
*  These are the impacts. [[05:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20694.76s)]
*  These are the impacts on the lives of a huge number of people in this country. [[05:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20696.76s)]
*  And yet Westminster just wants to cock a deafened. [[05:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20701.76s)]
*  It doesn't really want to engage with any of these things. [[05:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20704.76s)]
*  The cost just in that constituency alone to local government is £85,000 a day. [[05:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20708.76s)]
*  And it's the same here in Kent and it's the same everywhere. [[05:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20714.76s)]
*  The total cost for housing these people is not all met by national government through taxation. [[05:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20717.76s)]
*  20 to 25% of it has to be met by local authorities. [[05:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20723.76s)]
*  Well, you might say it's all well and good moaning and complaining about the failures [[05:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20727.76s)]
*  of the two so-called main, maybe not for long, political parties. [[05:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20732.76s)]
*  What I've tried to do there is to lay out some statistics over a broad range of issues [[05:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20736.76s)]
*  to show you the extent to which this population explosion has damaged the quality of... [[05:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20741.76s)]
*  I haven't even mentioned the roads, has damaged the quality of life for so many people. [[05:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20747.76s)]
*  So what do we, as the most trusted party in this area, what do we intend to do about it? [[05:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20752.76s)]
*  Well, frankly, the whole thing is pretty fruitless unless we leave the European Court of Human Rights [[05:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20758.76s)]
*  and repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act. [[05:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20765.76s)]
*  Every single week we see people, criminals, people who behave terribly, who ought to be deported. [[05:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20770.76s)]
*  But they're not because they claim the right to a family life under Article 8 of the ECHR, [[05:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20777.76s)]
*  something that our own judiciary leans on. [[05:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20783.76s)]
*  I recommit today we must have no more population increase due to net migration. [[05:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20786.76s)]
*  That is something we may have to revisit as the numbers that are leaving Britain [[05:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20792.76s)]
*  is going up pretty alarmingly, as is seen, of course, in the tax receipts [[05:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20797.76s)]
*  from Rachel Reeves' figures in the last few days. [[05:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20802.76s)]
*  We are committed to ending two-tier policing and two-tier justice. [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20806.76s)]
*  And frankly, that becomes ever clearer and clearer, particularly since Southport. [[05:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20813.76s)]
*  And it's something that is enraging the silent majority in this country. [[05:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20819.76s)]
*  And we will end all DEI recruitment in the public sector. [[05:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20825.76s)]
*  The fact that 43 police forces now discriminate against white people [[05:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20832.76s)]
*  in favour of ethnic minorities for jobs can only divide our country yet further. [[05:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20838.76s)]
*  It's a mistake. We as a political party are colourblind. [[05:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20843.76s)]
*  We couldn't care less what colour you are. We couldn't care less where you come from. [[05:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20847.76s)]
*  We couldn't care less what your religion is. [[05:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20851.76s)]
*  We just ask that if you come here, you work, you pay your taxes, you speak our language, [[05:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20854.76s)]
*  you integrate with us. Of course you can have your own private observance, [[05:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20860.76s)]
*  but that is what we demand of people. And we have to have a meritocratic society. [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20865.76s)]
*  That is the only way our private companies or our public sector can achieve their best. [[05:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20870.76s)]
*  And we will, of course, reiterate the fact that as an island we have advantages [[05:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20877.76s)]
*  and we need strong borders. [[05:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20884.76s)]
*  But enough of Home Secretary after Home Secretary making promises and dodging issues. [[05:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20886.76s)]
*  This Labour government claim they've increased deportations, but all they've done [[05:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20893.76s)]
*  is to send away visa overstayers and those who are happy to voluntarily return, [[05:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20897.76s)]
*  often with £3,000 in their pocket. [[05:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20903.76s)]
*  We will appoint, we will demand, this government does the same, [[05:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20907.76s)]
*  that there is a minister for deportations. [[05:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20910.76s)]
*  It will be part of the Home Office, but it will be a separate department within it. [[05:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20914.76s)]
*  We will need to recruit new people, as much of the evidence is that those that currently work [[05:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20919.76s)]
*  in the Home Office would willfully obstruct policy if we won the next general election. [[05:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20924.76s)]
*  But somebody somewhere in government needs to be held accountable. [[05:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20930.76s)]
*  And you know, you've only got to go back 20 years to a last Labour government [[05:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20934.76s)]
*  and they were deporting tens of thousands of people a year who were here illegally. [[05:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20938.76s)]
*  When Blunkett was Home Secretary, if you came illegally, you didn't touch the sides. [[05:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20943.76s)]
*  You were sent back. So what I'm calling for isn't actually anything particularly radical. [[05:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20948.76s)]
*  It's actually just common sense. It's what most countries in the world do. [[05:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20954.76s)]
*  You want to go and live there, you want to go and settle there, you have to meet a set of criteria. [[05:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20959.76s)]
*  And that country chooses, are you the right person or are you not? [[05:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20965.76s)]
*  I know the problem is huge because there are an estimated 1.2 million people here illegally. [[05:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20971.76s)]
*  And going beyond the last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job. [[05:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20980.76s)]
*  It's going to be one hell of a battle and we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us at every point. [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20986.76s)]
*  But it is our intention ultimately that if you've come illegally, you should not be able to stay. [[05:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20992.76s)]
*  You should not be able to make a spurious claim that somehow your right to a family life means you should stay here. [[05:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=20997.76s)]
*  We will, in three to four weeks' time, announce more detailed policy on how we will actually carry out those deportations. [[05:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21004.76s)]
*  We'll do that after the election, but I'll make the intention very, very clear here today. [[05:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21015.76s)]
*  We will bring a total end, a total end to all asylum claims from people who've come here on travel visas or who are overseas students. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21021.76s)]
*  We will demand the deportation of all foreign criminals. [[05:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21033.76s)]
*  And for those who come to Britain and who are granted citizenship, that will be regarded as a legally binding contract, just as it is in Australia and elsewhere. [[05:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21038.76s)]
*  We welcome you in if you make those pledges to us, but you actually have to obey the law and be somebody who is a positive benefit to our country. [[05:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21049.76s)]
*  We are a party who are very proud of the fact we had more votes in the general election from the ethnic minority vote than the Liberal Democrats did. [[05:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21059.76s)]
*  And an increasing number of people from all communities want to stand for our party. [[05:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21069.76s)]
*  These are people who came to Britain, or their parents came to Britain, because they wanted to be part of this great country. [[05:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21075.76s)]
*  They wanted to become a success in this great country. [[05:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21081.76s)]
*  So try, as anyone might, to twist anything I've said today. [[05:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21085.76s)]
*  All I've given you are hard facts. All I've laid out are sensible policies that will stop illegal immigration into Britain and stop the population explosion, [[05:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21089.76s)]
*  which is damaging the quality of life for so many countless millions. [[05:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21098.76s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[05:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21103.76s)]
*  Now we have quite a big press list, and I will go through it in order, beginning with Stanley Murphy-Johns from the Press Association. [[05:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21106.76s)]
*  Hi. So there's no formal pact between you and the Conservatives. [[05:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21117.76s)]
*  What, no formal pact with us and the party of mass immigration, did you say? So I missed you. [[05:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21125.76s)]
*  I missed you. [[05:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21129.76s)]
*  But there are rules to unite the right to democracy, so what could that look like? [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21130.76s)]
*  Good old Robert the Remainer. Good old Robert the man who's been on the democene conversion on the road to Damascus. [[05:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21138.76s)]
*  You will see on May the 2nd that our biggest gains are going to be in Labour voting areas. [[05:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21147.76s)]
*  That is where we are making most impact. [[05:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21159.76s)]
*  I would also tell you that the majority of our members and a big percentage of our voters at the last election were not voting Conservative, [[05:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21162.76s)]
*  because they loathed the Conservative Party. [[05:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21173.76s)]
*  They could not put up with the level of betrayal that had happened since the 2019 80 seat majority. [[05:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21176.76s)]
*  If we were to even contemplate doing a deal, our voters would be revolted by it. [[05:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21185.76s)]
*  Our party itself internally would be in revolt. [[05:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21194.76s)]
*  And if I wanted to do a deal with you of any kind, I would shake your hand, look you in the eye and do that deal because I trusted you. [[05:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21197.76s)]
*  I don't trust the Conservative Party in any way at all and we are going to replace them. [[05:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21206.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21211.76s)]
*  Next one, Kitty Donaldson from the I-Paper. [[05:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21212.76s)]
*  Just wondering about Birmingham, what would you do if you were in charge of the council there? [[05:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21215.76s)]
*  Would you separate, unite and what would you do if you were in the EU? [[05:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21225.76s)]
*  We want to re-industrialise Britain. [[05:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21229.76s)]
*  I worked for 22 years in the metals industry. [[05:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21232.76s)]
*  My clients worked rolling mills. [[05:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21235.76s)]
*  My clients produced lead sheet. [[05:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21237.76s)]
*  My clients manufactured copper wire. [[05:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21239.76s)]
*  These were the people I dealt with on a daily basis working in the metals industry in the city of London. [[05:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21241.76s)]
*  And I've seen nearly all of them go, disappear since 1990. [[05:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21247.76s)]
*  And we boast about the fact we've reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%. [[05:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21252.76s)]
*  It was no wonder, is it? [[05:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21257.76s)]
*  We've just exported CO2 emissions elsewhere and given ourselves the most expensive energy in the world. [[05:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21258.76s)]
*  To re-industrialise, we have to have a sensible grown-up relationship with the world. [[05:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21263.76s)]
*  We have to have a sensible grown-up relationship with the trade union movement because they're going to be a big part of us re-industrialising Britain. [[05:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21268.76s)]
*  This is not some dramatic U-turn by me or anything like this. [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21275.76s)]
*  It's a practical way of looking at how we do this. [[05:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21279.76s)]
*  As far as Birmingham's concerned, I sense that Birmingham is just the beginning of what is going to be a very, very difficult summer and autumn for the Labour government with the trade union movement. [[05:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21282.76s)]
*  They, of course, virtually own the Labour Party when you think that, you know, Unite have given them 28 million since 2020, the GMB have given them 20 million since 2020. [[05:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21293.76s)]
*  Sorry, other way around, 28, 20, other way around. [[05:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21301.76s)]
*  So they've really funded the Labour Party and they see weakness from the Labour Party. [[05:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21304.76s)]
*  And that, I think, is why we're going to see increasing disputes. [[05:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21309.76s)]
*  Clearly, clearly, as far as Birmingham is concerned, there is a national health hazard. [[05:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21313.76s)]
*  I understand some of the backlog is being cleared up. [[05:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21318.76s)]
*  I think the army was sent in, weren't they? [[05:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21321.76s)]
*  The army was sent in to help with logistics. [[05:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21324.76s)]
*  Well, perhaps they should have been sent in to clear up the rubbish a little bit earlier. [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21326.76s)]
*  I think it was fought on both sides with that. [[05:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21330.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21332.76s)]
*  Katie Harris from the Express. [[05:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21333.76s)]
*  Hiya. [[05:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21335.76s)]
*  Should any changes to post-Brexit fishing arrangements be incumbent on France stopping small boats? [[05:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21337.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit, and I speak as the only Member of Parliament that has a vested financial interest in a commercial fishing boat, which I do, [[05:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21343.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit there are more foreign boats fishing out here on the six mile line than we've ever seen at any point in previous history. [[05:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21356.76s)]
*  And that goes right the way down to Land's End. [[05:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21369.76s)]
*  The environmental damage to fish stocks in this eastern channel since Brexit has been horrendous. [[05:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21372.76s)]
*  The regulations put by the MMO and the MCA on our own fishing industry are so onerous and so expensive that, frankly, many of them think the situation is worse now than it was before we left the European Union. [[05:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21378.76s)]
*  And any further surrender of our fishing rights will literally finish off what was once a big industry. [[05:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21394.76s)]
*  And it's total and utter madness. [[05:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21400.76s)]
*  The minimum Brexit should have given us is the 12 mile line. [[05:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21403.76s)]
*  The maximum, of course, would have been a 200 mile exclusive economic zone as enjoyed by Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and any normal country in the world. [[05:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21406.76s)]
*  And I worry about that. [[05:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21417.76s)]
*  I worry about alignment with veterinary standards and food standards with the European Union. [[05:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21419.76s)]
*  I worry about alignment for carbon taxes, for example, with the European Union. [[05:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21426.76s)]
*  And I worry perhaps even more that on the 19th of March we're going to be talking about a form of military alignment, [[05:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21431.76s)]
*  which will include intelligence sharing to potentially a very high level that I think could fundamentally damage our relationship with NATO and America. [[05:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21440.76s)]
*  I worry that this prime minister, who, after all, is a remainer, in fact, it is a remainer Labour Party in a huge way. [[05:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21449.76s)]
*  I worry that he's going to take us so closely back towards alignment with the European Union and maybe even free movement of people for those under 30. [[05:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21457.76s)]
*  I worry about those things because I believe that it damages our ability to do business with the rest of the world. [[05:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21466.76s)]
*  And the bright economic future is not the Eurozone, believe you me. [[05:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21472.76s)]
*  Elizabeth Piper from Reuters. [[05:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21477.76s)]
*  Hello. [[05:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21480.76s)]
*  How are you? [[05:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21481.76s)]
*  Yours is a job. [[05:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21482.76s)]
*  I'm doing it. [[05:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21484.76s)]
*  This has been northern for the last few years. [[05:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21485.76s)]
*  The professionalisation of the party, you just said it in your opening remarks that that has now been done. [[05:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21487.76s)]
*  So you're saying that process is now complete or is there more to do? [[05:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21493.76s)]
*  And how would you answer those members who fear that that process has actually taken the party away from its heart and soul? [[05:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21497.76s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, hundreds of people who applied to be candidates for the county council elections were rejected. [[05:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21504.76s)]
*  Rejected often because of repeated use of words beginning with F and C on social media. [[05:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21518.76s)]
*  And, you know, that might be the way you talk to your mates in the pub. [[05:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21527.76s)]
*  But frankly, you're chucking it out on Facebook or exit really is something that's going to come back, come back and bite you. [[05:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21531.76s)]
*  Others, because they just said things that were just ridiculous, outrageous, embarrassing. [[05:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21537.76s)]
*  So professionalising the party had to be putting in a vetting system that was as good, if not better than the other parties. [[05:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21542.76s)]
*  And yes, that has upset some people in terms of professionalisation. [[05:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21550.76s)]
*  We've only just started. [[05:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21555.76s)]
*  I mean, the Liberal Democrats won 72 seats. [[05:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21557.76s)]
*  I mean, Liberal Democrats will increase their vote on May the 1st and much of it at the expense of the Conservative Party. [[05:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21561.76s)]
*  I can tell you because they're going to lose votes both ways on May the 1st. [[05:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21567.76s)]
*  But they've got a phenomenal, thriving branch structure. [[05:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21571.76s)]
*  And so much of successful politics is about the social element of politics. [[05:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21574.76s)]
*  Whether it was in the part of the world you come from, the Working Man's Club up north where the Labour Party was very strong. [[05:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21579.76s)]
*  Or whether it's the more genteel garden party of the Conservative, Local Conservative Association in the south of England. [[05:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21585.76s)]
*  And we've not yet been able to build those social interactions. [[05:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21595.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21601.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21631.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21661.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21691.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21721.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21751.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21781.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21811.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21841.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21871.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21901.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21931.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21961.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=21991.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22021.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22051.76s)]
*  Good morning ladies and gentlemen. [[06:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22082.76s)]
*  I'm Sir Youssef. [[06:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22086.76s)]
*  I'm the Chairman of Reform UK. [[06:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22088.76s)]
*  So since the general election last summer, Reform has delivered what is undoubtedly the greatest political acceleration in British history. [[06:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22090.76s)]
*  I'm proud to announce actually just this morning we broke 225,000 fully paid up Reform members. [[06:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22099.76s)]
*  That's up from 60,000 a year ago. Remarkable progress. [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22107.76s)]
*  You'd have seen in the national opinion polls two polls yesterday, one from more in common, one from YouGov showing Reform UK in a decisive lead. [[06:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22110.76s)]
*  We now lead nationally in the average of the polls. [[06:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22119.76s)]
*  We've gone from 14% vote share last July to 25% of the support in voting intention polls currently nationally. [[06:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22123.76s)]
*  Obviously, we've been working incredibly hard on the campaign trail ahead of these May the first elections. [[06:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22132.76s)]
*  In which we are proud to be fielding all but a full slate of candidates. [[06:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22139.76s)]
*  That's up from just 12% coverage in the equivalent elections last year. [[06:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22144.76s)]
*  We're also proud of the exceptional calibre of our candidates, including people like Sarah Pochin, for example, a former magistrate of two decades up in Runcorn. [[06:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22150.76s)]
*  And that, having spent quite a lot of time there myself, that campaign is going exceptionally well. [[06:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22160.76s)]
*  But all of our campaigns are going really well. [[06:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22165.76s)]
*  You've seen our leader, Nigel, has been covering ground at a rate that would put most to shame. [[06:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22167.76s)]
*  It's remarkable how many places Nigel has managed to get to, injecting people with energy and enthusiasm. [[06:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22175.76s)]
*  And that is, I think, the theme of this campaign. [[06:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22182.76s)]
*  Reform is simultaneously the most clear-eyed about the challenges that this great country faces. [[06:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22185.76s)]
*  But also hugely optimistic about how amazing this country can be again with the right leadership. [[06:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22191.76s)]
*  Now, today we're going to talk about policy, actually national policy, immigration. [[06:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22199.76s)]
*  More people trust Reform and Nigel with regards to securing our borders, stopping the boats, [[06:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22205.76s)]
*  and ultimately reasserting the rule of law when it comes to immigration policy in this country. [[06:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22211.76s)]
*  Clearly for too long that has not been the case. [[06:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22218.76s)]
*  And frankly, the social contract and the social fabric of this country is starting to fray [[06:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22221.76s)]
*  because of the sheer sense of unfairness that we see as a result of the hundreds of thousands and [[06:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22226.76s)]
*  half of people who have been crossing the channel illegally in small boats. [[06:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22232.76s)]
*  So to tell you more about that, I'd like to introduce you to the leader of Reform UK, [[06:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22237.76s)]
*  the Member of Parliament for Clacton-on-Sea, and the next Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22242.76s)]
*  Mr Nigel Farage. [[06:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22247.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22254.76s)]
*  Good morning everybody. [[06:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22256.76s)]
*  How fortunate I've been, or perhaps it was just good judgement, in picking Zia as party chairman [[06:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22258.76s)]
*  because the big thing we had to do after the last general election was to professionalise the party. [[06:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22264.76s)]
*  And we've done that. [[06:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22269.76s)]
*  And I'm very proud of the fact we've managed to put more candidates in the field for May 1st than any other party. [[06:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22271.76s)]
*  But today I wanted to talk about an issue that you may all think is a national issue [[06:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22277.76s)]
*  and one that perhaps doesn't impact on the May 1st elections, but you would be wrong. [[06:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22282.76s)]
*  Indeed, the population explosion that has happened in this country has had a bigger effect [[06:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22288.76s)]
*  on the lives of more people than any other single issue. [[06:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22294.76s)]
*  And it's interesting because up until 1997, this wasn't even a political debate. [[06:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22299.76s)]
*  Indeed, when I was first elected to the European Parliament in 1999, [[06:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22305.76s)]
*  immigration didn't appear in my election literature or manifesto at all. [[06:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22310.76s)]
*  And that's because simply from when rush, right up until Mr Blair became Prime Minister, [[06:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22316.76s)]
*  net migration into Britain had run at an average of 30 to 50,000 people a year, [[06:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22321.76s)]
*  sometimes higher, sometimes lower. [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22327.76s)]
*  It wasn't even a debate in successive general elections. [[06:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22330.76s)]
*  But the Labour Party under Blair decided that diversity was a good thing, [[06:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22335.76s)]
*  something that was never ever to be questioned, [[06:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22340.76s)]
*  and that mass immigration would be good for the economy, would make us all better off, [[06:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22344.76s)]
*  and frankly, anybody that dared to even question this up until at least 2010 [[06:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22349.76s)]
*  was considered completely and utterly beyond the pale, the worst of the worst. [[06:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22356.76s)]
*  And I know this because I first started speaking out about open borders in 2004 [[06:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22363.76s)]
*  when it became pretty obvious to me that opening up the door to eight and then ten former communist countries, [[06:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22368.76s)]
*  some of whom had an economy that were only the seventh the size of ours, [[06:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22376.76s)]
*  would lead to a huge inflow of people. [[06:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22380.76s)]
*  At least in those days, people that came did actually work. [[06:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22383.76s)]
*  That sadly has now all changed. [[06:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22387.76s)]
*  And since then, in every single general election, [[06:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22391.76s)]
*  we have made a series of promises that frankly amount to little more than a pack of lies. [[06:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22395.76s)]
*  The public being told what the parties think the public want to hear, [[06:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22402.76s)]
*  in fact know from polling what the public want to hear, [[06:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22406.76s)]
*  without any intention of delivering on it at all. [[06:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22410.76s)]
*  Of course, the Conservatives are far worse than Tony Blair. [[06:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22413.76s)]
*  Net migration to tens of thousands promised in 2010, 2015, 2017, and then 2019. [[06:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22417.76s)]
*  We were told substantially lower numbers. [[06:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22424.76s)]
*  We now have a Labour government who have promised they will radically bring down the numbers coming into Britain, [[06:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22426.76s)]
*  and we'll find out in June when we get the first ONS data whether that's true, [[06:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22433.76s)]
*  although I very much doubt it. [[06:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22437.76s)]
*  We've been told by successive prime ministers they would stop the boats, [[06:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22439.76s)]
*  even that they would smash the gangs. [[06:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22443.76s)]
*  Well, I'm afraid none of it has come true. [[06:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22446.76s)]
*  And I think it's about time we looked at the true cost of the population explosion to this country. [[06:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22449.76s)]
*  And I want to make this point very clear. [[06:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22457.76s)]
*  That recent polling, particularly polling that was published last week in the Sun newspaper, [[06:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22459.76s)]
*  which was the whole of the Midlands and the North, showed that we are now by far the most trusted party on this issue, [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22465.76s)]
*  and that I am by far the most trusted leader to do something about it. [[06:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22473.76s)]
*  It'll be good for the economy, is what we were told. [[06:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22479.76s)]
*  Well, 30 years ago, 7% of the workforce were foreign-born. [[06:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22482.76s)]
*  Today, 21% of the workforce are foreign-born. [[06:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22485.76s)]
*  That has directly led to a pay cut on average of about 3% per worker, [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22490.76s)]
*  which of course doesn't really mean very much if you're earning big money, [[06:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22495.76s)]
*  but if you're earning 20,000 pounds a year, it does mean quite a lot. [[06:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22499.76s)]
*  And interestingly, the Bank of England in 2015 produced a report showing a direct link [[06:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22502.76s)]
*  between numbers of foreign-born workers and wage suppression, [[06:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22508.76s)]
*  yet the whole thing was completely and utterly covered up. [[06:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22512.76s)]
*  The impact, of course, on wages is worse than that, given that there are 500,000, 700,000, [[06:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22517.76s)]
*  who knows, people working in the illegal economy, leading to further wage suppression. [[06:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22523.76s)]
*  The greatest myth, of course, is that it will be good for us, [[06:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22531.76s)]
*  and you must stop moaning about it because everybody that is here has come to work. [[06:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22534.76s)]
*  Well, try this statistic for size. [[06:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22538.76s)]
*  Foreign-born workers are 40% higher likely to be unemployed than British-born workers. [[06:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22541.76s)]
*  40% higher for foreign-born people to be on the unemployment register. [[06:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22549.76s)]
*  It's not a statistic I'd ever heard before. It's pretty mind-blowing. [[06:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22556.76s)]
*  And even the argument that, look, most people come here to work, so what is there to complain about? [[06:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22560.76s)]
*  What I'm afraid, that doesn't work either because in the last six years, [[06:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22566.76s)]
*  net three million people have settled in Britain from outside of Europe, [[06:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22571.76s)]
*  and of those, only 16% came on work visas. [[06:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22576.76s)]
*  It's a completely mind-blowing number. [[06:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22580.76s)]
*  Now it's true to say that many of those who've come perhaps will enter the workforce, [[06:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22583.76s)]
*  but you begin to understand that the argument for mass migration, [[06:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22588.76s)]
*  that it's needed for the labour market, actually isn't true when the majority that come, come as dependents. [[06:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22591.76s)]
*  The Centre for Migration Studies recently published that since 2020, [[06:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22598.76s)]
*  unemployment benefits to foreign-born people have been £36 billion. [[06:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22603.76s)]
*  We are talking simply about eye-watering numbers. [[06:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22609.76s)]
*  The other statistic that I was surprised by was that low-paid migrants on average cost the taxpayer [[06:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22614.76s)]
*  £150,000 by the time they reach retirement, let alone what that will be afterwards. [[06:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22620.76s)]
*  So let us be clear. Non-selective, in many cases non-working, [[06:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22627.76s)]
*  mass migration into Britain has made everybody in this country poorer, [[06:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22633.76s)]
*  except, of course, for big employers who love as much cheap migrant foreign labour [[06:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22638.76s)]
*  as they can possibly get their hands on, as the argument grows every year [[06:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22645.76s)]
*  that British people simply won't do those jobs. [[06:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22650.76s)]
*  But we're told it's okay, because we're growing, we're getting richer. [[06:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22656.76s)]
*  Gross domestic product is going up, and that's the only measure that anybody on the two front benches in parliament will ever talk about. [[06:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22660.76s)]
*  I did try the other day with Rachel Reeves, and she's trying too, [[06:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22669.76s)]
*  but I did try to make the argument that actually GDP in gross figures doesn't mean very much [[06:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22674.76s)]
*  when you have a population that's rising by three-quarters of a million or a million every year [[06:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22681.76s)]
*  directly as a result of open borders. Why not look at GDP per capita? [[06:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22686.76s)]
*  But no, nobody wants to engage with that. Well, the last two years have seen record levels of migration into Britain, [[06:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22692.76s)]
*  and GDP per capita has fallen in six of the last eight quarters. [[06:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22699.76s)]
*  We are getting poorer as a result of policies started by the Labour Party, [[06:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22705.76s)]
*  accelerated by the Conservative Party, and now being continued by Labour. [[06:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22710.76s)]
*  None of which, of course, means that we in this country don't want high-skilled, law-abiding people [[06:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22715.76s)]
*  to come into Britain, to work, pay taxes, add to our society. All of those things are good. [[06:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22722.76s)]
*  But we have to. We have to discriminate. Yes, that's the word I'm going to use. It means choose. [[06:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22729.76s)]
*  We have to discriminate in terms of who comes into our country and in what numbers. [[06:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22735.76s)]
*  To try and have a rational debate about housing is virtually impossible. [[06:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22742.76s)]
*  I've been trying for over ten years to engage other party leaders in a rational debate [[06:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22747.76s)]
*  about the terrible housing shortage, the cost of housing and rents in this country. [[06:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22752.76s)]
*  Nobody will engage with me. Of the house price rises that we've had over the last two decades, [[06:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22757.76s)]
*  25% of that is directly down to immigration and the rising population. [[06:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22764.76s)]
*  Indeed, even the Ministry of Housing themselves said in 2018, again suppressed, not publicised, [[06:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22771.76s)]
*  that a 1% increase in the number of households leads to a 2% increase in cost. [[06:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22779.76s)]
*  And just think on this. There were 23.7 million households when Mr Blair came to power. [[06:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22786.76s)]
*  There are now 28.5 million households. [[06:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22791.76s)]
*  Net migration has increased the population by 10 million in the last 20 years. [[06:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22796.76s)]
*  And the same goes for rent. Even in recent years, a third of rent rises since 2020 are directly down to rising population, [[06:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22802.76s)]
*  which means for the average renter, another £1,000 a year. [[06:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22811.76s)]
*  And think on this. This government is determined to build one and a half million new homes in the lifetime of this parliament, [[06:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22816.76s)]
*  just as the government before was committed to the same figure. [[06:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22823.76s)]
*  That will not have any impact on the housing crisis in Britain in any way at all. [[06:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22828.76s)]
*  We currently have to build a new house every two minutes. Yes, that's right. [[06:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22834.76s)]
*  We have to build one new house every two minutes just to cope with levels of net migration into Britain, [[06:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22839.76s)]
*  not dealing at all with the backlog that we've built up. [[06:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22847.76s)]
*  And perhaps one of the areas that is causing the most angst is social housing. [[06:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22852.76s)]
*  And we know we do have a shortage of social housing stock in our country. [[06:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22856.76s)]
*  But somebody who comes into the Port of Dover, a young man without any documents, who's come from goodness, knows where, who believes in who knows what, [[06:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22862.76s)]
*  once they give an indefinite leave to remain, and we increasingly do that because we find it too difficult to deport anybody anywhere, [[06:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22870.76s)]
*  they then effectively are homeless, which means, of course, they go straight to the top of the social housing list. [[06:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22878.76s)]
*  It's happening in every county. Just one example, Northumberland last year, [[06:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22885.76s)]
*  hundreds of asylum seekers who were given indefinite leave to remain went straight to the top of the housing queue, [[06:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22889.76s)]
*  whilst there were 14,000 people, families on the list who were put, I'm afraid, to the back. [[06:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22895.76s)]
*  That's just one county example, but it's happening literally everywhere. [[06:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22901.76s)]
*  But it's okay, we're told, we wouldn't be able to have a National Health Service if it wasn't for increasing net migration into Britain. [[06:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22905.76s)]
*  That is what we've been told over and over and over. [[06:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22912.76s)]
*  And you'll still hear those arguments on BBC Question Time pretty much every week. [[06:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22915.76s)]
*  We need foreign doctors and nurses. Well, I would put a different argument to you. [[06:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22920.76s)]
*  I would say we should probably be ashamed of ourselves for taking over 100,000 doctors and nurses from the Red List, [[06:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22925.76s)]
*  from underdeveloped countries, where undoubtedly those medical experts are needed even more than they're needed here. [[06:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22933.76s)]
*  Amazingly thing, 100,000 workers in 25 years coming from countries that need them more than us. [[06:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22941.76s)]
*  And yet, right at the moment, we only have 9,500 people in medical training of any kind at all. [[06:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22947.76s)]
*  It's almost as if the NHS is happier to take on agency staff from West Africa, [[06:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22953.76s)]
*  and we've sort of lost the idea that we should be training enough of our own doctors and nurses. [[06:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22960.76s)]
*  And perhaps one of the biggest political issues in Britain that affects people's lives is access to a GP appointment, [[06:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22966.76s)]
*  something that we pretty much took as a birthright, to be honest. [[06:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22971.76s)]
*  Well, have a think about this. 7.2 million foreign-born people have registered with GPs in the last 10 years. [[06:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22975.76s)]
*  And you're surprised you can't get an NHS appointment. [[06:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22985.76s)]
*  All I'm doing here is giving you cold, hard facts, all of which I can back up if you want further documentation. [[06:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22990.76s)]
*  I'm telling you the truth about the terrible, terrible mistakes that have been made by both of our so-called main parties. [[06:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=22999.76s)]
*  And one that is very difficult to talk about, because you're always told that you're scapegoating, [[06:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23006.76s)]
*  you're saying something that is truly beastly, is crime. [[06:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23011.76s)]
*  Mass immigration has increased crime in this country in actually quite a dramatic way. [[06:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23015.76s)]
*  Foreign-born nationals are 71% more likely to be convicted of sexual assault, [[06:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23022.76s)]
*  69% more likely to be convicted of drug offences, [[06:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23029.76s)]
*  39% more likely to be convicted of any kind of crime. [[06:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23035.76s)]
*  One in 50 Albanians in Britain is in jail. [[06:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23041.76s)]
*  Now what does that tell you? Does it tell you that the whole of Albania is rotten, that they're all awful? [[06:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23045.76s)]
*  No, what it tells you is if you come from a poorer country, [[06:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23049.76s)]
*  there are richer pickings in crime in London and Birmingham and Manchester and frankly even Dover than there are where you come from. [[06:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23053.76s)]
*  That's why I return to my point. We must discriminate when it comes to who can come into our country. [[06:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23062.76s)]
*  We must choose who the right people are. [[06:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23069.76s)]
*  Regardless of race, religion or geography, are these people going to contribute to British society? [[06:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23072.76s)]
*  Are these people going to integrate in British society? [[06:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23078.76s)]
*  We've allowed foreign criminal gangs now to dominate London streets. [[06:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23083.76s)]
*  It's been going on for years and nobody even dares talk about it. [[06:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23087.76s)]
*  And don't even get me started on the Turkish barber shops. [[06:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23091.76s)]
*  I've been talking about this for some years. [[06:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23095.76s)]
*  I even raised it when I announced that I was going to stand in a general election last year on the 3rd of June. [[06:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23098.76s)]
*  Several in the press corps, I just thought I was off my rocker and they probably still do. [[06:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23104.76s)]
*  But I made the point that these are springing up everywhere. [[06:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23108.76s)]
*  They take cash only. They don't cut anyone's hair. [[06:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23111.76s)]
*  They've all got a Lamborghini parked out the back. [[06:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23114.76s)]
*  Well, I'm pleased to say the National Crime Agency has now raided 300 of these over the course of the last month. [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23117.76s)]
*  And perhaps they should follow my social media a little bit more. [[06:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23123.76s)]
*  Think about this. The Home Secretary has promised that she will, by the end of the year, start to publish the crime statistics. [[06:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23128.76s)]
*  And I hope that she does. I hope she lives up to her word. [[06:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23137.76s)]
*  Because when this has happened in the rest of Europe, it has led to very dramatic political changes with the rise of passes, [[06:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23140.76s)]
*  many of whom we would not ourselves wish to directly associate with. [[06:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23149.76s)]
*  One little example. Denmark allowed in 321 people, Palestinians, a couple of decades ago. [[06:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23155.76s)]
*  And 64 percent of that number have been convicted of crime. [[06:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23164.76s)]
*  It is stats like that that are fundamentally changing politics across Europe and in a way that can often be, I think, [[06:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23168.76s)]
*  pretty unhelpful and further widen division. [[06:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23176.76s)]
*  And that division we've seen here too. [[06:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23180.76s)]
*  I'm afraid we've seen and I predicted this some years ago, the growth of sectarian politics. [[06:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23183.76s)]
*  You know, the four people sit behind me in the chamber, along with Mr Corbyn, but the four are Gaza independence. [[06:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23189.76s)]
*  Their vote is purely on religious lines. [[06:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23197.76s)]
*  Now, I've never seen sectarian politics in my lifetime in England, but I have seen it in Northern Ireland and all the baleful consequences that that led to. [[06:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23201.76s)]
*  I have a feeling that this is an issue that will really start to hurt the Labour Party by the time the next general election comes along, [[06:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23211.76s)]
*  where the Gaza independence will win many, many more seats. [[06:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23220.76s)]
*  Let alone South Asian gangs fighting on the streets of Leicester or the fact that one million people living here permanently speak little or no English whatsoever. [[06:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23224.76s)]
*  We have to be careful. [[06:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23235.76s)]
*  And we've been subjected to lies, lies, lies. [[06:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23237.76s)]
*  Now we're in Dover because it was here in 2020, just as the pandemic was kicking in and lockdown was starting, [[06:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23241.76s)]
*  that I began to go out from this port to film the migrant boats crossing. [[06:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23251.76s)]
*  It was a story that, you know, I mean, sort of Radio Kent would cover it. [[06:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23257.76s)]
*  It was a local story, but a story that nationally wasn't being told. [[06:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23261.76s)]
*  And it was very clear to me in 2020. [[06:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23267.76s)]
*  And I said that, frankly, you might as well put up a sign on the White Cliffs of Dover. [[06:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23269.76s)]
*  Everyone welcome. [[06:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23274.76s)]
*  And I predicted there would be an invasion. [[06:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23276.76s)]
*  It's a word that got me in very big trouble. [[06:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23278.76s)]
*  But have a look at the numbers that have come. [[06:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23280.76s)]
*  As for this government promising it was smashed the gangs, I never believed a word of it. [[06:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23284.76s)]
*  There's as much chance of that working on our current course as there is of smashing the drug gangs, [[06:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23288.76s)]
*  something we've heard from governments for decade after decade. [[06:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23294.76s)]
*  Yet class A proliferates on every street in the country today. [[06:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23298.76s)]
*  Labour are doing very, very badly indeed. [[06:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23302.76s)]
*  In fact, year on year, the numbers crossing the channel are 40% up already. [[06:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23306.76s)]
*  And that's before we get the warm water and the longer clear settle spells. [[06:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23312.76s)]
*  This is a national security emergency. [[06:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23317.76s)]
*  And one of the trends that we've noticed in the last few weeks are now a number of young Palestinians coming in from Gaza. [[06:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23322.76s)]
*  And of course, they claim asylum. [[06:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23330.76s)]
*  They'll be granted asylum. [[06:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23332.76s)]
*  But frankly, letting people in from war zones, young males of fighting age from war zones, [[06:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23334.76s)]
*  when you don't know what their involvement in those areas might have been is an incredibly dangerous thing to do. [[06:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23341.76s)]
*  And I am the only party leader that has been trusted on legal immigration. [[06:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23348.76s)]
*  I've been arguing it since 2004 and on illegal immigration. [[06:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23353.76s)]
*  I've been arguing it since 2020. [[06:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23357.76s)]
*  These local elections on May the 1st, this issue will have a huge impact. [[06:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23360.76s)]
*  I will give you but one example this morning, which is a northern constituency called Runcorn and Helsby. [[06:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23364.76s)]
*  There are 750 young men living in that constituency who have crossed the English Channel, 750 of them just in one constituency. [[06:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23372.76s)]
*  And the big debate and the big press coverage is all about the hotels, something else that I exposed back in 2020. [[06:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23382.76s)]
*  But the hotels, frankly, are the least of the problem. [[06:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23389.76s)]
*  It's the HMOs that are increasingly becoming the issue, the houses of multiple occupancy. [[06:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23392.76s)]
*  And as we've been out and campaigned in that constituency, yes, that house there, there are 10 men living in that house. [[06:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23399.76s)]
*  There are 15 men living in the house around the corner. [[06:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23405.76s)]
*  They loiter all day on the streets. [[06:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23409.76s)]
*  They follow our kids to school. [[06:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23411.76s)]
*  We're scared to go out in the evening. [[06:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23413.76s)]
*  These are the impacts. [[06:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23415.76s)]
*  These are the impacts on the lives of a huge number of people in this country. [[06:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23417.76s)]
*  And yet Westminster just wants to cock a deafon. [[06:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23422.76s)]
*  It doesn't really want to engage with any of these things. [[06:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23426.76s)]
*  The cost just in that constituency alone to local government is £85,000 a day. [[06:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23429.76s)]
*  And it's the same here in Kent and it's the same everywhere. [[06:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23435.76s)]
*  The total cost for housing these people is not all met by national government through taxation. [[06:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23438.76s)]
*  20 to 25% of it has to be met by local authorities. [[06:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23444.76s)]
*  Well, you might say it's all well and good moaning and complaining about the failures of the two so-called main, maybe not for long, political parties. [[06:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23449.76s)]
*  What I've tried to do there is to lay out some statistics over a broad range of issues to show you the extent to which this population explosion has damaged the quality of... [[06:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23457.76s)]
*  I haven't even mentioned the roads, has damaged the quality of life for so many people. [[06:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23468.76s)]
*  So what do we, as the most trusted party in this area, what do we intend to do about it? [[06:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23473.76s)]
*  Well, frankly, the whole thing is pretty fruitless unless we leave the European Court of Human Rights and repeal the 1998 Human Rights Act. [[06:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23480.76s)]
*  Every single week we see people, criminals, people who behave terribly, who ought to be deported. [[06:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23492.76s)]
*  But they're not because they claim the right to a family life under Article 8 of the ECHR, something that our own judiciary leans on. [[06:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23499.76s)]
*  I recommit today we must have no more population increase due to net migration. [[06:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23509.76s)]
*  That is something we may have to revisit as the numbers that are leaving Britain is going up pretty alarmingly, as is seen, of course, in the tax receipts from Rachel Reeves' figures in the last few days. [[06:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23515.76s)]
*  We are committed to ending two-tier policing and two-tier justice. [[06:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23528.76s)]
*  And frankly, that becomes ever clearer and clearer, particularly since Southport. [[06:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23535.76s)]
*  And it's something that is enraging the silent majority in this country. [[06:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23541.76s)]
*  And we will end all DEI recruitment in the public sector. [[06:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23547.76s)]
*  The fact that 43 police forces now discriminate against white people in favor of ethnic minorities for jobs could only divide our country yet further. [[06:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23553.76s)]
*  It's a mistake. We as a political party are colorblind. We couldn't care less what color you are. [[06:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23564.76s)]
*  We couldn't care less where you come from. We couldn't care less what your religion is. [[06:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23570.76s)]
*  We just ask that if you come here, you work, you pay your taxes, you speak our language, you integrate with us. [[06:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23574.76s)]
*  Of course, you can have your own private observance. But that is what we demand of people. [[06:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23583.76s)]
*  And we have to have a meritocratic society. That is the only way. [[06:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23588.76s)]
*  It's the only way our private companies or our public sector can achieve their best. [[06:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23592.76s)]
*  And we will, we will, of course, reiterate the fact that as an island we have advantages and we need strong borders. [[06:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23599.76s)]
*  But enough of Home Secretary after Home Secretary making promises and dodging issues. [[06:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23607.76s)]
*  This Labour government claim they've increased deportations, but all they've done is to send away visa overstayers [[06:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23614.76s)]
*  and those who are happy to voluntarily return, often with £3,000 in their pocket. [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23621.76s)]
*  We will appoint, we will demand, this government does the same, that there is a Minister for Deportations. [[06:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23628.76s)]
*  It will be part of the Home Office, but it will be a separate department within it. [[06:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23635.76s)]
*  We will need to recruit new people, as much of the evidence is that those that currently work in the Home Office [[06:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23640.76s)]
*  would willfully obstruct policy if we won the next general election. [[06:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23647.76s)]
*  But somebody somewhere in government needs to be held accountable. [[06:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23652.76s)]
*  And you know, you've only got to go back 20 years to a last Labour government [[06:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23656.76s)]
*  and they were deporting tens of thousands of people a year who were here illegally. [[06:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23660.76s)]
*  And Blunky was Home Secretary. If you came illegally, you didn't touch the sides. You were sent back. [[06:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23665.76s)]
*  So what I'm calling for isn't actually anything particularly radical. [[06:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23671.76s)]
*  It's actually just common sense. It's what most countries in the world do. [[06:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23675.76s)]
*  You want to go and live there, you want to go and settle there, you have to meet a set of criteria. [[06:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23680.76s)]
*  And that country chooses. Are you the right person or are you not? [[06:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23686.76s)]
*  I know the problem is huge because there are an estimated 1.2 million people here illegally. [[06:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23692.76s)]
*  And going beyond the last couple of hundred thousand is not going to be an easy job. [[06:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23701.76s)]
*  It's going to be one hell of a battle. And we know that the state and the apparatus of state will fight us at every point. [[06:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23707.76s)]
*  But it is our intention, ultimately, that if you've come illegally, you should not be able to stay. [[06:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23713.76s)]
*  You should not be able to make a spurious claim that somehow your right to a family life means you should stay here. [[06:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23718.76s)]
*  We will, in three to four weeks' time, announce more detailed policy on how we will actually carry out those deportations. [[06:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23725.76s)]
*  We'll do that after the election, but I'll make the intention very, very clear here today. [[06:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23736.76s)]
*  We will bring a total end, a total end to all asylum claims from people who've come here on travel visas or who are overseas students. [[06:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23742.76s)]
*  We will demand the deportation of all foreign criminals. [[06:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23754.76s)]
*  And for those who come to Britain and who are granted citizenship, that will be regarded as a legally binding contract, just as it is in Australia and elsewhere. [[06:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23759.76s)]
*  We welcome you in if you make those pledges to us, but you actually have to obey the law and be somebody who is a positive benefit to our country. [[06:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23770.76s)]
*  We are a party who are very proud of the fact we had more votes in the general election from the ethnic minority vote than the Liberal Democrats did. [[06:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23780.76s)]
*  And an increasing number of people from all communities want to stand for our party. [[06:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23790.76s)]
*  These are people who came to Britain, or their parents came to Britain, because they wanted to be part of this great country. [[06:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23796.76s)]
*  They wanted to become a success in this great country. [[06:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23802.76s)]
*  So try as anyone might to twist anything I've said today. [[06:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23806.76s)]
*  All I've given you are hard facts. [[06:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23810.76s)]
*  All I've laid out are sensible policies that will stop illegal immigration into Britain and stop the population explosion, which is damaging the quality of life for so many countless millions. [[06:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23812.76s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[06:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23824.76s)]
*  Now we have quite a big press list. [[06:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23827.76s)]
*  And I will go through it in order, beginning with Stanley Murphy-Johns from the Press Association. [[06:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23829.76s)]
*  Hi. So there's no wall between you and the Conservatives. [[06:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23837.76s)]
*  What, no wall between us and the party of mass immigration, did you say? Sorry, I missed you. [[06:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23846.76s)]
*  But there are walls to unite the right. So what could that look like? [[06:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23850.76s)]
*  Good old Robert the Remainer. Good old Robert the man who's been on the Damascene Road to Damascus, I mean the Damascene conversion on the road to Damascus. [[06:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23860.76s)]
*  You will see on May the 2nd that our biggest gains are going to be in Labour voting areas. [[06:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23872.76s)]
*  That is where we are making most impact. [[06:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23881.76s)]
*  I would also tell you that the majority of our members and a big percentage of our voters at the last election were not voting Conservative because they loathed the Conservative Party. [[06:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23885.76s)]
*  They could not put up with the level of betrayal that had happened since the 2019 80 seat majority. [[06:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23898.76s)]
*  If we were to even contemplate doing a deal, our voters would be revolted by it. [[06:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23906.76s)]
*  Our party itself internally would be in revolt. [[06:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23915.76s)]
*  And if I wanted to do a deal with you of any kind, I would shake your hand, look you in the eye and do that deal because I trusted you. [[06:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23919.76s)]
*  I don't trust the Conservative Party in any way at all and we are going to replace them. Thank you. [[06:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23928.76s)]
*  Next one, Kitty Donaldson from the I-Paper. [[06:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23934.76s)]
*  I want to view on the use of metal. [[06:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23949.76s)]
*  Look, we want to re-industrialise Britain. It is slightly separate to today's debate but we want to re-industrialise Britain. [[06:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23951.76s)]
*  I worked for 22 years in the metals industry. My clients worked rolling mills. My clients produced lead sheet. My clients manufactured copper wire. [[06:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23956.76s)]
*  These are the people I dealt with on a daily basis working in the metals industry in the city of London. [[06:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23966.76s)]
*  And I have seen nearly all of them go, disappear since 1990 and we boast about the fact we have reduced carbon dioxide emissions by 50%. [[06:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23972.76s)]
*  It was no wonder, is it? We have just exported CO2 emissions elsewhere and given ourselves the most expensive energy in the world. [[06:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23982.76s)]
*  To re-industrialise we have to have a sensible grown-up relationship with the trade union movement because they are going to be a big part of us re-industrialising Britain. [[06:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23988.76s)]
*  This is not some dramatic U-turn by me or anything like this. It is a practical way of looking at how we do this. [[06:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=23997.76s)]
*  As far as Birmingham is concerned, I sense that Birmingham is just the beginning of what is going to be a very, very difficult summer and autumn for the Labour government with the trade union movement. [[06:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24003.76s)]
*  They, of course, virtually own the Labour Party when you think that, you know, Unite have given them 28 million since 2020, the GMB have given them 20 million since 2020. [[06:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24015.76s)]
*  Sorry, other way around, 28, 20, other way around. So they have really funded the Labour Party and they see weakness from the Labour Party. [[06:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24023.76s)]
*  And that, I think, is why we are going to see increasing disputes. Clearly, clearly, as far as Birmingham is concerned, there is a national health hazard. [[06:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24031.76s)]
*  I understand some of the backlog is being cleared up. I think the army was sent in, weren't they? [[06:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24040.76s)]
*  The army was sent in to help with logistics. Well, perhaps they should have been sent in to clear up the rubbish a little bit earlier. [[06:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24045.76s)]
*  I think it was fought on both sides with that. Thank you. Katie Harris from the Express. [[06:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24051.76s)]
*  Hiya. Should any changes to post-Brexit fishing arrangements be implemented on France's southern small boats? [[06:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24057.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit, and I speak as the only Member of Parliament that has a vested financial interest in a commercial fishing boat, which I do, [[06:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24064.76s)]
*  I can tell you that since Brexit, there are more foreign boats fishing out here on the six mile line than we've ever seen at any point in previous history. [[06:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24077.76s)]
*  And that goes right the way down to Land's End. The environmental damage to fish stocks in this eastern channel since Brexit has been horrendous. [[06:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24090.76s)]
*  The regulations put by the MMO and the MCA on our own fishing industry are so onerous and so expensive that, frankly, many of them think the situation is worse now than it was before we left the European Union. [[06:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24099.76s)]
*  And any further surrender of our fishing rights will literally finish off what was once a big industry. And it's total and utter madness. [[06:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24115.76s)]
*  The minimum Brexit should have given us is the 12 mile line. The maximum, of course, would have been a 200 mile exclusive economic zone, as enjoyed by Norway, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, and any normal country in the world. [[06:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24124.76s)]
*  And I worry about that. I worry about alignment with veterinary standards and food standards with the European Union. [[06:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24138.76s)]
*  I worry about alignment for carbon taxes, for example, with the European Union. [[06:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24147.76s)]
*  And I worry perhaps even more that on the 19th of March we're going to be talking about a form of military alignment, which will include intelligence sharing to potentially a very high level that I think could fundamentally damage our relationship with NATO and America. [[06:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24152.76s)]
*  I worry that this Prime Minister, who, after all, is a Remainer, in fact, it is a Remainer Labour Party in a huge way. [[06:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24170.76s)]
*  I worry that he's going to take us so closely back towards alignment with the European Union and maybe even free movement of people for those under 30. [[06:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24178.76s)]
*  I worry about those things because I believe that it damages our ability to do business with the rest of the world. [[06:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24186.76s)]
*  And the bright economic future is not the Eurozone, believe you me. [[06:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24193.76s)]
*  Elizabeth Piper from Reuters. [[06:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24198.76s)]
*  Hello. [[06:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24201.76s)]
*  How are you? [[06:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24202.76s)]
*  Your is it, John. [[06:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24203.76s)]
*  I'm doing well. [[06:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24205.76s)]
*  This being Northern, the professionalisation of the party, you just said at the opening remarks that that has now been done. [[06:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24206.76s)]
*  So you're saying that process is now complete or is there more to do? [[06:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24214.76s)]
*  And how would you answer those members who fear that that process is actually taking the party away from its heart and soul? [[06:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24218.76s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, hundreds of people who applied to be candidates for the county council elections were rejected. [[06:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24224.76s)]
*  Often because of repeated use of words beginning with F and C on social media. [[06:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24238.76s)]
*  And, you know, that might be the way you talk to your mates in the pub. [[06:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24248.76s)]
*  But frankly, you're chucking it out on Facebook or X. [[06:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24251.76s)]
*  It really is something that's going to come back and bite you. [[06:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24254.76s)]
*  Others, because they just said things that were just ridiculous, outrageous, embarrassing. [[06:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24257.76s)]
*  So professionalising the party had to be putting in a vetting system that was as good, if not better, than the other parties. [[06:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24262.76s)]
*  And yes, that has upset some people in terms of professionalisation. [[06:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24272.76s)]
*  We've only just started. [[06:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24276.76s)]
*  I mean, the Liberal Democrats won 72 seats. [[06:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24278.76s)]
*  I mean, Liberal Democrats will increase their vote on May the 1st and much of it at the expense of the Conservative Party. [[06:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24282.76s)]
*  I can tell you because they're going to lose votes both ways on May the 1st. [[06:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24288.76s)]
*  But they've got a phenomenal, thriving branch structure. [[06:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24291.76s)]
*  And so much of successful politics is about the social element of politics, whether it was in the part of the world you come from, the working man's club up north where the Labour Party was very strong. [[06:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24295.76s)]
*  Or whether it's the more genteel garden party of the Conservative, local Conservative Association in the south of England. [[06:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24306.76s)]
*  And we've not yet been able to build those social interactions between people. [[06:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24316.76s)]
*  And that is something else we have to do. [[06:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24321.76s)]
*  We have to train them how to raise money, etc. [[06:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24324.76s)]
*  All I would say to you is I think in the last 10 months we've made incredible strides forward. [[06:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24326.76s)]
*  I wouldn't have done it without Zia and people like Zia with me and a very young, professional, dedicated team who even worked on Christmas Day. [[06:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24331.76s)]
*  So it's a work in progress. [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24339.76s)]
*  But I would say to you we've made enormous, enormous strides forward. [[06:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24342.76s)]
*  And one of the reasons we need to win a really good number of council seats is we can build teams of people around elected councillors. [[06:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24346.76s)]
*  I also said I would democratise the party. [[06:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24355.76s)]
*  I put in place a new constitution that was passed by the conference. [[06:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24358.76s)]
*  I've given away my two thirds ownership of the shares of the party and we will have a board with 50% elected representation that comes in over the course of this summer. [[06:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24363.76s)]
*  So I feel I've kept my promise to the members. [[06:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24374.76s)]
*  You know, there are some in every organisation that will moan. [[06:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24376.76s)]
*  But we've gone through 225,000 members this morning. [[06:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24379.76s)]
*  And for those that want to drag me into a political direction that perhaps some of the political parties in Europe are at or are headed to, then you know what? [[06:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24383.76s)]
*  I'm not for budging. I'm not for shifting. [[06:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24398.76s)]
*  I've always said this will be a non-sectarian, non-racist political party. [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24401.76s)]
*  That's how it was founded. That's what it'll be. [[06:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24406.76s)]
*  I don't get budged on that, not even by very, very rich men who own motorcar companies. [[06:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24409.76s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[06:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24414.76s)]
*  Next up, Daniel Ryanesson from the Kent Messenger Group. [[06:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24416.76s)]
*  Daniel. [[06:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24420.76s)]
*  Is reform going to win Kent Council election next week? [[06:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24421.76s)]
*  If so, what's the first thing we'll do? [[06:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24424.76s)]
*  That is a really hard question. [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24425.76s)]
*  I don't know is the honest answer. [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24427.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[06:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24430.76s)]
*  I sense the Labour vote. [[06:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24431.76s)]
*  I mean, don't forget, Kent's now got 11 Labour MPs. [[06:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24435.76s)]
*  11 Labour MPs and one Lib Dem in Tunbridge, Wales. [[06:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24438.76s)]
*  The politics of Kent, you know, as it did back in 97, of course, was a massive swing from all blue to half blue, half red in 97. [[06:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24441.76s)]
*  It's been even more dramatic this time. [[06:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24450.76s)]
*  We are going to do very, very well indeed. [[06:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24452.76s)]
*  We are going to win a lot of seats on Kent County Council. [[06:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24455.76s)]
*  Can we win an outright majority? [[06:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24457.76s)]
*  I simply, honestly, truthfully just don't know. [[06:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24459.76s)]
*  But that's what we're aiming for. [[06:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24464.76s)]
*  And if we were to succeed, what's the first thing we would do? [[06:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24466.76s)]
*  Bring in the auditors. [[06:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24470.76s)]
*  Why did they spend? [[06:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24473.76s)]
*  Why did they lose 60 million quid on a high risk stock market fund? [[06:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24475.76s)]
*  Well, you might as well put it on the 330 at Newmarket. [[06:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24481.76s)]
*  And bear in mind, this is the same Kent County Council who lost over 50 million with a bank in Iceland that was paying 8 percent interest rates. [[06:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24485.76s)]
*  But everybody else was paying 4. [[06:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24495.76s)]
*  I mean, you'd have thought maybe they'd have learned their lesson. [[06:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24496.76s)]
*  That's just one little example of what we believe to be gross financial mismanagement. [[06:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24499.76s)]
*  They're in a hell of a financial hole. [[06:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24505.76s)]
*  Seven hundred and twenty million pound accumulated debt. [[06:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24508.76s)]
*  Daily interest repayments of 85,000 pounds a day. [[06:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24512.76s)]
*  And all right, we know it's not easy. [[06:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24516.76s)]
*  You know, we know less money comes from central government. [[06:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24517.76s)]
*  We know that social care costs rise with an aging population. [[06:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24519.76s)]
*  We understand that successive lockdowns did damage the minds of quite a lot of young people. [[06:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24523.76s)]
*  So send needs are higher. [[06:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24528.76s)]
*  I'm not saying we can wave a magic wand, but can we put the thing under better management rather than I think the very complacent control it's had under the Conservatives over these last decades? [[06:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24529.76s)]
*  I believe we can. [[06:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24540.76s)]
*  Can county council is broken reform are going to come along and fix it. [[06:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24542.76s)]
*  Let's go to Amy Rogers from a telegraph, please. [[06:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24546.76s)]
*  Hi, thanks, Nigel. [[06:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24549.76s)]
*  You've proven to be that you've got no intention of forming coalitions with the Tories at any level. [[06:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24550.76s)]
*  Does that mean you're ruling out Tory reform coalitions or power sharing arrangements at council level after the election? [[06:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24555.76s)]
*  Or could you work with the Tories at local government? [[06:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24561.76s)]
*  We can work with anybody at local government. [[06:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24564.76s)]
*  We can work with independents. [[06:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24565.76s)]
*  We can work with Labour. [[06:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24566.76s)]
*  We can work with Lib Dems. [[06:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24568.76s)]
*  I mean, you know, if we're in that, I mean, you know, if getting back to the question from the Kemp Messenger Group, you know, if we're in that position, we would work with other people. [[06:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24569.76s)]
*  But our demands are that we bring the auditors in. [[06:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24578.76s)]
*  We have a look at what long term contracts have been signed. [[06:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24583.76s)]
*  We have a look at why so much money is being spent on consultants. [[06:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24587.76s)]
*  We have a look at why in some cases up to 10 million pounds a year are being spent on agency workers by county councils across this country. [[06:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24591.76s)]
*  We have a look at who the pothole contracts are with. [[06:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24601.76s)]
*  And if they were failing providers, why they signed up for five years or in one case, I know of 10 years. [[06:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24604.76s)]
*  So if we had people who agree that it's not the job of county councils to spend millions after millions on climate change, it's not the job of county councils to spend huge amounts of money on D.I. [[06:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24609.76s)]
*  But those areas like consultancies, those areas like massive bills for agency workers, I mean, you know, you might need agency workers in a short term emergency. [[06:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24620.76s)]
*  But why you're spending millions year after year, some of them are, I don't know. [[06:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24631.76s)]
*  So we would work with other people, you know, if we were able to achieve those objectives. [[06:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24635.76s)]
*  And that, I think, is what our voters would want and would demand of us. [[06:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24640.76s)]
*  Charlotte Wright from the BBC, although we'll do it face to face later, I guess. [[06:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24646.76s)]
*  Yes, Harry. [[06:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24650.76s)]
*  So you're here as part of the local election campaign here in Kent. [[06:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24651.76s)]
*  What powers would reform county councillors have to do anything differently when it comes to dealing with immigration? [[06:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24655.76s)]
*  Well, they could complain. [[06:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24662.76s)]
*  I mean, that's one thing they could do. [[06:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24664.76s)]
*  They could outright refuse to have migrant hotels or HMOs imposed upon them. [[06:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24666.76s)]
*  They could be damn difficult. [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24671.76s)]
*  And actually what you've seen in Parliament over the last five years, you know, individual cases, I mean, Pretty Patel's constituency, you know, migrant hotel was put in Pretty's constituency. [[06:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24672.76s)]
*  I turned up with an iPhone, filmed it all, and the next day the hotel was closed down and moved to a different constituency. [[06:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24682.76s)]
*  So you do get MPs who are able already, if they're in a position of power, to perhaps ease things for their constituents. [[06:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24688.76s)]
*  That's what we could do. [[06:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24694.76s)]
*  But, you know, there is an enormous burden from all of this. [[06:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24696.76s)]
*  But what a Kent County Council can do, you know, is, as I say, find out who the road contractor deals are with, what they're costing, why they're so ineffective. [[06:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24699.76s)]
*  You know, why is all this money being spent on wellness? [[06:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24709.76s)]
*  And I just think County Councils, you know, we know what the basic job of a County Council is. [[06:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24712.76s)]
*  I think they've extended way beyond that remit. [[06:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24717.76s)]
*  OK, moving on. [[06:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24721.76s)]
*  William John Russell from Reuters and other Reuters. [[06:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24722.76s)]
*  Fine. OK. [[06:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24725.76s)]
*  Amin Shemaz from The Guardian. [[06:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24729.76s)]
*  Hi. [[06:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24732.76s)]
*  The pollster Lord Chamberlain predicted that you will go to between 400 and 400 seats next week. [[06:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24733.76s)]
*  I'll buy him lunch if he's right. [[06:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24740.76s)]
*  Yeah. Do you think that's realistic? [[06:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24741.76s)]
*  And would you count that as a win? [[06:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24743.76s)]
*  I'll buy him a big lunch if he's right. [[06:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24744.76s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know. [[06:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24746.76s)]
*  I came into this campaign, and obviously we're very, very upset that Essex, that Suffolk, that Norfolk, that East Sussex, West Sussex, Hampshire, [[06:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24749.76s)]
*  Isle of Wight, I'm running out now. There's probably other ones there somewhere. [[06:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24761.76s)]
*  And the fact that five and a half million, oh, sorry, sorry. [[06:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24764.76s)]
*  The fact that five and a half million people have been denied their vote in what was some of our very strongest counties, [[06:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24766.76s)]
*  we're very, very angry about. [[06:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24773.76s)]
*  And there's no argument for it. [[06:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24775.76s)]
*  You know, Angela Reyna's so-called devolution of local government applies equally to Kent as it does to Essex. [[06:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24776.76s)]
*  And yet this side of the estuary are voting and that side are not. [[06:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24782.76s)]
*  So I said at the start of the campaign, my aim, my goal, my ambition was to win 200 county council or unitary equivalent seats. [[06:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24786.76s)]
*  That was my aim. [[06:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24794.76s)]
*  The other aim, of course, has been to take on Labour in Runcorn and Helsby, which is, I understand, their 16th safest seat in Britain, [[06:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24795.76s)]
*  and to run them close. [[06:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24803.76s)]
*  That was another aim that I set for May the 1st. [[06:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24805.76s)]
*  Let me tell you, we are running them close in Runcorn and Helsby. [[06:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24808.76s)]
*  In fact, I don't know. [[06:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24812.76s)]
*  We might even be doing a touch better than that. [[06:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24813.76s)]
*  There's still a week to go. [[06:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24814.76s)]
*  If Haywood is right, if we win that number of seats, then that will be quite a political revolution. [[06:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24816.76s)]
*  We will have to see. [[06:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24822.76s)]
*  Not long to wait now. [[06:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24825.76s)]
*  Emma Core from Global. [[06:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24827.76s)]
*  What do you make of the row where they blame Andrew Jenkins, eligible to run as reform's mayor in Lincolnshire? [[06:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24829.76s)]
*  She's in Hawkshire, isn't she? [[06:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24835.76s)]
*  And not within the region as per the rules. [[06:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24837.76s)]
*  Have you sorted this out? [[06:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24840.76s)]
*  Yeah, I think the Conservative candidate in Cambridge is not living within the constituency either, [[06:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24841.76s)]
*  so I think this is not something that's uncommon. [[06:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24845.76s)]
*  Andrea has got accommodation in Lincoln. [[06:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24847.76s)]
*  She's born and bred in Lincolnshire. [[06:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24850.76s)]
*  She was a county councillor for Boston. [[06:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24852.76s)]
*  Her grandfather was a fisherman in Grimsby. [[06:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24854.76s)]
*  Her links with Lincolnshire are pretty clear and strong. [[06:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24856.76s)]
*  She did win a surprise election in Leeds, you know, when she beat the dancing star and star of breakfast TV now. [[06:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24860.76s)]
*  So unsurprisingly, she got a property in that constituency. [[06:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24870.76s)]
*  And the one factor here that is difficult is that there is a seven-year-old boy who has quite severe educational learning difficulties. [[06:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24876.76s)]
*  And she said, look, if she's elected as mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, she will find the right school for him near Lincoln. [[06:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24888.76s)]
*  That's not something you can do literally overnight. [[06:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24896.76s)]
*  So, you know, she's living between the two. [[06:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24898.76s)]
*  That is a fact. [[06:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24900.76s)]
*  The fact is really quite vexatious complaints being put in. [[06:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24902.76s)]
*  Let me tell you this. [[06:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24905.76s)]
*  If they say that Andrea has broken the rules on Friday tomorrow at this hearing, do you know what it will mean? [[06:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24907.76s)]
*  It will mean the entire mayoral election is rerun. [[06:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24913.76s)]
*  It won't mean just that she's disqualified. [[06:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24918.76s)]
*  The whole thing will have to be rerun. [[06:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24920.76s)]
*  And I don't think the voters of Lincolnshire would like that very much. [[06:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24922.76s)]
*  So I expect tomorrow we get a common sense judgment that is based around the fact her situation and she's a single mum now. [[06:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24927.76s)]
*  Her situation with a seven-year-old boy with bad learning difficulties explains to some extent why she is where she is. [[06:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24935.76s)]
*  All right. [[06:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24942.76s)]
*  We will find out tomorrow morning. [[06:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24944.76s)]
*  Who was we? [[06:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24946.76s)]
*  We got Noah Hoffman from The Sun. [[06:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24947.76s)]
*  Hello. [[06:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24949.76s)]
*  Nigel, how would you ensure you talk about discriminating and making sure the right... [[06:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24952.76s)]
*  Choosing. [[06:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24956.76s)]
*  Choosing right migrants if they're highly skilled come to the UK. [[06:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24957.76s)]
*  To stop this concerning trend of sectarian politics that we see in the comments and just generally in sort of local areas, [[06:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24962.76s)]
*  how would you ensure that any new migrants have British values and are very determined to integrate where some have not? [[06:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24970.76s)]
*  Well, I think one of the big cons with this and one of the reasons that major problems have built up in some of our inner cities and northern towns in particular [[06:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24979.76s)]
*  is because of this family reunion policy. [[06:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24988.76s)]
*  Well, you know, somebody comes in as a low school worker, let's say for argument's sake, might work for a bit, might then be on benefits, [[06:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24991.76s)]
*  is then allowed to bring extended family from wherever it may be. [[06:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=24998.76s)]
*  They come in. [[06:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25001.76s)]
*  They don't learn the language. [[06:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25003.76s)]
*  They fail at school. [[06:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25005.76s)]
*  They become part of that welfareism system. [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25007.76s)]
*  And I think it's within that environment. [[06:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25010.76s)]
*  It's within that environment that extremist ideologies are more likely to thrive. [[06:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25012.76s)]
*  So that we have to be much, much more rigorous about family reunion, which, of course, makes up such a large number of those that have come to Britain. [[06:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25017.76s)]
*  And, you know, some will say that's tough, that's unfair, but look what the result of it has been. [[06:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25025.76s)]
*  It certainly hasn't been a positive one. [[06:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25029.76s)]
*  OK, we've got Camilla from the Daily Express. [[06:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25032.76s)]
*  That's the end of the video. [[06:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25037.76s)]
*  You're doing the video, right. [[06:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25040.76s)]
*  Whoever gave me this list is in for a bit of a talking to. [[06:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25042.76s)]
*  OK, who else have we got? [[06:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25048.76s)]
*  We've got Joshua from Bauer Media Group. [[06:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25050.76s)]
*  Hello, Nigel. [[06:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25052.76s)]
*  You mentioned about the rising set needs, the strength of the economy and the development services in Logan. [[06:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25054.76s)]
*  There's an issue that impacts parents in this country, parents in this county, and parents across the country. [[06:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25058.76s)]
*  What needs to be done to make sure that parents are supported and that just to ease the burden that they currently feel? [[06:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25063.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a massive problem. [[06:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25069.76s)]
*  I have to say for my own money, when you get to 18 and you put somebody on a disability register, unemployed, with a high level of benefits, [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25071.76s)]
*  you're telling people aged 18 that they're victims. [[06:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25087.76s)]
*  And if you are told you're a victim and you think you're a victim, you are very likely to stay as a victim. [[06:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25090.76s)]
*  And so many of these diagnoses, you know, for send before 18, for disability register after 18. [[06:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25100.76s)]
*  So many of these have been conducted on Zoom with the family GP. [[06:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25108.76s)]
*  I think that is a massive mistake. [[06:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25116.76s)]
*  I think if you're, you know, if I'm your family GP and I've known your family for generations and you're saying to me, Doc, there's a real problem here with depression or whatever it may be. [[06:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25121.76s)]
*  It's quite hard for me as your GP to say no. [[06:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25133.76s)]
*  So I don't think any, I don't think any of these allocations should be done by family GPs and that should be done independently. [[06:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25136.76s)]
*  And I think we are massively, I'm not being heartless here, I'm being frank. [[06:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25144.76s)]
*  I think we are massively over diagnosing those with mental illness problems, those with other general behavioral disabilities. [[06:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25150.76s)]
*  And I think we're creating a class of victims in Britain who will struggle ever to get out of it. [[06:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25162.76s)]
*  And that's not good for them. And it's not good for us. [[06:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25168.76s)]
*  So I worry about those things. [[06:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25170.76s)]
*  I do accept, though, I do accept that repeated lockdowns, particularly the third lockdown, were probably the biggest mistakes ever made by a peacetime government in this country. [[06:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25172.76s)]
*  And they have caused great long term harm. [[06:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25184.76s)]
*  Okay. And lastly here, before I do some one to ones with broadcast, Emma Core from LBC. [[06:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25187.76s)]
*  Okay. We are sorry. I apologize. We are done and dusted. Sorry. [[06:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25194.76s)]
*  I didn't know you were here. Thank you. [[07:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25202.76s)]
*  I just wanted to ask, we've got an article on the website today about multiculturalism and how it's failed. [[07:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25206.76s)]
*  Sorry. I wanted to ask, do you think multiculturalism is dead now in this country? [[07:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25212.76s)]
*  And if so, why? [[07:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25218.76s)]
*  Sadly, I think multiculturalism is alive and well. [[07:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25219.76s)]
*  That's what we've got the growth of sectarian politics. [[07:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25222.76s)]
*  And that's why we've got people marching on the streets of London. [[07:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25225.76s)]
*  It's why we had the provocation against the Jewish community that took place in South End last weekend. [[07:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25229.76s)]
*  Had that been done against any other religious or racial group in this country, [[07:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25236.76s)]
*  you know, the long arm of the law would have intervened very heavily and very, very quickly. [[07:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25241.76s)]
*  I think what has changed is the national narrative, the national narrative that multiculturalism is good. [[07:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25247.76s)]
*  The encouragement by a Labour Party in particular, you know, please, let's put you all in separate little boxes. [[07:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25256.76s)]
*  Let's have identity politics on a massive scale. [[07:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25263.76s)]
*  I think that and I think the realisation of what a huge error that was has been exposed probably best by Trevor Phillips, [[07:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25266.76s)]
*  you know, who was head of the Equalities and Human Rights Commission, [[07:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25274.76s)]
*  who recognises that actually encouraging difference was a mistake and that actually we must encourage a sense of togetherness, [[07:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25277.76s)]
*  whatever differences our backgrounds may be. [[07:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25288.76s)]
*  So that's the direction that we firmly want to go in. [[07:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25291.76s)]
*  We need to have a shared culture. [[07:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25294.76s)]
*  And that's the danger of allowing a lot of people into a country with whom you have no shared history, [[07:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25297.76s)]
*  with whom you have no shared culture, with whom you have little in common. [[07:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25304.76s)]
*  And I'm afraid successive governments haven't thought that mattered. [[07:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25309.76s)]
*  But now we know it matters. [[07:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25313.76s)]
*  And the narrative has changed. [[07:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25315.76s)]
*  The reality as yet has not. [[07:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25317.76s)]
*  Let's hope very soon it does. [[07:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25319.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25321.76s)]
*  Oh, Adam, I can do it now or face to face. [[07:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25322.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25325.76s)]
*  So you call for a UK Doge cutting the size of the state. [[07:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25326.76s)]
*  But now you're also calling for a new Minister of Deportation. [[07:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25331.76s)]
*  You're not making the Home Office even bigger. [[07:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25334.76s)]
*  Yes, but compared to the cost of £7 billion a year of dealing with what's coming over the English Channel, [[07:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25336.76s)]
*  if we can put a stop to that, it'll save a lot of money very, very quickly indeed. [[07:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25344.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25349.76s)]
*  Sorry. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25350.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25351.76s)]
*  Again, I was going to do it face to face on camera. [[07:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25352.76s)]
*  But. [[07:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25353.76s)]
*  This one here. [[07:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25354.76s)]
*  Is Richard Tice wrong that Robert Jennings just in the wrong past? [[07:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25355.76s)]
*  I say, well, Richard is right. [[07:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25360.76s)]
*  You know, I reckon at least 50 of the Conservative MPs ought to be in the Liberal Democrats. [[07:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25362.76s)]
*  I reckon about 21 of the Tory MPs ought to be in reform. [[07:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25368.76s)]
*  I'm not sure which I'm not sure whether I'm not even sure whether Jennings one of them. [[07:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25373.76s)]
*  Maybe he is. [[07:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25377.76s)]
*  Maybe he's genuine. [[07:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25378.76s)]
*  Maybe he really has been on this damascene conversion. [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25379.76s)]
*  I just don't know. [[07:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25382.76s)]
*  And I have to say, I thought in the leadership contest, he was a bit like a Nigel Farage impersonator. [[07:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25383.76s)]
*  And I had a chat with him in the gallery in the voting lobby shortly after. [[07:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25388.76s)]
*  I said, well, look, mate, you know, if you want some lessons in getting a personality, I mean, I'm your man. [[07:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25392.76s)]
*  You know, I can help you. [[07:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25396.76s)]
*  So I don't know. [[07:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25398.76s)]
*  But I think I mean, more seriously, I think. [[07:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25400.76s)]
*  I think. [[07:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25402.76s)]
*  You know, can we bad knocks problem is twofold. [[07:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25403.76s)]
*  Number one, if she criticizes what's happening in the English Channel, if she criticizes mass migration, if she criticizes high taxation, [[07:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25408.76s)]
*  if she criticizes the increasing size of a state, if she criticizes the hugely increasing debt burden. [[07:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25417.76s)]
*  Well, what did you do for the last 14 years? [[07:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25423.76s)]
*  I mean, it's the same with the grooming gangs. [[07:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25425.76s)]
*  Where was she as Minister for Women? [[07:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25429.76s)]
*  Two years she was Minister for Women. [[07:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25432.76s)]
*  Didn't mention grooming gangs once that I can see. [[07:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25434.76s)]
*  So one massive problem they've got is they can't live down the past. [[07:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25437.76s)]
*  And I think there are many voters. [[07:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25441.76s)]
*  You know, you can talk Red Wall, but there are parts of Kent here that, you know, went conservative in 2019. [[07:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25443.76s)]
*  That vote's not coming back. [[07:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25448.76s)]
*  That's one problem they've got. [[07:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25450.76s)]
*  The second problem they've got is they're so split that no one really knows what they genuinely stand for. [[07:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25451.76s)]
*  And I think what you're going to see on May the 1st is a lot of conservative voters coming to us, [[07:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25457.76s)]
*  but equally quite a lot of the remainder conservatives going in the direction of Liberal Democrats. [[07:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25464.76s)]
*  And that, you know, and they may have been around for 195 years, [[07:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25471.76s)]
*  just as the Liberals were the natural party of government until the Labour Party came along in 1918. [[07:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25476.76s)]
*  And I think we are potentially at one of those once in a century big moments in politics [[07:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25482.76s)]
*  where an established party that's been a party of government no longer serves any purpose. [[07:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25488.76s)]
*  And it goes back to the earlier questions that I was asked by the Press Association about, you know, [[07:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25494.76s)]
*  do I want to do deals, et cetera? [[07:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25500.76s)]
*  No, our aim is to replace the Conservative Party as the party of opposition to this Labour government. [[07:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25502.76s)]
*  And that is what we're going to try and do. [[07:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25508.76s)]
*  All right. Thank you very much, everybody. [[07:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25510.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25540.76s)]
*  Good morning, everybody. [[07:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25570.76s)]
*  How fortunate I've been, or perhaps it was just good judgment. [[07:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruSyOjfH6Ms&t=25592.76s)]
