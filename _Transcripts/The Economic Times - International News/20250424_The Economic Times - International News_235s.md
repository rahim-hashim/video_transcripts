*  You said England [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=83.84s)]
*  India [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=86.48s)]
*  They're not very complicated these deals [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=91.16000000000001s)]
*  It's about the tariffs India charges almost more than any other country in the world and believe it or not [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=93.68s)]
*  we do very little business within the other the fact that I I like the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=100.16s)]
*  Prime Minister very much. She's a friend of mine. He was here two weeks ago as you know [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=105.03999999999999s)]
*  And we stood right outside in a news conference. Unfortunately, the grass was very wet [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=109.32s)]
*  It was very hard for people to stand on the grass. They got their shoes all [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  ruined but other than that it was a very good news conference and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=119.16s)]
*  He's a great guy, but we do very little business [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=123.47999999999999s)]
*  You know why because their tariffs are so high they have among the highest tariffs higher than China [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=125.56s)]
*  They have among the highest tariffs in the world [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=130.56s)]
*  And I understand they're gonna reduce those tariffs, but it's really [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=133.96s)]
*  It's really sort of their problem. Not ours. We do [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=139.28s)]
*  Very very little purchasing in India because they're dead and selling we do very little selling [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=143.0s)]
*  I mean Harley Davidson. I said how you're doing in India. This is [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=148.36s)]
*  About six years ago they came to lunch [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  As a great American company they make their motorcycles and I said how are you doing in India as an example? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=156.35999999999999s)]
*  Well, we don't do any business there. Why because the tariffs are too high. I [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=162.51999999999998s)]
*  Said that's interesting. Well, what are you gonna do? He said well, we're gonna build a plant in India and that's what they did [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=166.68s)]
*  I don't want that to happen [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=172.0s)]
*  They were forced to build a plant. Well, essentially what we're doing is same thing. Remember, there's no tariff when they build their plant here [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=174.32s)]
*  Everybody wants to build because they don't want and the higher the tariffs go [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=182.44s)]
*  The more likely it is they come in and build the plant, you know, I mean if it's 25% [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  That's fine [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=190.64s)]
*  If it's 50% you'll get more plants 75 you get more and a hundred you get more than that [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=191.39999999999998s)]
*  And they're all coming in at numbers that nobody's I don't think Howard there's ever been numbers like we've seen [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=196.51999999999998s)]
*  No, seven eight trillion dollars worth in two months [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=202.5s)]
*  Because I you know, it took me a month to get started in all fairness [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  In two months we [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=210.84s)]
*  We did this and now we're coming up with a hundred a hundred days first hundred days [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=213.2s)]
*  And I think we're gonna be close to eight trillion dollars [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=218.07999999999998s)]
*  There was never any president did did even a tiny percentage of that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PttfDbq1Cg&t=221.28s)]
