Video Description: During a joint press conference with Italian PM Giorgia Meloni, President Trump declared that tariffs are ‘making us rich,’ contrasting his trade record with Biden’s, whom he accused of losing trillions. Trump touted billions collected from tariffs on cars, steel, aluminum, and penalties on China, Mexico, and Canada over fentanyl. He claimed over $700 billion was taken from China alone and said his trade policy built ‘the strongest economy in the history of our country.’

*  My tariffs on china nobody ever took in ten cents from china. No other president took in ten cents [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=118.0s)]
*  I took in more than 700 billion dollars from china. So [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=123.44000000000001s)]
*  we're uh [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=127.84s)]
*  We're doing very well. I mean our country is doing very well. They had a bad [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  report today from one of the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=133.68s)]
*  healthcare companies [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=135.68s)]
*  That had an impact on the stock market, but [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=137.28s)]
*  This is about that this is really we're building a base we're building a country like no other [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=140.08s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far history of any country probably [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=145.12s)]
*  But the history of our country in four years [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Can you [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=156.32s)]

*  We're still working on the details. We're shooting for around April 26th [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=171.6s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=175.44s)]
*  It's substantially [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=180.16s)]
*  what we've agreed on previously but the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=181.84s)]
*  President was here. We had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=184.88s)]
*  The I think it's an 80-page agreement and that's what we'll be signing [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTxwloktbwk&t=191.36s)]
