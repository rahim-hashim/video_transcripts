# ‘Canada would ‘cease to exist’ without the US’: Trump mocks Northern neighbour over tariffs
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU)
*  I think this country, I'm not running Canada. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=0.0s)]
*  $200 billion, it doesn't make sense. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=2.0s)]
*  If we needed something, that would be a different subject. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=4.24s)]
*  So I'm working well with Canada. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  We're doing very well. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=11.32s)]
*  We're working on a deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=12.6s)]
*  If they didn't have us, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  and if we didn't spend that money, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=16.12s)]
*  as Trudeau told me, they would cease to exist. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=18.52s)]
*  U.S. President Donald Trump has said [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Canada would cease to exist [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  if it weren't for the United States. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=25.96s)]
*  His comments come days ahead of federal elections [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=28.4s)]
*  in America's northern neighbor. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=31.48s)]
*  Trump reiterated that the U.S. does not need anything from Canada, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=33.68s)]
*  including autos and oil. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=38.68s)]
*  The U.S. president, however, has dialed back on his talk of Canada [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=40.92s)]
*  becoming the 51st state. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=45.36s)]
*  Trump spoke to Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney last month. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=47.64s)]
*  Canada has an election coming up. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=51.08s)]
*  Do you have a prediction for that? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=52.92s)]
*  And what do you think the results are? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  With respect to Canada? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=55.96s)]
*  With the negotiations? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=57.239999999999995s)]
*  Oh, I don't want to predict other nations' elections. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=58.04s)]
*  It's tough enough doing this one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Look, I love the Canadian people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=65.4s)]
*  I like Canada. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=68.2s)]
*  But it's costing us $200 billion a year to support Canada. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  $200 billion. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=75.2s)]
*  And I say, why are we doing that? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=76.88s)]
*  You know what? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=78.28s)]
*  We can make our own cars. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=78.68s)]
*  We have more energy than they do. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=80.64s)]
*  We have more energy than anybody in the world. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=82.44s)]
*  We don't need their lumber, obviously. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=85.24s)]
*  We have more lumber. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=86.92s)]
*  We have a lot of lumber. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=88.44s)]
*  We have a lot of everything that they sell us. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  But in particular, cars. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  They took a large percentage of the car making, and I want to bring it back to this country. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=93.88s)]
*  I really don't want cars from Canada. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=98.24s)]
*  So when I put tariffs on Canada, they're paying 25 percent. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=100.56s)]
*  But that could go up in terms of cars. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=103.6s)]
*  When we put tariffs on it, all we're doing is we're saying, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=107.56s)]
*  we don't want your cars in all due respect. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=111.44s)]
*  We want really to make our own cars. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  Which is what we're doing in record numbers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=116.76s)]
*  Now, you know, we're going to be at record levels in the very near future [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=118.6s)]
*  because of all the plants, the car plants that are being built. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=121.52s)]
*  And I'd rather see a made in Michigan and made in South Carolina and made in different states. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=125.16s)]
*  Tennessee, we have a lot of great car making states, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=131.2s)]
*  and we have some that aren't car making yet, but they will soon be car making states. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=135.36s)]
*  And that's what I want to see for our country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=139.68s)]
*  At the same time, I want to help Canada. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=142.72s)]
*  As to, I have spoken to the current prime minister. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=145.64s)]
*  He was very, very nice, I will say. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=149.92s)]
*  We had a couple of very nice conversations, very good. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=152.2s)]
*  But I don't think it's appropriate for me to get involved in their election. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump also said he's running the U.S., not Canada, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  when asked on tariffing the auto sector in the country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=162.92s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=166.4s)]
*  On tariffs, you just mentioned that 25 percent could go up in cars in terms of Canada. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=167.28s)]
*  Does that mean that you're considering changes to the auto tariffs and auto parts? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=172.64s)]
*  No, we're not considering it now, but at some point it could go up, yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  Because, again, we don't really want Canada to make cars for us, to put it bluntly. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=179.16s)]
*  We want to make our own cars, and we're now equipped to do that. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=185.0s)]
*  And they took a lot of our car business. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=189.04s)]
*  Mexico, too, took a lot of our car business. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=190.84s)]
*  We want to make the cars here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=193.0s)]
*  I'm running this country, I'm not running Canada. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=194.4s)]
*  And that's why I asked Trudeau, who I call Governor Trudeau, affectionately, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=197.44s)]
*  but I asked him, why are we spending $200 billion to support Canada, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=203.64000000000001s)]
*  to subsidize Canada, and he was unable to answer the question. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=210.28s)]
*  I mean, why are we doing that? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  And I have to be honest, as a state, it works great. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=215.08s)]
*  As a nation, considering the fact that most of the nation, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=220.08s)]
*  95% of Canada, what they do is they buy from us, and they sell to us. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  They sell to us. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=230.24s)]
*  If we didn't buy their oil, if we didn't buy their, and we don't need their oil. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=231.24s)]
*  We have more oil than anyone, but we don't need their oil, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=236.36s)]
*  we don't need their lumber, we don't need their cars, we don't need anything. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  So I said, why are we doing this? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  Why are we spending $200 billion? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=243.88s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=245.88s)]
*  If we needed something, that would be a different subject. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=246.72s)]
*  So I'm working well with Canada. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  We're doing very well. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=253.84s)]
*  We're working on a deal. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=255.08s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  But again, representing this country, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  why are we spending $200 billion to support and subsidize another country? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  Because if they didn't have us, and if we didn't spend that money, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=271.0s)]
*  as Trudeau told me, they would cease to exist. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=275.76s)]
*  He said that to me, they would cease to exist, which is true, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=278.44s)]
*  certainly as a country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kg3fCToGPjU&t=281.76s)]
