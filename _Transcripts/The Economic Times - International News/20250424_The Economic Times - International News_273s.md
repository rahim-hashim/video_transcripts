Video Description: US President Donald Trump could re-impose ‘reciprocal’ tariffs on some countries in two to three weeks, potentially re-escalating the global trade war that has already raised fears of a US and global recession. Trump paused reciprocal tariffs on most countries on April 9, a week after imposing sweeping tariffs on almost all nations as part of his Liberation Day announcement on April 2.

# Trump starts ticking the clock for new tariffs, re-escalating trade war amid ongoing negotiations
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE)
*  My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. President Donald Trump could reimpose reciprocal tariffs on some countries in two [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=13.36s)]
*  to three weeks, potentially reescalating the global trade war that has already raised fears [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=18.52s)]
*  of a U.S. and global recession. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=24.62s)]
*  We have a situation where we have a very, very great place. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=27.02s)]
*  It's called the United States of America, and it's been ripped off for years and years. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=32.62s)]
*  These people know it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=37.5s)]
*  We talked about it before you came in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=38.5s)]
*  We've been ripped off by every country in the world, practically, and friend and foe. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=40.58s)]
*  And we will — we're not doing that anymore. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=46.22s)]
*  So what's happened is we've — Howard, how many countries have we spoken to already? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=49.019999999999996s)]
*  Ninety. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=54.42s)]
*  Ninety. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=55.42s)]
*  And they all want to make deals, and we're going to make deals. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=57.38s)]
*  But they're going to be fair deals. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=62.02s)]
*  They're not going to be ripoff deals. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=63.02s)]
*  And, you know, we were losing almost $5 billion a year. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=64.54s)]
*  No country can do that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=69.3s)]
*  And now we have it down almost to even — maybe even better than even because of the tariffs [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=71.34s)]
*  on cars and aluminum and steel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=76.1s)]
*  We have tariffs, 25 percent, on cars, aluminum and steel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=79.1s)]
*  There's a rush to build new steel plants, a rush to build new aluminum plants, and a [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=83.06s)]
*  biggest rush I've ever seen — that we've ever seen — to build car plants. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=87.74s)]
*  We have, like, 11 of them or something. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=92.3s)]
*  Big ones, where you guys maybe work — maybe you won't want to work. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=94.46s)]
*  You'll do something else instead of that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=97.97999999999999s)]
*  But if you like cars, you'd like to work on one of these plants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  The biggest plants in the world. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  Three of them have left Mexico before construction started. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=104.06s)]
*  One of them during construction. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=106.97999999999999s)]
*  And they're coming to this country. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=109.34s)]
*  They're coming back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=110.78s)]
*  Don't forget. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=111.78s)]
*  We get along great with Mexico, but Mexico took 32 percent of our car-building business. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=112.82000000000001s)]
*  So it's amazing what's happened. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=118.34s)]
*  Remember this number. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  Anywhere from $3 to $5 billion a day. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=123.54s)]
*  That's not million dollars. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=127.74000000000001s)]
*  That's billion dollars a day. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=129.74s)]
*  Nobody can even imagine it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=131.22s)]
*  And that's what we were losing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=133.54s)]
*  And, you know, hence we have $36 trillion in debt and everything else. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=134.54s)]
*  And in the end, I think what's going to happen is we're going to have great deals. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=139.06s)]
*  And by the way, if we don't have a deal with a company or a country, we're going to set [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=142.54s)]
*  the tariff. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=146.94s)]
*  We just set the tariff. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=147.94s)]
*  It's something that we think that will happen, I'd say, over the next couple of weeks. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=148.94s)]
*  Wouldn't you say? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=152.26s)]
*  I think so. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=153.26s)]
*  Over the next two, three weeks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=154.26s)]
*  We'll be setting the number. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=155.26s)]
*  And we're going to pick — could be for China, too. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=156.98s)]
*  Could be for China. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  We'll — [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  Trump paused reciprocal tariffs on most countries on April 9th, a week after imposing sweeping [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  tariffs on almost all nations as part of his Liberation Day announcement on April 2nd. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=168.78s)]
*  The reprieve was supposed to be for 90 days to allow countries to negotiate with the administration. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=174.34s)]
*  Around 90 to 100 countries have offered to negotiate deals, the Trump administration [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=181.02s)]
*  said. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=186.3s)]
*  Trump could impose his tariffs on countries that rise as high as 50 percent without negotiated [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  deals. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=193.3s)]
*  China, the second largest economy, which had 34 percent tariffs imposed counter tariffs, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=194.3s)]
*  resulting in escalations which have made tariffs reach 145 percent for the Asian country. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=201.66000000000003s)]
*  The United States currently maintains a 10 percent universal tariff on virtually every [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=208.78s)]
*  good imported to America, plus higher rates for certain goods. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  Trump's back-and-forth stance on tariffs has caused uncertainty for businesses and [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=219.26s)]
*  consumers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=223.29999999999998s)]
*  It has also impacted markets, causing an initial tumble on stocks and U.S. assets. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=224.72s)]
*  The S&P 500 saw a two-day market rebound, but has lost $7 trillion in value since its [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=230.62s)]
*  mid-February record high. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=237.45999999999998s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson's acknowledgement of China tariffs being extremely high, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=240.22s)]
*  Trump echoing the sentiment led markets into recovery with stock surging on April 22nd. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=245.54s)]
*  The U.S. has hinted openness in its negotiations with China on tariffs, but Beijing has made [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=251.22s)]
*  it clear that it will not respond to a language of threats. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ol_iobSxFdE&t=257.3s)]
