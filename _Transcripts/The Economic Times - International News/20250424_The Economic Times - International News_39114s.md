# LIVE | Canada Elections 2025: PM Mark Carney holds rally in Surrey, British Columbia ahead of Apr 28
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw)
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=0.0s)]
*  I wrote that song in December of 2016 right after a very televised election in the United [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9.68s)]
*  States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15.36s)]
*  And I realized that the fear that I feel about the world, it is the same fear. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25.76s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32.52s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=42.36s)]
*  Thank you, Diana. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=51.36s)]
*  Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=52.6s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=59.28s)]
*  something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and compassion as in everything [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  that she does. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=71.84s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=73.2s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=80.92s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=82.72s)]
*  And it's great. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=90.72s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  to build Canada strong. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=105.56s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=110.92s)]
*  Who's ready? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=119.72s)]
*  Who is ready? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=120.72s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=121.72s)]
*  Who is ready? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=146.16s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=149.84s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=151.52s)]
*  But we need it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=154.08s)]
*  Elbows up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=155.36s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=156.36s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=159.72s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=161.44s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=162.52s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=168.04s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=170.28s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=174.04s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=176.4s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=181.32s)]
*  in our shared values. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=189.12s)]
*  This, yeah. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=191.56s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=194.52s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=206.04s)]
*  We need to come together. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=211.36s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=212.96s)]
*  We need to come together. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=215.28s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=216.28s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=218.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=223.92s)]
*  En français, même en français. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=226.72s)]
*  Se battre, protéger, bâtir, c'est ça. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=234.48s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=237.32s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=243.72s)]
*  Minimum in the United States. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=244.72s)]
*  They asked for it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=248.16s)]
*  They're getting it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=249.16s)]
*  We need to protect. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=250.64000000000001s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=252.72s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=260.72s)]
*  Pierre Pauly have pocketed all the money. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=263.72s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=267.48s)]
*  Above all, above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=297.6s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=305.8s)]
*  Some big changes. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=308.56s)]
*  And I'm ready to make them. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=309.56s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=311.84000000000003s)]
*  You can probably tell. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=314.88s)]
*  I am not a career politician. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=315.88s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=318.18s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=322.20000000000005s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=326.04s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=331.48s)]
*  Homes, oh, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey, homes have become too expensive. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=337.0s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them and we have set out a strategy to build twice as many [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=343.16s)]
*  homes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  Half a million homes a year using B.C. technology, B.C. skilled trays and B.C. lumber. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=350.64s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=366.23999999999995s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=373.0s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=378.28s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=379.4s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=380.4s)]
*  but it was too divisive, too divisive. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=389.84s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=392.44s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=395.84s)]
*  Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a liter at [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=400.12s)]
*  the pump. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=405.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=406.0s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=407.96s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=411.64s)]
*  And I'm going to take some of these. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=417.48s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=420.48s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=425.24s)]
*  can benefit. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=431.92s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=434.56s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=441.72s)]
*  are less dependent on the United States. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=450.96s)]
*  New relations, EU less dependent on the U.S. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=454.48s)]
*  We are Canada. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=462.48s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=464.72s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends, we've got others. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=466.92s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=468.92s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=474.36s)]
*  cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the premiers [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=484.52s)]
*  to Ottawa. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=494.91999999999996s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=496.79999999999995s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the premiers agreed [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=503.8s)]
*  on anything? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=515.6s)]
*  Like anything. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=516.6s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=517.6s)]
*  But if that's what it takes. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=523.32s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=524.72s)]
*  And my government will do its bit. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=529.4s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st, free [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=534.8s)]
*  trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=541.68s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=549.68s)]
*  more than Pierre Poliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=556.04s)]
*  Now, and that's it. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=564.04s)]
*  If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=568.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=572.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=573.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=574.56s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=575.56s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=577.12s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=578.12s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=580.9599999999999s)]
*  have a strong mandate. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=587.06s)]
*  That's what we need. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=590.06s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=594.56s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=604.56s)]
*  Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=612.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=624.56s)]
*  That's the answer, Donald. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=626.56s)]
*  That will never happen. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=627.56s)]
*  Ever. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=630.56s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=634.56s)]
*  They're not going to make it. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=637.56s)]
*  They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=638.56s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=641.56s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=643.56s)]
*  I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=645.56s)]
*  betrayal. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=650.68s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=653.12s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=658.12s)]
*  And we have to take care of each other. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=661.34s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=665.34s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=675.34s)]
*  But Canada is strong. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=678.34s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=681.22s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=687.22s)]
*  in hockey, we will win. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=696.22s)]
*  We will win. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=704.22s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=707.1s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=715.1s)]
*  ice. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=719.46s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=720.94s)]
*  And what they stressed was what my... [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=723.62s)]
*  I'm talking about my... [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=730.02s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=732.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=736.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=742.78s)]
*  The lessons, they stress the importance. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=745.78s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=750.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=754.3399999999999s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=764.3399999999999s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=768.8399999999999s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=772.16s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=774.86s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=776.9s)]
*  get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=783.5799999999999s)]
*  Right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=788.5799999999999s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=789.5799999999999s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=791.5799999999999s)]
*  But these are... [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=793.5799999999999s)]
*  These are Surrey values. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=797.5799999999999s)]
*  These are Canadian values. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=800.5799999999999s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=802.5799999999999s)]
*  I took them with me. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=804.5799999999999s)]
*  And today... [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=813.5799999999999s)]
*  And today I'm using this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=817.5799999999999s)]
*  And today I'm using this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=817.66s)]
*  to face President Trump and build a renewed economy [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=819.66s)]
*  where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=823.66s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=843.66s)]
*  Because... [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=847.66s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=849.66s)]
*  Cut. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=851.66s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=852.66s)]
*  I know. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=853.66s)]
*  I don't get it either. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=854.66s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=855.66s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=856.66s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=860.66s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=864.66s)]
*  despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=872.14s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=876.14s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=878.14s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=882.14s)]
*  but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=886.14s)]
*  I say... [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=894.14s)]
*  I say so. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=895.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=897.14s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever... [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=898.14s)]
*  We need solutions, not slogans. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=901.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=904.62s)]
*  We need... [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=905.62s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=906.62s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=910.62s)]
*  Action... [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=913.62s)]
*  We need... [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=914.62s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=915.62s)]
*  It's hard. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=916.62s)]
*  Because... [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=918.62s)]
*  Because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=919.62s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=928.1s)]
*  Negativity won't lower the price of the stock. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=932.1s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=937.1s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=942.1s)]
*  it's not going to win a trade war, it will not make Canada strong. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=946.1s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the U.S. with this politics, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=951.1s)]
*  is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=955.58s)]
*  Resist! [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=958.58s)]
*  We... [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=959.58s)]
*  Resist. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=960.58s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=961.58s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=962.58s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=963.58s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=965.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=968.58s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=972.58s)]
*  You know what? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=975.58s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, look to British Columbia, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=978.58s)]
*  it's our strength that they want. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=984.0600000000001s)]
*  They want our resources. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=986.0600000000001s)]
*  They want our water. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=989.0600000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=991.0600000000001s)]
*  They want our land. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=992.0600000000001s)]
*  They want our country. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=993.0600000000001s)]
*  They want our country. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=995.0600000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=997.0600000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=998.0600000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=999.0600000000001s)]
*  Never. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1000.0600000000001s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1001.0600000000001s)]
*  But most fundamentally, because Canada is not America. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1004.0600000000001s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1010.0600000000001s)]
*  America. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1014.0600000000001s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1019.0600000000001s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1021.0600000000001s)]
*  Look at the diversity. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1023.0600000000001s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1024.06s)]
*  Look at this room. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1025.06s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1026.06s)]
*  The diversity. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1028.06s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1029.06s)]
*  You know, in the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1033.06s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1040.54s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1052.54s)]
*  We don't recognize Indigenous peoples. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1055.54s)]
*  And there will never be rights for the French language. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1058.54s)]
*  The United States are not Canada. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1063.54s)]
*  And Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1067.02s)]
*  So, having solved that, what do we do? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1082.02s)]
*  So what do we do now? [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1089.02s)]
*  Fight. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1090.02s)]
*  Fight. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1091.02s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1092.5s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1096.5s)]
*  best. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1102.5s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1103.5s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1109.5s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1115.5s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1118.5s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1122.5s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1124.5s)]
*  You're close. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1126.5s)]
*  You're close. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1127.5s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1134.5s)]
*  No. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1139.5s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1141.5s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1147.98s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1158.98s)]
*  Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1164.82s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1172.82s)]
*  It took me, it took me three weeks. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1176.1399999999999s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple of forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1179.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1183.1399999999999s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1185.1399999999999s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1195.1399999999999s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1202.46s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1212.46s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1219.46s)]
*  in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1224.46s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1229.78s)]
*  we all feel. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1234.94s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1236.94s)]
*  face and overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1242.66s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1249.9s)]
*  And government needs, government needs, government needs to step up, government needs to step [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1255.3400000000001s)]
*  up, government needs to step up and provide direction to catalyze action and drive investment. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1276.82s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1289.82s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1301.3s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. We got to start by making, making the government [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1306.3s)]
*  spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1313.3s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1318.3s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1325.78s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1332.78s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super power, to create [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1343.78s)]
*  a career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1352.26s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. Our plan will fight back against President Trump's [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1365.26s)]
*  trade war, and it will usher in a new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1374.1s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1380.16s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1388.16s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1398.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1406.16s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1411.16s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre-Paul Liev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1419.16s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1427.16s)]
*  Very subtle, that. That's the big issue of our day. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1433.16s)]
*  I know the world's superpower is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1439.16s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1446.16s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1449.16s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1456.16s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1463.16s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1469.16s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1480.16s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1491.16s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way. $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1500.16s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1510.16s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. And I've managed crises before. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1515.16s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1527.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1532.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1543.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1551.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1558.16s)]
*  And to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1572.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe what they're saying. Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1578.16s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1591.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1594.16s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1598.16s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1604.16s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1615.16s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. And we should. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1622.16s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1643.16s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1647.16s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1662.16s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1668.16s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1677.16s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1683.16s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1693.16s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1701.16s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1704.16s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1720.16s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1729.16s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1735.16s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1747.16s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1754.16s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1758.16s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1771.16s)]
*  That is what that states. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1779.16s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1783.16s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1794.16s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1803.16s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1811.16s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1822.16s)]
*  Canada, Canada has given me everything. My family, my education, and my values. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1829.16s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1838.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an oiler's sweater up there. I know that's dangerous to say. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1843.16s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1863.16s)]
*  It's not. Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1866.16s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1871.16s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1881.16s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1887.16s)]
*  A better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1896.16s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1900.16s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1912.16s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1917.16s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. And it means to vote Liberal. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1921.16s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1926.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1932.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1938.16s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1945.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1948.16s)]
*  Alright. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1978.16s)]
*  Hello Surrey. Hello Cloverdale. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1986.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you Diana. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1991.16s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=1995.16s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2001.16s)]
*  Trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2005.16s)]
*  Commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2010.16s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2014.16s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2019.16s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2023.16s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2030.16s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2048.16s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2069.16s)]
*  Okay, with this room I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2089.16s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2094.16s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2097.16s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. Keep going. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2100.16s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2103.16s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2111.16s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2117.16s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2119.16s)]
*  This, yeah. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2131.16s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. Serious leadership and a united country. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2134.16s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2152.16s)]
*  We need to come together, and I saw a sign that said this, we need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2156.16s)]
*  There it is. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2169.16s)]
*  In French, even in French. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2171.16s)]
*  To protect and build, that's it. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2175.16s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2178.16s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2187.16s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2191.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliet pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2206.16s)]
*  And above all. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2212.16s)]
*  Above all. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2213.16s)]
*  Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2215.16s)]
*  Above all. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2223.16s)]
*  Above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2227.16s)]
*  Now. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2238.16s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2243.16s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. Some big changes. And I'm ready to make them. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2246.16s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2253.16s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2259.16s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2262.16s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2267.16s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2269.16s)]
*  Homes. Boy, I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. Homes have become too expensive. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2278.16s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2284.16s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2291.16s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2299.16s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2314.16s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2320.16s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. The BC government followed up. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2332.16s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2340.16s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2347.16s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2358.16s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health system so that 5 million more Canadians have benefited. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2364.16s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access dental care. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2375.16s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2378.16s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2395.16s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2398.16s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2409.16s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2414.16s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2429.16s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2437.16s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2450.16s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2458.16s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its best. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2465.16s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2476.16s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2489.16s)]
*  Now, and that's if, if he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2506.16s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2515.16s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2521.16s)]
*  That's what we need. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2531.16s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2535.16s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2545.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2565.16s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2576.16s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2582.16s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2585.16s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2593.16s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. That's our responsibility. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2598.16s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2615.16s)]
*  Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2620.16s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2628.16s)]
*  We will win. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2645.16s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2648.16s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2656.16s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was... [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2661.16s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2669.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2677.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2684.16s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2687.16s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2692.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2695.16s)]
*  Barney! Barney! Barney! Barney! [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2697.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2702.16s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2705.16s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2709.16s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2713.16s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2718.16s)]
*  this being Canada, stay humble. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2727.16s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the US. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2730.16s)]
*  But these are... [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2734.16s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2737.16s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2744.16s)]
*  I relied on these values when I went to church in Canada and abroad. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2747.16s)]
*  And today... [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2753.16s)]
*  And today I rely on these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2756.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2773.16s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2776.16s)]
*  Because... [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2788.16s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. Cut. Cut. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2790.16s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2793.16s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2797.16s)]
*  I have though seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2800.16s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2817.16s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2819.16s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2822.16s)]
*  I say so. Yeah. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2835.16s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2838.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2845.16s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2847.16s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2851.16s)]
*  We need... [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2855.16s)]
*  That's right. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2858.16s)]
*  Because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2860.16s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2868.16s)]
*  Negativity won't lower the price of the stock. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2873.16s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2877.16s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. It's not going to pay the rent. It's not going to win a trade war. It will not make Canada strong. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2883.16s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2892.16s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2900.16s)]
*  They will get weaker. We will get stronger. We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2904.16s)]
*  You know what? [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2916.16s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2919.16s)]
*  They want our resources. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2927.16s)]
*  They want our water. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2929.16s)]
*  That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2931.16s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2936.16s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2942.16s)]
*  But most fundamentally, because Canada is not America. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2945.16s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2952.16s)]
*  America. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2954.16s)]
*  America. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2955.16s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2959.16s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2962.16s)]
*  We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2967.16s)]
*  You know, in the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2974.16s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2982.16s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize Indigenous peoples. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=2993.16s)]
*  And there will never be rights for French. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3001.16s)]
*  The United States are not Canada. And Canada will never ever be part of America. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3005.16s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3012.16s)]
*  In any way, shape or form. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3015.16s)]
*  So, having solved that. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3020.16s)]
*  He doesn't like that. I know. So what do we do? So what do we do now? [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3027.16s)]
*  Fight. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3032.16s)]
*  First, we have to manage through this crisis. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3034.16s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3037.16s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3045.16s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3050.16s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3056.16s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3060.16s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3063.16s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3074.16s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3080.16s)]
*  Who copies his ideas and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3086.16s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3098.16s)]
*  956 days in counting. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3112.16s)]
*  It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3116.16s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple of forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3120.16s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3124.16s)]
*  So we are, we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3128.16s)]
*  We can control our destiny. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3142.16s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3146.16s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3152.16s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetimes, to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3160.16s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3170.16s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3177.16s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3184.16s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3190.16s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3195.16s)]
*  Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3206.16s)]
*  Government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3219.16s)]
*  To catalyze action and drive investment. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3225.16s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3231.16s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3243.16s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. We got to start by making, making the government spend less. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3248.16s)]
*  So that Canadians can invest more. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3256.16s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3260.16s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3267.16s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3274.16s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3277.16s)]
*  To make Canada a super power, to create a good career in specialized jobs. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3281.16s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3289.16s)]
*  Our plan. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3297.16s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3298.16s)]
*  Our plan. There was a lot in that. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3305.16s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3310.16s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3316.16s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3320.16s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3329.16s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3338.16s)]
*  Because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3341.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing actually. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3346.16s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it actually. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3351.16s)]
*  Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3355.16s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Paulièvre has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3359.16s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3367.16s)]
*  That's very subtle that. That's the big issue of our day. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3373.16s)]
*  I know the world's super powers attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3379.16s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3386.16s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3389.16s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy and an economy that works for everyone. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3396.16s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3403.16s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3409.16s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3415.16s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3426.16s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3433.16s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1 by the way, $825 for hard working Canadians. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3442.16s)]
*  If you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3448.16s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3456.16s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3461.16s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3466.16s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3469.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3473.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3481.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3489.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3496.16s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3503.16s)]
*  And to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3508.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to stand up to the president. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3513.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe what they're saying. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3520.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3522.16s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3532.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3535.16s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3539.16s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3542.16s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3545.16s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3556.16s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3563.16s)]
*  And we should. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3579.16s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3583.16s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3588.16s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3603.16s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3609.16s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3618.16s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3624.16s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3634.16s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3642.16s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3645.16s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3658.16s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3670.16s)]
*  But you know what struck me is that many of these cards, the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3676.16s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3688.16s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3695.16s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3699.16s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3712.16s)]
*  That is what that states. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3720.16s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3726.16s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3736.16s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3745.16s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3756.16s)]
*  Canada has given me everything. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3769.16s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3773.16s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3778.16s)]
*  Wow. Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know that's dangerous to say. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3783.16s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes. Soon, soon. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3793.16s)]
*  Look, I'm going to say that Canada is a safe country. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3800.16s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes. Soon, soon. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3805.16s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3812.16s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3822.16s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3828.16s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3841.16s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3850.16s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. It means talking to your friends and families. And it means to vote Liberal. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3857.16s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. took the side of the next Prime Minister. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3867.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3873.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3879.16s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. Thank you very much. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3886.16s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3891.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3902.16s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello Cloverdale. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3927.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Diana. Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3932.16s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3941.16s)]
*  Commitment and compassion, as in everything that she does. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3951.16s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3955.16s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3959.16s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3963.16s)]
*  And it's great. It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3971.16s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=3988.16s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4009.16s)]
*  Okay. With this room, I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4024.16s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. And their most steadfast ally. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4034.16s)]
*  Boo indeed. Exactly. Keep going. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4040.16s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4044.16s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4051.16s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4056.16s)]
*  This, yeah. This, this, this is time for serious leadership. Serious leadership and a united country. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4071.16s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together. But we need to act. We need to come together. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4092.16s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4097.16s)]
*  There it is. En français. Même en français. Se battre, protéger, bâtir. C'est ça. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4109.16s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4118.16s)]
*  Minimum. They asked for it. They're getting it. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4125.16s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4131.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliet pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4145.16s)]
*  And above all, above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4149.16s)]
*  Above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4167.16s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes. Some big changes. And I'm ready to make them. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4183.16s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. But I am a pragmatist. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4192.16s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. Something's not working, I change it. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4202.16s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4212.16s)]
*  Homes, oh I don't need to tell you this here, sorry. Homes have become too expensive. So we are cutting taxes on them. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4219.16s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. We're going to build half a million homes a year using B.C. technology, B.C. skilled trays and B.C. lumber. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4227.16s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4239.16s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4258.16s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4261.16s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a liter at the pump. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4277.16s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4286.16s)]
*  Not your tax dollars. Them. [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4299.16s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4303.16s)]
*  Five million more Canadians access to dental care. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4316.16s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4319.16s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the U.S. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4336.16s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4339.16s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4350.16s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4354.16s)]
*  Unique. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4365.16s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4369.16s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4378.16s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4384.16s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4398.16s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4406.16s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4412.16s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Poliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4425.16s)]
*  And that's if he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4443.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4454.16s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4461.16s)]
*  That's what we need. Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4470.16s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4483.16s)]
*  once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4493.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4506.16s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4512.16s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4522.16s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4533.16s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. That's our responsibility. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4538.16s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops a gun. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4556.16s)]
*  And when someone else drops the gloves. And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4568.16s)]
*  We will win. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4586.16s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4589.16s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. My parents were teachers. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4596.16s)]
*  And what they stressed was what my... I'm talking about my parents. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4604.16s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4618.16s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. They stress the importance. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4626.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4636.16s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. The importance of supporting our community. The importance of caring for other people. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4638.16s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4657.16s)]
*  And this being Canada, stay humble. Right? They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4668.16s)]
*  But these are... these are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4676.16s)]
*  And today, I have supported these values when I managed crises in Canada and abroad. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4687.16s)]
*  And today, I have supported them to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4695.16s)]
*  That's wonderful, me. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4713.16s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4717.16s)]
*  Because... cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4729.16s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4738.16s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4757.16s)]
*  And it's a kind of... it's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4759.16s)]
*  Say... say so. Yeah. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4776.16s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. Yeah. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4779.16s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. And we need action, not anger. Action. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4786.16s)]
*  Yeah, we need... that's right. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4796.16s)]
*  That's right. Because... because... because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4799.16s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4809.16s)]
*  Negativity won't lower the price of the stock. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4814.16s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4819.16s)]
*  That's right, fool. Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent, it's not going to win a trade war, it will not make Canada strong. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4823.16s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4833.16s)]
*  We... resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. They will get weaker, we will get stronger, we will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4841.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4853.16s)]
*  You know what? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4857.16s)]
*  When the Americans look... look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4860.16s)]
*  They want our resources. They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4868.16s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4877.16s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4883.16s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. Canada is not America. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4886.16s)]
*  America. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4895.16s)]
*  America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4900.16s)]
*  The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4909.16s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4915.16s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4923.16s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize indigenous peoples. And there will never be a right for French. [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4927.16s)]
*  The United States is not Canada and Canada will never ever be part of America. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4937.16s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4943.16s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4949.16s)]
*  So, having solved that, what do we do? So what do we do now? Fight. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4961.16s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4973.16s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4985.16s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4991.16s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=4997.16s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5000.16s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5004.16s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Poliev. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5015.16s)]
*  No, it's not Pierre Poliev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5020.16s)]
*  That's not Pierre Poliev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5035.16s)]
*  956 days and counting. It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5049.16s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, wasn't that hard? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5057.16s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5060.16s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5070.16s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5078.16s)]
*  We can and we will control our economic destiny. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5082.16s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5087.16s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5094.16s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5101.16s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5110.16s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5118.16s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5125.16s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5131.16s)]
*  And government needs, government needs, government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5135.16s)]
*  To catalyze action and drive investment. [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5165.16s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5171.16s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5182.16s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. We've got to start by making, making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5187.16s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5199.16s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5205.16s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes. To make Canada a super powerhouse. To create a career in specialized jobs. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5217.16s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5238.16s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5245.16s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war. And it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5250.16s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5262.16s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5268.16s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. Because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5278.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing actually. Same thing. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5287.16s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it actually. Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5293.16s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5300.16s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. Very subtle that. That's the big issue of our day. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5308.16s)]
*  I know the world's superpowers attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. We'll deal with the Americans. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5319.16s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5329.16s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5337.16s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5343.16s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5350.16s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5361.16s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5368.16s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working families. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5377.16s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working families. [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5383.16s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5392.16s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. And I've managed crises before. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5397.16s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5408.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5415.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5425.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5430.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5445.16s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5457.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5462.16s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5473.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5475.16s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5479.16s)]
*  No. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what will make Canada strong. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5486.16s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5497.16s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. And we should. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5503.16s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5515.16s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5520.16s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5531.16s)]
*  And we care about the people who are in the middle of the world. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5537.16s)]
*  And I want to give an example. From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5541.16s)]
*  And he said, you know, I'm going to be a teacher in Ontario. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5549.16s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to be a teacher in Ontario. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5553.16s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to be a teacher in Ontario. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5557.16s)]
*  And he said, I'm going to be a teacher in Ontario. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5561.16s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5564.16s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5574.16s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5579.16s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5582.16s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5586.16s)]
*  These kids, these kids like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5602.16s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5610.16s)]
*  But you know what struck me is that many of these cards, the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5616.16s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5628.16s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5633.16s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5636.16s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5641.16s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5653.16s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5666.16s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5677.16s)]
*  And not, not because, not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5686.16s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5696.16s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5704.16s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5713.16s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5718.16s)]
*  Wow. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5733.16s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5735.16s)]
*  I'm sorry, I know that's, I know that's dangerous to say. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5740.16s)]
*  Good luck. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5744.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5746.16s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5748.16s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness for, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5751.16s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5761.16s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5765.16s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5767.16s)]
*  But to use, to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5780.16s)]
*  Right? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5790.16s)]
*  You know what to do. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5792.16s)]
*  You know what to do. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5793.16s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5795.16s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5798.16s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5801.16s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5803.16s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5805.16s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5808.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5814.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5819.16s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5827.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5830.16s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5832.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5849.16s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5865.16s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5870.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5872.16s)]
*  Thank you, Diana. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5874.16s)]
*  Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5875.16s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5882.16s)]
*  Commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5892.16s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5896.16s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5899.16s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5901.16s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5903.16s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5905.16s)]
*  And it's great. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5913.16s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5915.16s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5935.16s)]
*  Who's ready? [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5940.16s)]
*  Who is ready? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5943.16s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5945.16s)]
*  Who is ready? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5951.16s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5958.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5965.16s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5972.16s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5974.16s)]
*  But we need it. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5976.16s)]
*  Elbows up. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5978.16s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5980.16s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5982.16s)]
*  Keep going. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5984.16s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5986.16s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5991.16s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5992.16s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5996.16s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=5998.16s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6001.16s)]
*  This, yeah. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6013.16s)]
*  This. [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6015.16s)]
*  This. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6016.16s)]
*  This. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6021.16s)]
*  This is time for serious leadership. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6023.16s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6028.16s)]
*  We need to come together. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6033.16s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6035.16s)]
*  We need to come together. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6038.16s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6040.16s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6042.16s)]
*  There it is. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6046.16s)]
*  There it is. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6048.16s)]
*  En français, même en français. [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6050.16s)]
*  Se battre pour te protéger et bâtir, c'est ça. [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6053.16s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6056.16s)]
*  Minimum in France. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6064.16s)]
*  They asked for it. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6066.16s)]
*  They're getting it. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6068.16s)]
*  We need to protect. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6070.16s)]
*  We need to protect. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6072.16s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6073.16s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6082.16s)]
*  Pierre Polly have pocketed all the money. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6084.16s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6090.16s)]
*  And above all. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6092.16s)]
*  And above all. [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6094.16s)]
*  Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? Are we? [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6096.16s)]
*  Above all. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6104.16s)]
*  Above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6108.16s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6117.16s)]
*  Now. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6119.16s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6124.16s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6127.16s)]
*  Some big changes. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6130.16s)]
*  And I'm ready to make them. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6131.16s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6134.16s)]
*  You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6137.16s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6140.16s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6143.16s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6148.16s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6149.16s)]
*  Homes. Boy, I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6159.16s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6163.16s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6165.16s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6168.16s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6172.16s)]
*  BC skilled trays. [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6177.16s)]
*  BC lumber. [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6179.16s)]
*  We saw. [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6181.16s)]
*  We saw. [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6187.16s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6189.16s)]
*  What was that doing? [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6194.16s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6196.16s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6198.16s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6200.16s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[01:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6202.16s)]
*  We saw. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6204.16s)]
*  You know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6205.16s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6214.16s)]
*  The BC government followed up. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6218.16s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6222.16s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6228.16s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6230.16s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6233.16s)]
*  Not your tax dollars. Them. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6240.16s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6246.16s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6256.16s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6263.16s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6276.16s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6284.16s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6288.16s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6291.16s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6293.16s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6310.16s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6318.16s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6331.16s)]
*  Anything. Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. Fair. But if that's what it takes. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6339.16s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its best. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6346.16s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6357.16s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Poliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6366.16s)]
*  And that's if he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6384.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6395.16s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6402.16s)]
*  That's what we need. Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6411.16s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can have a better future. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6424.16s)]
*  America can own us. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6441.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6447.16s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6457.16s)]
*  Turn America to the border. But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6463.16s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6474.16s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. That's our responsibility. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6480.16s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6493.16s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6503.16s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6510.16s)]
*  We will win. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6522.16s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6530.16s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6537.16s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was... [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6543.16s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6549.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6565.16s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. They stress the importance. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6567.16s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6579.16s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. The importance of caring for other people. [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6590.16s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6597.16s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6599.16s)]
*  And this being Canada, stay humble. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6607.16s)]
*  I don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6611.16s)]
*  But these are... these are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6615.16s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[01:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6625.16s)]
*  I took them with me. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6628.16s)]
*  and I have managed crises in Canada and abroad. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6629.16s)]
*  And today, I am supporting them to face President Trump [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6635.16s)]
*  and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6644.16s)]
*  in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6650.16s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6654.16s)]
*  this relying on the values, [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6661.16s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6664.16s)]
*  Because... cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6669.16s)]
*  I know, I know, I don't get it either. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6674.16s)]
*  I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6677.16s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6679.16s)]
*  because there is a type of lifelong politician [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6686.16s)]
*  who worships at the altar of the free market [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6690.16s)]
*  despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6693.16s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6698.16s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6700.16s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6703.16s)]
*  but relies on his reflex to always cut, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6708.16s)]
*  to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6712.16s)]
*  Let me say... let me say so. Yeah. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6716.16s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6720.16s)]
*  we need solutions, not slogans. Yeah. [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6723.16s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6728.16s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. Action. [[01:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6732.16s)]
*  OK, we need... that's right. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6737.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6739.16s)]
*  Because... because... because negativity [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6741.16s)]
*  will not allow us to win a trade war. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6745.16s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[01:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6750.16s)]
*  Negativity will not lower the price of the stock. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6755.16s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6760.16s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, [[01:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6765.16s)]
*  it's not going to pay the rent, [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6767.16s)]
*  it's not going to win a trade war, [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6769.16s)]
*  it will not make Canada strong. [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6771.16s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6773.16s)]
*  it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[01:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6777.16s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6781.16s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6784.16s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger, [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6786.16s)]
*  we will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6788.16s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6791.16s)]
*  You know what? [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6798.16s)]
*  When the Americans look... look to Canada, [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6801.16s)]
*  look to British Columbia, [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6804.16s)]
*  it's our strength that they want. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6806.16s)]
*  They want our resources. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6808.16s)]
*  They want our water. That's right. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6811.16s)]
*  They want our land. They want our country. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6814.16s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6818.16s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6824.16s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6827.16s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6833.16s)]
*  America. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6836.16s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6841.16s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6844.16s)]
*  Canadians, look at this room. [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6847.16s)]
*  We're all Canadians. The diversity. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6849.16s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6852.16s)]
*  You know, in the United States, [[01:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6856.16s)]
*  healthcare is a big business. [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6860.16s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6864.16s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6869.16s)]
*  We don't recognize indigenous peoples. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6874.16s)]
*  And there will never be rights for French. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6878.16s)]
*  The United States is not Canada, [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6882.16s)]
*  and Canada will never be part of America. [[01:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6885.16s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6888.16s)]
*  in any way, shape or form. [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6891.16s)]
*  So, having solved that, [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6894.16s)]
*  I know, so what do we do? [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6899.16s)]
*  So what do we do now? Fight. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6902.16s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6905.16s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6909.16s)]
*  you have to prepare for the worst. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6912.16s)]
*  And that's what we're going to do. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6915.16s)]
*  We're going to do what we can. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6918.16s)]
*  And in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6921.16s)]
*  not hope for the best. [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6924.16s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6927.16s)]
*  and what you can't. [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6930.16s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6933.16s)]
*  we can't change President Trump. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6936.16s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6939.16s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6942.16s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6945.16s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6948.16s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not... [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6956.16s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6959.16s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Polyev [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6962.16s)]
*  who draws his inspiration from President Trump, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6965.16s)]
*  who copies his ideas, and whose first instinct [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6968.16s)]
*  when our nation was attacked [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6971.16s)]
*  was to call Canada stupid. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6974.16s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6979.16s)]
*  who chooses to be willfully blind [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6982.16s)]
*  to the growing threats facing Canada [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6985.16s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6988.16s)]
*  to get his security clearance. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6991.16s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6994.16s)]
*  It took me three weeks. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=6997.16s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple forms, [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7000.16s)]
*  tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7003.16s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7006.16s)]
*  Seems straight up to me. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7009.16s)]
*  So we are in a situation [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7018.16s)]
*  where, as usual, we are at home. [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7021.16s)]
*  We can control our destiny, economy. [[01:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7024.16s)]
*  We can and we will [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7027.16s)]
*  control our destiny with the right plan. [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7030.16s)]
*  Because in a crisis, [[01:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7033.16s)]
*  plan beats no plan. [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7036.16s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7039.16s)]
*  and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7042.16s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7045.16s)]
*  with overwhelming force. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7048.16s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7051.16s)]
*  that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7054.16s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7057.16s)]
*  to break through the uncertainty [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7060.16s)]
*  that businesses face. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7063.16s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7066.16s)]
*  what the crisis is taking away. [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7069.16s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7072.16s)]
*  and starts to retreat. [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7075.16s)]
*  And government needs... [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7078.16s)]
*  government needs... [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7081.16s)]
*  government needs... [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7084.16s)]
*  Party! Party! Party! [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7087.16s)]
*  Party! Party! [[01:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7090.16s)]
*  Party! Party! [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7093.16s)]
*  Party! Party! [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7096.16s)]
*  Party! Party! [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7099.16s)]
*  Government needs to step up, [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7102.16s)]
*  government needs to step up and provide direction. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7105.16s)]
*  To catalyze action. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7108.16s)]
*  And drive investment. [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7111.16s)]
*  That is what our plan... [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7114.16s)]
*  that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7117.16s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? [[01:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7120.16s)]
*  How do we do that? [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7123.16s)]
*  We start... [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7126.16s)]
*  we got to start at home. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7129.16s)]
*  We've got to start by making the government spend less [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7132.16s)]
*  so that Canadians can invest more. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7135.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7138.16s)]
*  And we will cut out government waste. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7141.16s)]
*  But the core of our plan... [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7144.16s)]
*  the core of our plan... [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7147.16s)]
*  you guessed it, is to build. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7150.16s)]
*  Build, baby, build. [[01:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7153.16s)]
*  That is what we're going to do. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7156.16s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of housing. [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7162.16s)]
*  To make Canada a super-powerful energy company. [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7165.16s)]
*  To create a career in specialized jobs. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7168.16s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7171.16s)]
*  With new reliable partners around the world. [[01:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7174.16s)]
*  Our plan. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7177.16s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7180.16s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7183.16s)]
*  President Trump's trade war. [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7186.16s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7189.16s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment. [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7192.16s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7195.16s)]
*  Of jobs and growth. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7198.16s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7201.16s)]
*  for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7204.16s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7207.16s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7210.16s)]
*  we're making Canada strong together. [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7213.16s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7216.16s)]
*  Because the Conservatives finally [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7219.16s)]
*  released their platform yesterday. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7222.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7225.16s)]
*  I thought the same thing, actually. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7228.16s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[02:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7231.16s)]
*  Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7234.16s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7237.16s)]
*  that once again Pierre-Paul Liev has no plan [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7240.16s)]
*  to stand up to President Trump. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7243.16s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7246.16s)]
*  as Canada. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7249.16s)]
*  That's very clever. That's very subtle. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7252.16s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7255.16s)]
*  I know the world's super powers [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7258.16s)]
*  attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7261.16s)]
*  We'll deal with the Americans. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7264.16s)]
*  He's offering Canadians [[02:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7267.16s)]
*  a fantasy of fiscal tricks [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7270.16s)]
*  and phantom growth. [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7273.16s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7276.16s)]
*  to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7279.16s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7282.16s)]
*  in the fight against climate change. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7285.16s)]
*  He wants to cut [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7288.16s)]
*  what Canadians value. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7291.16s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharmacare, [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7294.16s)]
*  treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[02:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7297.16s)]
*  He has a [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7300.16s)]
*  bring it home tax cut [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7303.16s)]
*  that is never home. [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7306.16s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7309.16s)]
*  after President Trump [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7312.16s)]
*  is due to leave office. [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7315.16s)]
*  It's not a solution. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7318.16s)]
*  Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7321.16s)]
*  for hardworking Canadians. [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7324.16s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7327.16s)]
*  you do something, you do it right away. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7330.16s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7333.16s)]
*  I've managed budgets before. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7336.16s)]
*  I've managed economy. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7339.16s)]
*  I've managed economies before. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7342.16s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7345.16s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7348.16s)]
*  you don't cut back. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7351.16s)]
*  A crisis, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7354.16s)]
*  a crisis is a time for bold action, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7357.16s)]
*  not tired ideology. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7360.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7363.16s)]
*  not to sow division. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7366.16s)]
*  A crisis, [[02:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7369.16s)]
*  a crisis is a time [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7372.16s)]
*  for experience, not experiments. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7375.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7378.16s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7382.16s)]
*  and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7385.16s)]
*  and he has some allies in Canada, [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7388.16s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7391.16s)]
*  to President Trump. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7394.16s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7397.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7400.16s)]
*  to defend ourselves is to leave [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7403.16s)]
*  every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7406.16s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7409.16s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7412.16s)]
*  go along to get along, that the way to get through this crisis [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7415.16s)]
*  is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7418.16s)]
*  what they want and hope for the best. [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7421.16s)]
*  No, no. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7424.16s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7427.16s)]
*  That is not, that is not what makes Canada strong. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7430.16s)]
*  I know, we know, [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7433.16s)]
*  we can give ourselves far more [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7436.16s)]
*  than the Americans can ever take away. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7439.16s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7448.16s)]
*  as America retreats from the world, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7451.16s)]
*  Canada can lead it. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7454.16s)]
*  And we should. [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7457.16s)]
*  The choice, [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7461.16s)]
*  I think the choice in this election could not be clear. [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7464.16s)]
*  Now, [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7467.16s)]
*  I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7470.16s)]
*  I want to say a few words about [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7473.16s)]
*  why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7476.16s)]
*  care about building a strong economy. [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7479.16s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7482.16s)]
*  It's because we care about people. [[02:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7485.16s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7488.16s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7491.16s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7500.16s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7503.16s)]
*  who told me about a routine assignment [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7506.16s)]
*  that she'd given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7509.16s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7512.16s)]
*  their dreams for Canada. [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7515.16s)]
*  And I read the papers that they'd written. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7518.16s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7521.16s)]
*  Others, [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7524.16s)]
*  yeah, be good, yeah. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7527.16s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7530.16s)]
*  or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7533.16s)]
*  dignity, and respect. [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7536.16s)]
*  These kids, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7539.16s)]
*  these kids, like kids here, [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7542.16s)]
*  kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7545.16s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7548.16s)]
*  for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7551.16s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7554.16s)]
*  Is that many of these cards, [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7557.16s)]
*  the kids wrote about tariffs [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7560.16s)]
*  and threats to our sovereignty. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7563.16s)]
*  And those are words [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7566.16s)]
*  I had not met at their age. [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7569.16s)]
*  And those are words I did not know when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7572.16s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7575.16s)]
*  I dream of a safe, [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7578.16s)]
*  a kind, and a clean Canada. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7581.16s)]
*  Okay? [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7584.16s)]
*  And then the child goes on. [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7587.16s)]
*  And then the child goes on. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7590.16s)]
*  Goes on and says, [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7593.16s)]
*  a Canada that is not the United States. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7596.16s)]
*  That is what that state. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7599.16s)]
*  You know, [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7602.16s)]
*  our children, our children should be able to dream [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7605.16s)]
*  about a positive future, [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7608.16s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7611.16s)]
*  So, well, I know these times are unsettling. [[02:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7614.16s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7617.16s)]
*  that future, the future they deserve. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7620.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7623.16s)]
*  And not because, [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7626.16s)]
*  not because it's easy, [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7629.16s)]
*  not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7632.16s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7635.16s)]
*  You know. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7638.16s)]
*  Canada, [[02:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7641.16s)]
*  Canada, [[02:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7644.16s)]
*  Canada, [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7647.16s)]
*  Canada has given me everything. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7650.16s)]
*  My family, my education, [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7653.16s)]
*  and my values. [[02:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7656.16s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7659.16s)]
*  to Canada. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7662.16s)]
*  Applause. [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7665.16s)]
*  Applause. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7668.16s)]
*  Wow. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7671.16s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7674.16s)]
*  because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7677.16s)]
*  I'm sorry. I know that's dangerous to say. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7680.16s)]
*  Good luck. [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7683.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7686.16s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7689.16s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7692.16s)]
*  to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, [[02:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7695.16s)]
*  I need your help. [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7698.16s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7701.16s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7704.16s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7707.16s)]
*  a number of you have already given so much of your time [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7710.16s)]
*  and talents to build a better Surrey, [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7713.16s)]
*  a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7716.16s)]
*  But to use, to use a hockey analogy, [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7719.16s)]
*  there are five minutes left [[02:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7722.16s)]
*  in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup final. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7725.16s)]
*  Applause. [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7728.16s)]
*  You know what to do. [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7731.16s)]
*  It's time to leave everything on the ice. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7734.16s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7737.16s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7740.16s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7743.16s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7746.16s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. [[02:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7749.16s)]
*  could decide the next Prime Minister. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7752.16s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7755.16s)]
*  that we share. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7758.16s)]
*  To build a united Canada that works for all, [[02:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7761.16s)]
*  let's build Canada strong. [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7764.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7767.16s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7770.16s)]
*  Applause. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7773.16s)]
*  Cheers and applause. [[02:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7776.16s)]
*  Alright. [[02:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7801.16s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. Thank you. Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7804.16s)]
*  but for all of your work on this campaign. Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7816.38s)]
*  on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7822.8s)]
*  commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. Look, it is fantastic. I've [[02:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7830.24s)]
*  been looking forward to this all week. Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7836.4s)]
*  having me. It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. And it's [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7841.4s)]
*  big. It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7851.32s)]
*  Ottawa to build Canada strong. So, look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7865.4s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7882.84s)]
*  Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? Okay. With this room, I [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7898.8s)]
*  think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. But we need it. Elbows up. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7910.76s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. Boo indeed. Exactly. Keep going. This, you know, it's [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7916.360000000001s)]
*  actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. But it's also our new reality. [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7924.72s)]
*  And we have to deal with this. And we will get through this crisis. We will get through [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7935.08s)]
*  this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7943.0s)]
*  This, this, this, this is time for serious leadership, serious leadership and a united [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7951.84s)]
*  country. We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. We need to come [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7969.52s)]
*  together. And I saw a sign that said this. We need to come together to fight, to protect and [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7976.2s)]
*  to build Canada. There it is. En français. Même en français. Se battre, protéger, bâtir. C'est ça. We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter [[02:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=7981.679999999999s)]
*  tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. Minimum. They asked for it. They're getting it. We need to protect. We [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8000.96s)]
*  need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. Pierre [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8013.36s)]
*  Pauli have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. And above all, above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8026.04s)]
*  build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes, some big [[02:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8053.44s)]
*  changes, and I'm ready to make them. You know, I'm I'm not a career politician, you can probably tell I am not a career politician. But I am a [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8069.2s)]
*  pragmatist. And so and so when I see something that's not working, I change it. Something's not working. And that's and that's exactly what I did as soon as I [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8079.72s)]
*  became Prime Minister. Homes, boy, I don't need to tell you this here and sorry, homes have become too expensive. So we are cutting taxes on them. And we [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8096.16s)]
*  have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays and BC lumber. We saw [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8106.32s)]
*  we saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. We saw, you know, across this [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8128.24s)]
*  country, the consumer carbon tax, look good on paper, but it was too divisive, too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. The BC government followed up. Premier Edie and the BC government [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8144.44s)]
*  followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. Okay. And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. Not your tax dollars, them. [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8162.0s)]
*  Canada plus plus en bénéficier. Five million more Canadians access to dental care. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8192.0s)]
*  Canada. [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8199.0s)]
*  We'll reinforce our commercial relationships with the European Union to keep our exporters less dependent on the United States. [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8203.96s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8214.56s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8222.56s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8226.56s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8229.56s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia, and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8231.56s)]
*  We want to have workers inside our own country. [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8261.56s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[02:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8269.56s)]
*  Anything. Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. [[02:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8277.56s)]
*  But if that's what it takes. [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8283.56s)]
*  The fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8285.56s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8295.56s)]
*  So in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8304.56s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8322.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8332.56s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8339.56s)]
*  That's what we need. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8349.56s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8357.56s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. Once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can live. [[02:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8362.56s)]
*  And he's trying to own us. [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8379.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8385.56s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8395.56s)]
*  Turn them back at the border. [[02:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8401.56s)]
*  You know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[02:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8404.56s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8411.56s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. [[02:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8417.56s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[02:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8425.56s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8434.56s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8440.56s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[02:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8447.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8464.56s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8468.56s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8474.56s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8480.56s)]
*  And what they stressed was what my... [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8482.56s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[02:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8489.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8494.56s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8505.56s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[02:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8511.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8515.56s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8524.56s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8528.56s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8532.56s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8534.56s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly. [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8536.56s)]
*  Be ambitious and, this being Canada, stay humble. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8544.56s)]
*  I don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. [[02:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8549.56s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[02:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8551.56s)]
*  But these are... [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8553.56s)]
*  These are Surrey values. [[02:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8557.56s)]
*  These are Canadian values. [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8559.56s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8563.56s)]
*  I took them with me. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8565.56s)]
*  I relied on these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8566.56s)]
*  And today... [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8574.56s)]
*  And today I rely on them to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8578.56s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values... [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8594.56s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8602.56s)]
*  Because... [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8607.56s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. [[02:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8609.56s)]
*  Cut. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8611.56s)]
*  I know. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8612.56s)]
*  I know. [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8613.56s)]
*  I don't get it either. [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8614.56s)]
*  I don't get it. [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8615.56s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8616.56s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8620.56s)]
*  It's much easier that way. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8636.56s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8638.56s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8641.56s)]
*  And I say... [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8654.56s)]
*  I say so. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8655.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8656.56s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8657.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8664.56s)]
*  We need... [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8665.56s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8666.56s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[02:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8669.56s)]
*  Action. [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8673.56s)]
*  Yeah, we need... [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8674.56s)]
*  That's right. [[02:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8675.56s)]
*  That's right. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8676.56s)]
*  Because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8678.56s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8687.56s)]
*  Negativity won't make the price of the stock price go down. [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8692.56s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8697.56s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8702.56s)]
*  It's not going to pay the rent. [[02:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8705.56s)]
*  It's not going to win a trade war. [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8706.56s)]
*  It will not make Canada strong. [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8708.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the U.S. with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8711.56s)]
*  Resist. [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8718.56s)]
*  We resist. [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8719.56s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8720.56s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8722.56s)]
*  They will get weaker. [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8723.56s)]
*  We will get stronger. [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8724.56s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8725.56s)]
*  That's right. [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8728.56s)]
*  That's right. [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8731.56s)]
*  You know what? [[02:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8735.56s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, they look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8738.56s)]
*  They want our resources. [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8746.56s)]
*  They want our water. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8748.56s)]
*  That's right. [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8750.56s)]
*  They want our land. [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8751.56s)]
*  They want our country. [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8753.56s)]
*  They want our country. [[02:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8755.56s)]
*  Never. [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8756.56s)]
*  Never. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8757.56s)]
*  Never. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8758.56s)]
*  Never. [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8759.56s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8760.56s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8764.56s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8770.56s)]
*  America. [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8772.56s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8774.56s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8779.56s)]
*  Look at the diversity. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8781.56s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8782.56s)]
*  Look at this room. [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8783.56s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8784.56s)]
*  The diversity. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8785.56s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8786.56s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8787.56s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a big business. [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8795.56s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8800.56s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8812.56s)]
*  We don't recognize Indigenous peoples. [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8815.56s)]
*  And there will never be a right for French. [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8819.56s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8824.56s)]
*  And Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8827.56s)]
*  So, having solved that, I know. [[02:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8839.56s)]
*  So what do we do? [[02:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8847.56s)]
*  So what do we do now? [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8849.56s)]
*  Fight. [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8850.56s)]
*  Fight. [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8851.56s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8852.56s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8856.56s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8864.56s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8869.56s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8876.56s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8879.56s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8882.56s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8884.56s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8886.56s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Poliev. [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8894.56s)]
*  No. [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8899.56s)]
*  It's not Pierre Poliev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, [[02:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8901.56s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[02:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8907.56s)]
*  Boo! [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8914.56s)]
*  That's not Pierre Poliev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada [[02:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8917.56s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8925.56s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[02:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8931.56s)]
*  It took me, it took me three weeks. [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8936.56s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple of forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[02:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8939.56s)]
*  I don't know. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8944.56s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8946.56s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8955.56s)]
*  We can control our destiny. [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8962.56s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8965.56s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8972.56s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetimes, [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8979.56s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8984.56s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8989.56s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=8996.56s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9003.56s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[02:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9009.56s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs to step up, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9014.56s)]
*  government needs to step up and provide direction, to catalyze action and drive investment. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9039.56s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[02:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9049.56s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9060.56s)]
*  How do we do that? [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9064.56s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9066.56s)]
*  We've got to start by making, making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9069.56s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[02:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9077.56s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9086.56s)]
*  Build, baby, build. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9092.56s)]
*  That is what we're going to do. [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9095.56s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super power, to create a good career in specialized jobs, [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9096.56s)]
*  to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9116.56s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9124.56s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9129.56s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9140.56s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9149.56s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9151.56s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9158.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. [[02:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9167.56s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9172.56s)]
*  Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. [[02:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9175.56s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre-Paul Liev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[02:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9179.56s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. [[02:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9187.56s)]
*  That's very clever. Very subtle, that. [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9192.56s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9196.56s)]
*  I know the world's superpower is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9198.56s)]
*  We'll deal with the Americans. [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9205.56s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9208.56s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[02:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9215.56s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9222.56s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9228.56s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9234.56s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9245.56s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9251.56s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9261.56s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9270.56s)]
*  Unlike Pierre-Paul Liev, I've managed budgets before. [[02:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9275.56s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9280.56s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9284.56s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[02:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9287.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[02:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9293.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9303.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9309.56s)]
*  Now, Pierre-Paul Liev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[02:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9319.56s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9330.56s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[02:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9336.56s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9341.56s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[02:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9352.56s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along, [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9354.56s)]
*  that the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9358.56s)]
*  to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[02:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9361.56s)]
*  No. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[02:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9367.56s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[02:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9375.56s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[02:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9382.56s)]
*  And we should. [[02:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9397.56s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9402.56s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9407.56s)]
*  I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians, [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9413.56s)]
*  care about building a strong economy. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9419.56s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9422.56s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9428.56s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[02:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9431.56s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9437.56s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9442.56s)]
*  that she'd given to her nine and ten-year-old students. [[02:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9449.56s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9452.56s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9457.56s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9460.56s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good. [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9464.56s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, [[02:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9467.56s)]
*  or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9471.56s)]
*  These kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9480.56s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9488.56s)]
*  what we all want for each other. [[02:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9492.56s)]
*  But you know what struck me is that many of these cards, [[02:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9494.56s)]
*  the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[02:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9500.56s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9506.56s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9510.56s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9514.56s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[02:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9519.56s)]
*  And then the child goes on and says, [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9532.56s)]
*  a Canada that is not the United States. [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9536.56s)]
*  That is what that states. [[02:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9542.56s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9545.56s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9552.56s)]
*  So, well, I know these times are unsettling. [[02:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9555.56s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9559.56s)]
*  And not because, not because it's easy, [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9567.56s)]
*  not because it'll be easy, but because it is right. [[02:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9571.56s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9574.56s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[02:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9583.56s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9593.56s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9597.56s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9614.56s)]
*  I know that's dangerous to say. [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9620.56s)]
*  Good luck. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9623.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[02:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9625.56s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9627.56s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9630.56s)]
*  I need your help because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9638.56s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9644.56s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, [[02:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9647.56s)]
*  a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9650.56s)]
*  to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9654.56s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left [[02:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9659.56s)]
*  in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9666.56s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9672.56s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9676.56s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[02:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9681.56s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9683.56s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C., could decide the next Prime Minister. [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9686.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9692.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9697.56s)]
*  to build a united Canada that works for all. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9701.56s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9704.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9708.56s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9709.56s)]
*  All right. [[02:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9739.56s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9746.56s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you, Diana. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9750.56s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9754.56s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, [[02:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9759.56s)]
*  trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, [[02:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9765.56s)]
*  commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[02:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9769.56s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9773.56s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. [[02:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9778.56s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9782.56s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing liberal candidates [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9790.56s)]
*  that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[02:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9796.56s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9806.56s)]
*  Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9812.56s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election? [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9825.56s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9834.56s)]
*  Okay. With this room, I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9848.56s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. And their most steadfast ally. [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9854.56s)]
*  Boom indeed. Exactly. Keep going. [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9860.56s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9863.56s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9870.56s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9876.56s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9880.56s)]
*  This, yeah. [[02:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9891.56s)]
*  This, this is time for serious leadership. Serious leadership and a united country. [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9900.56s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together. But we need to act. [[02:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9911.56s)]
*  We need to act. We need to come together. And I saw a sign that said this. [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9915.56s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9918.56s)]
*  There it is. En français. Même en français. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9928.56s)]
*  Se battre, protéger, bâtir. C'est ça. [[02:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9935.56s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[02:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9937.56s)]
*  Minimum in France. [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9945.56s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9948.56s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses. [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9950.56s)]
*  Using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. [[02:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9957.56s)]
*  Here, I probably have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9962.56s)]
*  And above all, above all, in BC and across Canada, we unite. [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9969.56s)]
*  In BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9989.56s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=9997.56s)]
*  Some big changes. And I'm ready to make them. [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10008.56s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[02:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10012.56s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10018.56s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10026.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10032.56s)]
*  Homes, boy, I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. Homes have become too expensive. [[02:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10037.56s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10043.56s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10050.56s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10058.56s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. So we got rid of it. [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10073.56s)]
*  We got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[02:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10079.56s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[02:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10081.56s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. The BC government followed up. [[02:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10092.56s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10100.56s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[02:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10108.56s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10112.56s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[02:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10118.56s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians have benefited. [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10123.56s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10135.56s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10142.56s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10154.56s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[02:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10158.56s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. And we're going to make them. [[02:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10165.56s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[02:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10174.56s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10188.56s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[02:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10196.56s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10209.56s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10218.56s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10224.56s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10235.56s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10249.56s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[02:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10266.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10273.56s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10280.56s)]
*  That's what we need. [[02:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10290.56s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10294.56s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. Once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10304.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10324.56s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[02:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10335.56s)]
*  Turn America to the border. [[02:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10342.56s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10344.56s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10352.56s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. [[02:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10358.56s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10366.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10368.56s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[02:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10372.56s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10381.56s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10387.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10404.56s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10408.56s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. [[02:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10414.56s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was what my... [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10420.56s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10430.56s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10433.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10443.56s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[02:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10445.56s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10452.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10455.56s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[02:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10464.56s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[02:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10469.56s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10473.56s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10476.56s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10478.56s)]
*  Right? [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10489.56s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10491.56s)]
*  But these are... [[02:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10494.56s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10497.56s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[02:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10504.56s)]
*  I relied on these values when I went to Canada and abroad for crises. [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10507.56s)]
*  And today... [[02:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10514.56s)]
*  And today I rely on them to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10518.56s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10543.56s)]
*  Because... [[02:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10548.56s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10550.56s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[02:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10552.56s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[02:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10557.56s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world. [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10560.56s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[02:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10564.56s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10576.56s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10579.56s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind, but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10582.56s)]
*  And I say... I say so. [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10595.56s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[02:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10598.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10605.56s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. [[02:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10606.56s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[02:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10611.56s)]
*  We need... [[02:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10615.56s)]
*  Because... because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10619.56s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[02:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10628.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the U.S. with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[02:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10632.56s)]
*  We resist. We will win. [[02:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10640.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10644.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10646.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10648.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10650.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10652.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10654.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10656.56s)]
*  We will win. [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10658.56s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. [[02:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10660.56s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[02:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10664.56s)]
*  They will get weaker. [[02:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10666.56s)]
*  We will get stronger. [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10668.56s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10670.56s)]
*  You know what? [[02:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10677.56s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada and look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[02:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10679.56s)]
*  They want our resources. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10686.56s)]
*  They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[02:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10689.56s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. Never for many reasons. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10696.359999999999s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. Canada is not America. [[02:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10706.56s)]
*  America. America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. [[02:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10714.56s)]
*  We're all Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10725.56s)]
*  In the United States, health care is a big business. In Canada, health care is a right. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10731.56s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize the indigenous peoples. [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10746.56s)]
*  And there will never be rights for the French language. [[02:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10760.56s)]
*  The United States is not Canada and Canada will never be part of America. [[02:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10765.56s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10771.56s)]
*  So, having solved that, so what do we do? So what do we do now? Fight. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10777.56s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[02:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10793.56s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10805.56s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10810.56s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[03:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10816.56s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10823.56s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10834.56s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[03:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10840.56s)]
*  No, that's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10859.56s)]
*  956 days and counting. It took me three weeks. Had to fill out a couple forms. Tell the truth. It wasn't that hard. [[03:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10873.56s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up to me. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10885.56s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. We can control our economic destiny. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10890.56s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10906.56s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[03:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10913.56s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10929.56s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10937.56s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10944.56s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10950.56s)]
*  And government needs to step up. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10955.56s)]
*  Government needs to step up and provide direction, to catalyze action, and drive investment. [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10980.56s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=10991.56s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11003.56s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. We've got to start by making, making the government spend less, so that Canadians can invest more. [[03:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11007.56s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11018.56s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11027.56s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super power, to create a career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11044.56s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11065.56s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11080.56s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11089.56s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11098.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke, it's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[03:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11107.56s)]
*  Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Paulièvre has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11116.56s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. It's very subtle, that. That's the big issue of our day. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11127.56s)]
*  I know the world's superpowers attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[03:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11139.56s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11149.56s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. He wants to cut what Canadians value, childcare, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11163.56s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[03:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11181.56s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working Canadians. [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11201.56s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. Unlike Pierre Paulièvre, I've managed budgets before. I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[03:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11211.56s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11225.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11233.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11249.56s)]
*  Now, Pierre Paulièvre and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[03:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11259.56s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[03:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11275.56s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[03:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11289.56s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11298.56s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11307.56s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[03:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11316.56s)]
*  I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11330.56s)]
*  And we should. [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11338.56s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[03:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11343.56s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians, care about building a strong economy. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11348.56s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[03:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11363.56s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[03:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11369.56s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11376.56s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[03:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11382.56s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11392.56s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. Others, yeah, be good, yeah. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11400.56s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11408.56s)]
*  These kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11417.56s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11425.56s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereigns. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11430.56s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11442.56s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[03:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11452.56s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11457.56s)]
*  And then the child goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[03:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11467.56s)]
*  That is what that states. [[03:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11481.56s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11486.56s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11496.56s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[03:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11508.56s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11515.56s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11520.56s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11534.56s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[03:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11539.56s)]
*  I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[03:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11556.56s)]
*  I'm sorry, I know that's dangerous to say. [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11561.56s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. [[03:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11565.56s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11568.56s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11571.56s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11581.56s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[03:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11585.56s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11587.56s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup final. [[03:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11600.56s)]
*  You know what to do. [[03:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11610.56s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11614.56s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[03:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11617.56s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11619.56s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[03:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11622.56s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[03:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11624.56s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[03:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11627.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11633.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11638.56s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[03:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11645.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11648.56s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[03:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11650.56s)]
*  All right. [[03:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11668.56s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11687.56s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11689.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11692.56s)]
*  Thank you, Diana. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11693.56s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11695.56s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11700.56s)]
*  Commitment and compassion, as in everything that she does. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11710.56s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11714.56s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[03:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11717.56s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11719.56s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11721.56s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11723.56s)]
*  And it's great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11731.56s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11754.56s)]
*  Who's ready? [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11760.56s)]
*  Who is ready? [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11762.56s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11764.56s)]
*  Who is ready? [[03:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11775.56s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11777.56s)]
*  Okay. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11789.56s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11791.56s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11793.56s)]
*  But we need it. [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11795.56s)]
*  Elbows up. [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11797.56s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11798.56s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[03:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11801.56s)]
*  Keep going. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11803.56s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11804.56s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11810.56s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11812.56s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11815.56s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11818.56s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11822.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11833.56s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11835.56s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11847.56s)]
*  We need to come together. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11852.56s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[03:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11854.56s)]
*  We need to come together. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11856.56s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11857.56s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11859.56s)]
*  There it is. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11869.56s)]
*  En français. Même en français. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11871.56s)]
*  Se battre pour te débattir, c'est ça. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11875.56s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11878.56s)]
*  Minimum. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11886.56s)]
*  They asked for it. [[03:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11889.56s)]
*  They're getting it. [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11890.56s)]
*  We need to protect. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11891.56s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[03:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11893.56s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11901.56s)]
*  Pierre Polly have pocketed all the money. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11906.56s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11908.56s)]
*  And above all, above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11912.56s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11936.56s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11938.56s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes, some big changes, and I'm ready to make them. [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11946.56s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[03:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11952.56s)]
*  You can probably tell I am not a career politician, but I am a pragmatist. [[03:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11956.56s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11961.56s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11967.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11972.56s)]
*  Homes, boy, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey. [[03:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11979.56s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[03:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11982.56s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them, and we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[03:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11984.56s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using B.C. technology, B.C. skilled trays, and B.C. lumber. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=11991.56s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12007.56s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12014.56s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12017.56s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12019.56s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12022.56s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12033.56s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12037.56s)]
*  Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12041.56s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12047.56s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12053.56s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12059.56s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians have benefited. [[03:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12064.56s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[03:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12075.56s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12082.56s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the U.S. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12095.56s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[03:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12099.56s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12106.56s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12109.56s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12115.56s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12129.56s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[03:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12137.56s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12150.56s)]
*  Anything. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12158.56s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[03:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12159.56s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its best. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12165.56s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. [[03:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12176.56s)]
*  Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[03:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12182.56s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Poliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12187.56s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12203.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12213.56s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12220.56s)]
*  That's what we need. [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12231.56s)]
*  Because we need, in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12235.56s)]
*  Because, as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. [[03:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12244.56s)]
*  Once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12252.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[03:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12266.56s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12272.56s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12281.56s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12284.56s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12292.56s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. That's our responsibility. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12298.56s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12315.56s)]
*  Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12321.56s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12329.56s)]
*  We will win. [[03:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12346.56s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12349.56s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12356.56s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was... [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12362.56s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12371.56s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[03:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12386.56s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard, the importance of supporting our community, the importance of caring for other people. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12400.56s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12415.56s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12430.56s)]
*  But these are... these are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. And I took them with me. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12434.56s)]
*  I took them with me. [[03:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12445.56s)]
*  And I'm using these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[03:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12460.56s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. Cut. Cut. I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12490.56s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[03:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12500.56s)]
*  Much easier that way. And it's a kind of... it's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12517.56s)]
*  Let me say... let me say something. Yeah. Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. Yeah. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12535.56s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. And we need action, not anger. Action. Yeah, we need... sorry. [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12547.56s)]
*  Because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. Negativity won't lower the price of the stock. [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12559.56s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[03:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12579.56s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. It's not going to pay the rent. It's not going to win a trade war. It will not make Canada strong. [[03:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12583.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the U.S. with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[03:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12592.56s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. They will get weaker. We will get stronger. We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12600.56s)]
*  You know what? When the Americans look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. They want our resources. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12610.56s)]
*  They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. Never for many reasons. [[03:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12629.56s)]
*  But most fundamentally, because Canada is not America. Canada is not America. America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12645.56s)]
*  In the United States, health care is a big business. In Canada, health care is a right. [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12675.56s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize indigenous peoples. And there will never be rights for the French language. [[03:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12687.56s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. And Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[03:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12706.56s)]
*  So, having solved that, what do we do? What do we do now? Fight. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12720.56s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12733.56s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12745.56s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. We need a leader who can stand up to him. I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[03:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12755.56s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. No. It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[03:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12768.56s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12798.56s)]
*  956 days in counting. It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. I had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[03:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12812.56s)]
*  So we are, we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. We can control our destiny, our economy. We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[03:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12829.56s)]
*  Because, because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[03:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12853.56s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[03:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12869.56s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs. [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12884.56s)]
*  Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party [[03:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12904.56s)]
*  That is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12934.56s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? We've got to start at home. We've got to start by making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[03:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12943.56s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[03:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12960.56s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12967.56s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super powerhouse, to create a career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[03:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=12978.56s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13005.56s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13021.56s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13028.56s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[03:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13038.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[03:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13046.56s)]
*  Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[03:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13056.56s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws, as Canada. That's very clever. That's very subtle, that. That's the big issue of our day. [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13067.56s)]
*  I know the world's superpowers attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[03:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13080.56s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13089.56s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13097.56s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13104.56s)]
*  He wants to cut, he wants to cut what Canadians value. Child care, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13109.56s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13121.56s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hardworking Canadians. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13138.56s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13152.56s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. And I've managed crises before. [[03:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13161.56s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13168.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[03:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13173.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[03:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13180.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13188.56s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13195.56s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13205.56s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[03:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13217.56s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[03:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13222.56s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[03:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13233.56s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[03:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13235.56s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[03:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13239.56s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13243.56s)]
*  No. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what will make Canada strong. [[03:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13246.56s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13256.56s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. And we should. [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13263.56s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13283.56s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13287.56s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[03:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13301.56s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[03:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13307.56s)]
*  And I want to give an example. From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[03:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13313.56s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13326.56s)]
*  And some kids were asked to write a book about their dreams for Canada. [[03:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13334.56s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[03:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13338.56s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[03:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13346.56s)]
*  These kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13358.56s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13367.56s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13372.56s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13383.56s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13391.56s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13401.56s)]
*  And then the child goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[03:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13413.56s)]
*  That is what that states. [[03:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13423.56s)]
*  Okay, you know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[03:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13425.56s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[03:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13437.56s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13446.56s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[03:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13456.56s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13464.56s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[03:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13473.56s)]
*  Wow. Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know that's dangerous to say. [[03:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13483.56s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[03:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13494.56s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13500.56s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13510.56s)]
*  And I know a number of you, and I know that you're going to be there. [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13517.56s)]
*  I need your help. Because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13521.56s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13529.56s)]
*  a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13538.56s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[03:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13541.56s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. That means knocking on more doors. [[03:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13553.56s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. It means talking to your friends and families. And it means to vote Liberal. [[03:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13561.56s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[03:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13567.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[03:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13574.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13579.56s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13586.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. [[03:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13590.56s)]
*  All right. [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13597.56s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. Thank you. Thank you, Diana. [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13627.56s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13636.56s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13641.56s)]
*  trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13647.56s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. [[03:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13654.56s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. [[03:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13660.56s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13664.56s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[03:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13671.56s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[03:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13683.56s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[03:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13688.56s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13699.56s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[03:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13710.56s)]
*  Okay. With this room, I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13730.56s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. [[03:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13735.56s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13738.56s)]
*  Boo indeed. Exactly. Keep going. [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13741.56s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13744.56s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[03:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13752.56s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[03:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13758.56s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13760.56s)]
*  This, yep. This, this is time for serious leadership. [[03:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13771.56s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13786.56s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. [[03:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13792.56s)]
*  We need to come together, and I saw a sign that said this. [[03:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13797.56s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13800.56s)]
*  There it is. En français. Même en français. [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13809.56s)]
*  Se battre, protéger, bâtir. C'est ça. [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13816.56s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[03:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13819.56s)]
*  Minimum. They asked for it. They're getting it. [[03:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13827.56s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[03:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13832.56s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13842.56s)]
*  Pierre Apolli have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13847.56s)]
*  And above all, above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada's future. [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13853.56s)]
*  And if we don't, it's wrong. That's what we're going to do. [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13876.56s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes. [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13884.56s)]
*  Some big changes, and I'm ready to make them. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13890.56s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[03:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13894.56s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[03:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13899.56s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13908.56s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[03:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13913.56s)]
*  Homes, oh I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13919.56s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. So we are cutting taxes on them. [[03:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13922.56s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[03:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13927.56s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[03:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13932.56s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[03:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13939.56s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13955.56s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13960.56s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[03:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13962.56s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13973.56s)]
*  The BC government followed up. Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[03:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13977.56s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13987.56s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[03:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=13999.56s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[03:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14003.56s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[03:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14016.56s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[03:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14019.56s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[03:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14036.56s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[03:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14044.56s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[03:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14048.56s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[03:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14051.56s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[03:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14056.56s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[03:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14066.56s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14078.56s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[03:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14084.56s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[03:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14099.56s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[03:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14106.56s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[03:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14112.56s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14125.56s)]
*  And that's if he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[03:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14143.56s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[03:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14154.56s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14162.56s)]
*  That's what we need. Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14173.56s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[03:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14186.56s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14203.56s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[03:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14214.56s)]
*  Turn him back to the border. But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[03:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14223.56s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. [[03:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14234.56s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14247.56s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[03:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14253.56s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[03:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14270.56s)]
*  We will win. [[03:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14282.56s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[03:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14289.56s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[03:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14297.56s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14302.56s)]
*  And what they stressed was, I'm talking about my parents. [[03:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14305.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14316.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14325.56s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. They stress the importance. [[03:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14327.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14337.56s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. The importance of supporting our community. [[03:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14338.56s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14354.56s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, [[03:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14359.56s)]
*  and this being Canada, stay humble. [[03:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14368.56s)]
*  I don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[03:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14371.56s)]
*  But these are, these are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14376.56s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[03:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14385.56s)]
*  I relied on these values when I went to Canada and abroad for crises. [[03:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14388.56s)]
*  And today, and today I rely on these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[03:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14394.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14414.56s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[04:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14416.56s)]
*  Because, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. I know, I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14429.56s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[04:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14438.56s)]
*  I have though seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14441.56s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14458.56s)]
*  And it's a kind of, it's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14459.56s)]
*  And I say, I say so. Yeah. [[04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14476.56s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[04:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14479.56s)]
*  We need, we need calm, not chaos. And we need action, not anger. Action. [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14485.56s)]
*  We need, that's right. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14496.56s)]
*  That's right. [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14497.56s)]
*  Because, because, because negativity will not allow us to win a commercial war. [[04:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14499.56s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[04:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14509.56s)]
*  Negativity will not make the price of the stock price drop. [[04:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14514.56s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[04:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14519.56s)]
*  It will not make Canada full. [[04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14523.56s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. It's not going to pay the rent. [[04:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14525.56s)]
*  It's not going to win a trade war. It will not make Canada strong. [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14529.56s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[04:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14533.56s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. [[04:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14541.56s)]
*  They will get weaker. We will get stronger. We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14546.56s)]
*  That's right. [[04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14553.56s)]
*  You know what? When the Americans look, look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[04:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14558.56s)]
*  They want our resources. They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[04:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14568.56s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[04:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14578.56s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14583.56s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. Canada is not America. [[04:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14586.56s)]
*  America. [[04:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14595.56s)]
*  America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. [[04:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14600.56s)]
*  We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[04:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14608.56s)]
*  You know, in the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14614.56s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[04:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14623.56s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize the indigenous peoples. [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14627.56s)]
*  And we will never forget the French language. [[04:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14635.56s)]
*  The United States is not Canada and Canada will never ever be part of America. [[04:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14640.56s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America. [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14646.56s)]
*  In any way, Canada is not America. [[04:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14649.56s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America. [[04:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14652.56s)]
*  In any way, shape or form. [[04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14656.56s)]
*  So, having solved that. [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14661.56s)]
*  So what do we do? So what do we do now? [[04:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14668.56s)]
*  Fight. [[04:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14673.56s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[04:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14674.56s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14678.56s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14686.56s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14691.56s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[04:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14697.56s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14701.56s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. [[04:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14704.56s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14708.56s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14715.56s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump. [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14721.56s)]
*  Who copies his ideas and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14727.56s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[04:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14739.56s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[04:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14752.56s)]
*  It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[04:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14756.56s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple of forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[04:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14761.56s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14765.56s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14769.56s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14783.56s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[04:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14787.56s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14793.56s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[04:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14801.56s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[04:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14811.56s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14818.56s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14825.56s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[04:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14831.56s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs. [[04:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14836.56s)]
*  Party, party, party, party, party, party, party, party. [[04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14847.56s)]
*  The government needs to step up, government needs to step up, and provide direction. [[04:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14857.56s)]
*  To catalyze action, and drive investment. [[04:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14866.56s)]
*  And that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[04:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14871.56s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? [[04:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14885.439999999999s)]
*  How do we do that? [[04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14887.9s)]
*  We've got to start at home. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14890.96s)]
*  We've got to start by making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[04:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14892.4s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[04:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14900.24s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[04:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14908.92s)]
*  Build, baby, build. [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14915.28s)]
*  That is what we're going to do. [[04:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14917.64s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super power, to create [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14926.32s)]
*  a career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14935.08s)]
*  around the world. [[04:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14945.32s)]
*  Our plan. [[04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14947.6s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[04:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14948.6s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a [[04:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14952.32s)]
*  new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14958.56s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[04:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14962.48s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[04:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14970.039999999999s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14973.039999999999s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14980.72s)]
*  yesterday. [[04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14987.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. [[04:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14988.199999999999s)]
*  I thought the same thing, actually. [[04:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14991.599999999999s)]
*  Same thing. [[04:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14993.08s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14994.08s)]
*  Lots of pictures. [[04:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14998.279999999999s)]
*  Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[04:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=14999.279999999999s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand [[04:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15002.16s)]
*  up to President Trump. [[04:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15007.039999999999s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws. [[04:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15009.8s)]
*  As Canada. [[04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15013.48s)]
*  That's very clever. [[04:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15014.48s)]
*  It's very subtle, that. [[04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15015.48s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[04:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15017.48s)]
*  I know the world's superpower is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first [[04:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15021.8s)]
*  and deal with the Americans. [[04:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15027.48s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15031.679999999998s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy [[04:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15038.52s)]
*  that works for everyone. [[04:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15043.68s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[04:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15045.36s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. [[04:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15051.6s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[04:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15057.16s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[04:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15067.84s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15074.2s)]
*  It's not a solution. [[04:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15082.8s)]
*  Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working families. [[04:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15085.04s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15092.2s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[04:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15098.08s)]
*  I've managed economy. [[04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15103.400000000001s)]
*  I've managed economies before. [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15104.720000000001s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15107.2s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15110.2s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[04:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15115.68s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[04:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15126.64s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[04:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15136.68s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15146.68s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[04:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15154.04s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15158.68s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend [[04:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15163.76s)]
*  for themselves. [[04:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15170.960000000001s)]
*  It's possible. [[04:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15172.68s)]
*  They could believe it. [[04:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15174.68s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[04:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15176.68s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[04:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15179.68s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[04:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15183.68s)]
*  No. [[04:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15189.68s)]
*  Anyone? [[04:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15190.68s)]
*  Any takers? [[04:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15191.68s)]
*  No. [[04:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15192.68s)]
*  That is not what will make Canada strong. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15193.68s)]
*  I know, we know. [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15197.68s)]
*  We can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15199.68s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know. [[04:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15211.68s)]
*  As America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[04:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15214.68s)]
*  And we should. [[04:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15219.68s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[04:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15221.68s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few [[04:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15229.68s)]
*  words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15236.68s)]
*  strong economy. [[04:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15243.68s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[04:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15244.68s)]
*  It's because we care about people. [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15247.68s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15251.68s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[04:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15254.68s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15262.68s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that [[04:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15265.68s)]
*  she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[04:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15271.68s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[04:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15275.68s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[04:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15279.68s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[04:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15282.68s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. [[04:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15288.68s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, [[04:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15291.68s)]
*  dignity, and respect. [[04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15297.68s)]
*  These kids, like the kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[04:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15299.68s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for [[04:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15304.68s)]
*  each other. [[04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15308.68s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[04:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15309.68s)]
*  Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[04:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15312.68s)]
*  And I think that's what they're expressing. [[04:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15318.68s)]
*  And I think that's what they're expressing. [[04:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15321.68s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[04:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15324.68s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[04:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15327.68s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15331.68s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[04:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15336.68s)]
*  Okay. [[04:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15341.68s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15343.68s)]
*  That is what that state. [[04:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15350.68s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream of a safe, a clean, and a [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15353.68s)]
*  clean Canada. [[04:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15360.68s)]
*  Okay. [[04:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15362.68s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15364.68s)]
*  That is what our children should be able to dream of. [[04:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15373.68s)]
*  And the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[04:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15377.68s)]
*  That is what the state should be able to do. [[04:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15383.68s)]
*  Okay. [[04:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15386.68s)]
*  And that's what I dream of. [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15388.68s)]
*  Okay. [[04:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15390.68s)]
*  And that's what I dream of. [[04:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15392.68s)]
*  That's what I dream of. [[04:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15394.68s)]
*  Okay. [[04:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15396.68s)]
*  I'm standing here before you. [[04:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15398.68s)]
*  You know, Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15401.08s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. [[04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15416.32s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15420.92s)]
*  Wow. [[04:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15426.48s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[04:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15427.48s)]
*  I know that's dangerous to say. [[04:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15443.48s)]
*  Good luck. [[04:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15447.199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[04:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15448.199999999999s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[04:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15450.199999999999s)]
*  But in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[04:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15454.88s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[04:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15462.88s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15466.88s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15469.88s)]
*  to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[04:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15475.88s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15481.88s)]
*  You know what to do. [[04:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15491.88s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[04:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15495.88s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[04:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15498.88s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15500.88s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[04:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15503.88s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15505.88s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. took this side, the next Prime Minister. [[04:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15508.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[04:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15514.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[04:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15519.88s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[04:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15526.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15530.88s)]

*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, [[04:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15581.88s)]
*  trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15587.88s)]

*  I'm going to speak. [[04:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15613.88s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15619.88s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[04:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15636.88s)]
*  Who's ready? [[04:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15641.88s)]
*  Who is ready? [[04:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15643.88s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15645.88s)]
*  Who is ready? [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15656.88s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[04:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15658.88s)]
*  Okay. [[04:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15670.88s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[04:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15672.88s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15674.88s)]
*  But we need it. [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15676.88s)]
*  Elbows up. [[04:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15678.88s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[04:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15679.88s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[04:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15682.88s)]
*  Keep going. [[04:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15684.88s)]
*  This is a tragedy. [[04:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15685.88s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[04:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15691.88s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15693.88s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[04:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15696.88s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[04:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15698.88s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[04:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15702.88s)]
*  This... [[04:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15713.88s)]
*  This... [[04:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15716.88s)]
*  This is time for serious leadership. [[04:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15721.88s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[04:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15727.88s)]
*  We need to come together. [[04:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15733.88s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[04:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15735.88s)]
*  We need to come together. [[04:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15737.88s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[04:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15738.88s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[04:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15740.88s)]
*  There it is. [[04:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15750.88s)]
*  In French. Even in French. [[04:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15752.88s)]
*  To protect and to build. That's it. [[04:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15756.88s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15759.88s)]
*  Minimum. [[04:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15767.88s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. [[04:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15770.88s)]
*  We need to protect. [[04:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15772.88s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15774.88s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[04:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15782.88s)]
*  Pierre Pauly have pocketed all the money. [[04:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15787.88s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15789.88s)]
*  And above all... [[04:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15793.88s)]
*  Arnie! Arnie! Arnie! [[04:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15795.88s)]
*  Above all... [[04:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15804.88s)]
*  Above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[04:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15808.88s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[04:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15817.88s)]
*  Now... [[04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15819.88s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. [[04:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15824.88s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15827.88s)]
*  Some big changes. And I'm ready to make them. [[04:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15830.88s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[04:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15833.88s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[04:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15840.88s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15843.88s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[04:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15848.88s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[04:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15853.88s)]
*  Homes... Oh, I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. [[04:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15859.88s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[04:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15863.88s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[04:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15865.88s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[04:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15867.88s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, [[04:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15872.88s)]
*  BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[04:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15876.88s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike... What was that doing? [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15880.88s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[04:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15895.88s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[04:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15898.88s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[04:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15900.88s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, [[04:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15903.88s)]
*  but it was too divisive. Too divisive. [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15912.88s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[04:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15915.88s)]
*  The BC government followed up. [[04:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15918.88s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[04:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15922.88s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[04:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15930.88s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[04:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15934.88s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[04:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15940.88s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[04:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15945.88s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[04:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15957.88s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[04:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15964.88s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[04:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15976.88s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[04:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15980.88s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[04:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15987.88s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[04:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15990.88s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[04:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=15996.88s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[04:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16010.88s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16018.88s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[04:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16031.88s)]
*  Anything. [[04:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16039.88s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[04:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16040.88s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[04:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16046.88s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16057.88s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16068.88s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[04:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16084.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[04:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16094.88s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[04:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16101.88s)]
*  That's what we need. [[04:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16112.88s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[04:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16116.88s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. Once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us. [[04:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16125.88s)]
*  He is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[04:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16138.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[04:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16147.88s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[04:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16157.88s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[04:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16163.88s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16165.88s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[04:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16173.88s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. [[04:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16179.88s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[04:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16187.88s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[04:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16193.88s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[04:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16202.88s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16209.88s)]
*  We will win. [[04:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16222.88s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[04:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16230.88s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[04:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16236.88s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[04:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16242.88s)]
*  And what they stressed was, I'm talking about my parents. [[04:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16244.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16256.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16259.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16261.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16263.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16265.88s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[04:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16267.88s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[04:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16273.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16276.88s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16286.88s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16290.88s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[04:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16294.88s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[04:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16296.88s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[04:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16299.88s)]
*  Right? [[04:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16311.88s)]
*  I don't teach you to stay humble in the US. [[04:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16312.88s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[04:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16313.88s)]
*  But these are, these are, these are Surrey values. [[04:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16315.88s)]
*  These, these are Canadian values. [[04:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16322.88s)]
*  And I took them with me, I took them with me. [[04:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16325.88s)]
*  I relied on these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[04:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16328.88s)]
*  And today, and today I rely on these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[04:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16335.88s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[04:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16354.88s)]
*  Because, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[04:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16369.88s)]
*  I know, I know, I don't get it either. [[04:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16374.88s)]
*  I don't get it. [[04:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16377.88s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[04:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16378.88s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[04:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16382.88s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16398.879999999997s)]
*  And it's a kind of, it's a kind of politician who never changes his mind, but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[04:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16400.88s)]
*  Say, say so. [[04:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16416.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16419.88s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[04:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16420.88s)]
*  We need, we need calm, not chaos. [[04:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16427.88s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[04:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16432.88s)]
*  Action. [[04:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16436.88s)]
*  We need to have that, sorry. [[04:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16437.88s)]
*  Because, because, because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16441.88s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[04:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16449.88s)]
*  Negativity won't make the price of the stock price drop. [[04:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16454.88s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[04:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16459.88s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent, it's not going to win a trade war, it will not make Canada strong. [[04:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16464.88s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16473.88s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. They will get weaker, we will get stronger, we will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[04:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16481.88s)]
*  You know what? [[04:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16498.88s)]
*  When the Americans look, look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[04:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16501.88s)]
*  They want our resources. [[04:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16508.88s)]
*  They want our water. [[04:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16511.88s)]
*  That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[04:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16513.88s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[04:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16518.88s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[04:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16524.88s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[04:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16527.88s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[04:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16533.88s)]
*  America. [[04:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16535.88s)]
*  America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. [[04:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16540.88s)]
*  The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16550.88s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[04:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16555.88s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[04:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16563.88s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize Indigenous peoples. [[04:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16574.88s)]
*  And there will never be rights for the French language. [[04:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16582.88s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[04:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16587.88s)]
*  So, having solved that, what do we do? [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16601.88s)]
*  Fight! [[04:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16612.88s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16614.88s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[04:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16618.88s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[04:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16626.88s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[04:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16631.88s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[04:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16638.88s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[04:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16641.88s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16644.88s)]
*  That leader is not Pierre Poliev. [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16656.88s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Poliev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, [[04:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16661.88s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[04:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16669.88s)]
*  That's not Pierre Poliev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada [[04:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16680.88s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[04:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16687.88s)]
*  956 days in counting. [[04:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16694.88s)]
*  It took me three weeks. I had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[04:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16698.88s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up to me. [[04:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16706.88s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[04:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16710.88s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[04:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16723.88s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[04:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16727.88s)]
*  Because in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[04:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16733.88s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16739.88s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[04:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16744.88s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[04:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16749.88s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[04:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16757.88s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[04:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16764.88s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[04:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16770.88s)]
*  And government needs... [[04:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16775.88s)]
*  Government needs... [[04:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16779.88s)]
*  Government needs... [[04:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16781.88s)]
*  Government needs... [[04:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16783.88s)]
*  Government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction. [[04:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16799.88s)]
*  To catalyze action. [[04:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16806.88s)]
*  And drive investment. [[04:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16810.88s)]
*  And that... [[04:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16813.88s)]
*  That is what our plan... [[04:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16816.88s)]
*  That is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[04:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16819.88s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[04:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16825.88s)]
*  We start... We got to start at home. [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16829.88s)]
*  We've got to start by making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16832.88s)]
*  We have to cut out. And we will cut out government waste. [[04:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16842.88s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[04:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16848.88s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[04:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16855.88s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes. [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16863.88s)]
*  To make Canada a super powerhouse. [[04:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16869.88s)]
*  To create a good career in specialized jobs. [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16873.88s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[04:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16878.88s)]
*  Our plan. There was a lot in that. [[04:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16886.88s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war. [[04:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16891.88s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[04:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16897.88s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[04:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16902.88s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[04:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16911.88s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[04:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16920.88s)]
*  Because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16923.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. [[04:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16929.88s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[04:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16934.88s)]
*  Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[04:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16937.88s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[04:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16941.88s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws. [[04:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16949.88s)]
*  As Canada. That's very clever. Very subtle that. [[04:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16952.88s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[04:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16957.88s)]
*  I know the world's super power is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[04:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16960.88s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[04:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16967.88s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[04:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16971.88s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy and an economy that works for everyone. [[04:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16977.88s)]
*  He's surrendering. Literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[04:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16984.88s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. [[04:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16990.88s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=16996.88s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[04:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17007.88s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[04:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17013.88s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way. $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[04:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17022.88s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[04:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17029.88s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17036.88s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17041.88s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[04:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17046.88s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[04:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17048.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[04:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17054.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sew division. [[04:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17061.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[04:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17069.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17077.88s)]
*  Now, Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[04:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17082.88s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[04:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17094.88s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[04:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17099.88s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[04:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17104.88s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[04:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17114.88s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[04:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17117.88s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, [[04:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17121.88s)]
*  to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[04:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17124.88s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[04:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17131.88s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17138.88s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[04:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17149.88s)]
*  And we should. [[04:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17160.88s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[04:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17165.88s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care [[04:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17171.88s)]
*  and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[04:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17179.88s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[04:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17186.88s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[04:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17192.88s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[04:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17203.88s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment [[04:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17206.88s)]
*  that she'd given to her nine and ten-year-old students. [[04:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17212.88s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[04:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17216.88s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[04:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17220.88s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[04:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17223.88s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water [[04:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17228.88s)]
*  or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[04:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17235.88s)]
*  These kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[04:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17243.88s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[04:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17252.88s)]
*  And you know what struck me is that many of these cards, [[04:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17258.88s)]
*  the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[04:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17264.88s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[04:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17270.88s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[04:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17274.88s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[04:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17278.88s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[04:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17283.88s)]
*  Okay? [[04:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17289.88s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[04:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17295.88s)]
*  That's what that states. [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17305.88s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, [[04:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17308.88s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[04:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17315.88s)]
*  So, well, I know these times are unsettling. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17318.88s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17322.88s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it'll be easy, but because it is right. [[04:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17329.88s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[04:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17337.88s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[04:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17341.88s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17356.88s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[04:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17360.88s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[04:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17377.88s)]
*  I'm sorry, I know that's dangerous to say. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17383.88s)]
*  Good luck. [[04:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17387.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17388.88s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[04:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17390.88s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, [[04:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17393.88s)]
*  I need your help because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[04:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17401.88s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[04:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17407.88s)]
*  And I know a number of you can see you. [[04:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17409.88s)]
*  A number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, [[04:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17412.88s)]
*  a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[04:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17418.88s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[04:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17422.88s)]
*  You know what to do. [[04:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17434.88s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17436.88s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[04:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17439.88s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[04:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17441.88s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17443.88s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17446.88s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C., could decide the next Prime Minister. [[04:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17448.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17454.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[04:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17460.88s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[04:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17467.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17470.88s)]
*  Let's see you go, Coach. [[04:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17472.88s)]
*  All right. [[04:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17500.88s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[04:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17505.88s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[04:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17510.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17512.88s)]
*  Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[04:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17514.88s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, [[04:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17522.88s)]
*  trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and compassion, as in everything that she does. [[04:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17527.88s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17535.88s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[04:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17538.88s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[04:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17540.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[04:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17543.88s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest-growing, most diverse community. [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17545.88s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[04:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17552.88s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[04:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17562.88s)]
*  Who's ready? [[04:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17567.88s)]
*  Who is ready? [[04:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17569.88s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17571.88s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[04:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17577.88s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[04:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17581.88s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[04:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17585.88s)]
*  Who is ready? [[04:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17597.88s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[04:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17599.88s)]
*  Okay. [[04:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17605.88s)]
*  Okay. [[04:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17611.88s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[04:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17612.88s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[04:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17614.88s)]
*  But we need it. [[04:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17616.88s)]
*  Elbows up. [[04:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17618.88s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[04:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17619.88s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[04:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17622.88s)]
*  Keep going. [[04:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17624.88s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[04:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17625.88s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[04:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17631.88s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17633.88s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[04:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17637.88s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[04:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17639.88s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[04:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17643.88s)]
*  This, yeah. [[04:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17654.88s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. [[04:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17657.88s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[04:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17668.88s)]
*  We need to come together. [[04:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17674.88s)]
*  We need to come together. [[04:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17675.88s)]
*  But we need to act. [[04:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17677.88s)]
*  We need to come together. [[04:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17678.88s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[04:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17679.88s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[04:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17681.88s)]
*  There it is. [[04:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17691.88s)]
*  En français, même en français. [[04:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17693.88s)]
*  Se battre, protéger, bâtir, c'est ça. [[04:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17697.88s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[04:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17700.88s)]
*  Minimum. [[04:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17708.88s)]
*  They asked for it. [[04:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17710.88s)]
*  They're getting it. [[04:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17711.88s)]
*  We need to protect. [[04:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17713.88s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[04:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17715.88s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[04:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17723.88s)]
*  Pierre Polly have pocketed all the money. [[04:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17728.88s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[04:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17730.88s)]
*  And above all, above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[04:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17734.88s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[04:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17757.88s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. [[04:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17760.88s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[04:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17768.88s)]
*  Some big changes. [[04:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17771.88s)]
*  And I'm ready to make them. [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17772.88s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17774.88s)]
*  You can probably tell. [[04:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17777.88s)]
*  I am not a career politician. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17778.88s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[04:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17780.88s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[04:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17783.88s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[04:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17788.88s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[04:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17794.88s)]
*  Homes, boy, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey. [[04:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17800.88s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[04:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17803.88s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[04:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17805.88s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[04:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17808.88s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using B.C. technology. [[04:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17812.88s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using B.C. skilled trays and B.C. lumber. [[04:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17817.88s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[04:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17829.88s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[04:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17836.88s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[04:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17839.88s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[04:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17841.88s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[04:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17842.88s)]
*  We saw. [[04:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17844.88s)]
*  You know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17846.88s)]
*  Too divisive. [[04:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17854.88s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[04:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17855.88s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17858.88s)]
*  Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a liter at the pump. [[04:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17863.88s)]
*  Okay. [[04:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17869.88s)]
*  So what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[04:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17871.88s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[04:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17875.88s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[04:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17883.88s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care regime so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[04:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17888.88s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[04:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17898.88s)]
*  So... [[04:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17902.88s)]
*  We have... [[04:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17905.88s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17907.88s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the U.S. [[04:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17918.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17922.88s)]
*  We are Canada. [[04:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17925.88s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[04:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17926.88s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[04:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17927.88s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. [[04:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17928.88s)]
*  We've got others. [[04:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17930.88s)]
*  And we're going to make friends. [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17931.88s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[04:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17937.88s)]
*  So at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[04:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17951.88s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17959.88s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[04:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17972.88s)]
*  Anything. [[04:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17980.88s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. [[04:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17981.88s)]
*  But that's what it takes. [[04:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17985.88s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. [[04:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17987.88s)]
*  And my government will do its bit. [[04:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17991.88s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. [[04:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=17998.88s)]
*  Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[05:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18004.88s)]
*  So in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[05:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18012.88s)]
*  Now, and that's if he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[05:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18028.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. [[05:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18036.88s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[05:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18041.88s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[05:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18043.88s)]
*  That's what we need. [[05:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18054.88s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[05:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18057.88s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, [[05:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18067.88s)]
*  President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18076.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[05:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18087.88s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[05:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18098.88s)]
*  Turn him back to the border. [[05:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18104.88s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[05:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18106.88s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[05:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18114.88s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves, and we have to take care of each other. [[05:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18120.88s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18128.88s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. [[05:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18134.88s)]
*  But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[05:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18141.88s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[05:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18150.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18164.88s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[05:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18171.88s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[05:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18177.88s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[05:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18183.88s)]
*  And what they stressed was... [[05:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18186.88s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[05:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18192.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18197.88s)]
*  You know, the lessons. They stressed the importance. [[05:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18208.88s)]
*  They stressed the importance. [[05:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18214.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18218.88s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[05:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18227.88s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[05:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18231.88s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[05:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18235.88s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[05:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18237.88s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[05:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18239.88s)]
*  Right? [[05:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18251.88s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the US. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[05:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18252.88s)]
*  But these are... [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18256.88s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[05:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18260.88s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[05:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18266.88s)]
*  I took them with me. [[05:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18268.88s)]
*  I supported these values when I managed crises in Canada and abroad. [[05:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18269.88s)]
*  And today... [[05:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18277.88s)]
*  And today I support these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[05:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18281.88s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[05:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18297.88s)]
*  Because... [[05:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18310.88s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. Cut. Cut. [[05:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18312.88s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[05:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18315.88s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[05:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18319.88s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[05:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18323.88s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[05:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18339.88s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[05:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18341.88s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[05:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18344.88s)]
*  And I say... I say so. Yeah. [[05:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18357.88s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[05:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18360.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18367.88s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. [[05:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18369.88s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18373.88s)]
*  Action. [[05:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18377.88s)]
*  Yeah, we need to... [[05:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18378.88s)]
*  That's right. [[05:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18380.88s)]
*  Because... because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[05:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18382.88s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[05:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18391.88s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[05:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18395.88s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. It's not going to pay the rent. It's not going to win a trade war. It will not make Canada strong. [[05:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18405.88s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the U.S. with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[05:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18414.88s)]
*  Resist! [[05:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18421.88s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. They will get weaker. We will get stronger. We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[05:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18422.88s)]
*  That's right. [[05:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18431.88s)]
*  That's right. [[05:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18434.88s)]
*  You know what? [[05:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18438.88s)]
*  When the Americans look... look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[05:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18441.88s)]
*  They want our resources. [[05:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18449.88s)]
*  They want our water. [[05:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18452.88s)]
*  That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[05:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18454.88s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[05:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18459.88s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[05:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18464.88s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[05:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18468.88s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[05:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18474.88s)]
*  America. [[05:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18476.88s)]
*  America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[05:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18481.88s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[05:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18496.88s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[05:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18504.88s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize Indigenous peoples. [[05:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18515.88s)]
*  And there will never be a right for French. [[05:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18523.88s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[05:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18528.88s)]
*  So, having solved that... [[05:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18542.88s)]
*  He doesn't like that. I know. So what do we do? So what do we do now? [[05:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18549.88s)]
*  Fight! [[05:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18553.88s)]
*  Fight! Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[05:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18554.88s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[05:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18559.88s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[05:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18567.88s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[05:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18572.88s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[05:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18579.88s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[05:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18585.88s)]
*  That leader... That leader is not... It's not Pierre Polyev. [[05:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18597.88s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, [[05:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18604.88s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[05:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18610.88s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada [[05:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18621.88s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[05:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18628.88s)]
*  956 days and counting. It took me three weeks. [[05:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18635.88s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth. It wasn't that hard. [[05:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18642.88s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up to me. [[05:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18647.88s)]
*  So we are in a situation where, as usual, we are at home. [[05:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18657.88s)]
*  We can control our destiny. [[05:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18664.88s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[05:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18668.88s)]
*  Because in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[05:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18675.88s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[05:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18682.88s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[05:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18687.88s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[05:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18692.88s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[05:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18699.88s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[05:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18706.88s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back and starts to retreat. [[05:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18712.88s)]
*  And government needs... [[05:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18717.88s)]
*  Government needs... [[05:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18721.88s)]
*  Government needs... [[05:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18724.88s)]
*  Government needs to step up and provide direction, to catalyze action and drive investment. [[05:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18740.88s)]
*  And that... [[05:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18753.88s)]
*  That is what our plan... [[05:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18756.88s)]
*  That is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[05:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18759.88s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[05:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18765.88s)]
*  We start... We got to start at home. [[05:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18769.88s)]
*  We've got to start by making... making the government spend less, so that Canadians can invest more. [[05:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18772.88s)]
*  We have to cut out. And we will cut out government waste. [[05:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18782.88s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[05:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18788.88s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[05:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18795.88s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes. [[05:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18800.88s)]
*  To make Canada a super-powerful energy. [[05:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18805.88s)]
*  To create a good career in specialized jobs. [[05:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18809.88s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[05:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18814.88s)]
*  Our plan. [[05:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18822.88s)]
*  There was a time when we were in a very difficult situation. [[05:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18824.88s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[05:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18829.88s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war. [[05:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18832.88s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[05:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18837.88s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[05:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18842.88s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[05:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18851.88s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[05:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18853.88s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[05:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18860.88s)]
*  Because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[05:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18863.88s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. [[05:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18869.88s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[05:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18875.88s)]
*  Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures to Pierre. [[05:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18878.88s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Paulièvre has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[05:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18882.88s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws. [[05:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18889.88s)]
*  As Canada. That's very clever. [[05:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18893.88s)]
*  It's very subtle that. [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18896.88s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[05:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18898.88s)]
*  I know the world's super-power is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[05:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18901.88s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[05:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18908.88s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[05:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18912.88s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[05:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18918.88s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[05:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18925.88s)]
*  He wants to cut, he wants to cut what Canadians value. [[05:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18931.88s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[05:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18937.88s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[05:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18948.88s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[05:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18954.88s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[05:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18964.88s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[05:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18973.88s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Paulièvre, I've managed budgets before. [[05:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18978.88s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[05:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18983.88s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[05:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18987.88s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[05:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18990.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[05:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=18996.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[05:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19007.88s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[05:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19014.88s)]
*  Now, Pierre Paulièvre and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[05:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19023.88s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[05:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19034.88s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[05:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19039.88s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[05:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19044.88s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[05:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19054.88s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[05:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19057.88s)]
*  But the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[05:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19061.88s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[05:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19071.88s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[05:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19078.88s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[05:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19090.88s)]
*  And we should. [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19101.88s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[05:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19106.88s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians, care about building a strong economy. [[05:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19112.88s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[05:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19126.88s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[05:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19132.88s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[05:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19143.88s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[05:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19146.88s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[05:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19156.88s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[05:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19163.88s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[05:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19169.88s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[05:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19184.88s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[05:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19192.88s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards, the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[05:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19198.88s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[05:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19210.88s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[05:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19218.88s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[05:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19223.88s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[05:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19235.88s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[05:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19248.88s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[05:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19258.88s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[05:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19269.88s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[05:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19277.88s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[05:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19286.88s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[05:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19295.88s)]
*  Wow. Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an oiler's sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know that's dangerous to say. [[05:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19305.88s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes. Soon, soon. [[05:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19314.88s)]
*  Look, I'm going to say that Canada is a safe country. [[05:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19321.88s)]
*  Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes. Soon, soon. [[05:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19327.88s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[05:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19333.88s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[05:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19343.88s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, [[05:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19350.88s)]
*  a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[05:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19359.88s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[05:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19363.88s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[05:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19373.88s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. [[05:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19379.88s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. And it means to vote Liberal. [[05:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19384.88s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C., could decide the next Prime Minister. [[05:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19389.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[05:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19395.88s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[05:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19401.88s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[05:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19408.88s)]
*  All right. Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. Thank you. Thank you, Diana. [[05:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19431.88s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[05:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19457.88s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, [[05:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19462.88s)]
*  trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[05:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19468.88s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. Thank you for everything you're doing. [[05:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19477.88s)]
*  Thanks for having me. It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[05:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19484.88s)]
*  And it's great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[05:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19493.88s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[05:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19514.88s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[05:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19532.88s)]
*  Okay. With this room, I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[05:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19552.88s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. And their most steadfast ally. [[05:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19557.88s)]
*  Boo indeed. Exactly. Keep going. [[05:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19562.88s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[05:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19566.88s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[05:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19573.88s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[05:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19579.88s)]
*  This, yeah. This, this, this is time for serious leadership, serious leadership and a united country. [[05:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19594.88s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together. But we need to act. We need to come together. [[05:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19614.88s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[05:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19619.88s)]
*  There it is. En français. Même en français. Se battre, protéger, bâtir. C'est ça. [[05:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19632.88s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[05:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19641.88s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[05:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19651.88s)]
*  Every single dollar. Pierre Pauli have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[05:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19664.88s)]
*  And above all, above all, in B.C. and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[05:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19675.88s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. [[05:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19698.88s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes, some big changes, and I'm ready to make them. [[05:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19708.88s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[05:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19714.88s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[05:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19721.88s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[05:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19729.88s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[05:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19735.88s)]
*  Homes, I don't need to tell you this here, I'm sorry. Homes have become too expensive. [[05:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19741.88s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them and we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[05:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19746.88s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using B.C. technology, B.C. skilled trays, and B.C. lumber. [[05:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19753.88s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? [[05:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19769.88s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. [[05:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19776.88s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19781.88s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[05:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19784.88s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[05:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19795.88s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. [[05:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19799.88s)]
*  Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[05:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19803.88s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[05:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19811.88s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[05:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19815.88s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[05:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19823.88s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care system so that 5 million Canadians can benefit from it. [[05:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19828.88s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[05:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19837.88s)]
*  Let's go. [[05:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19842.88s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[05:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19845.88s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the U.S. [[05:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19857.88s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[05:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19865.88s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends, we've got others. [[05:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19869.88s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[05:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19877.88s)]
*  I'm unique. [[05:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19887.88s)]
*  So at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[05:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19892.88s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[05:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19900.88s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[05:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19907.88s)]
*  Anything. Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[05:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19920.88s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[05:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19928.88s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st, free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[05:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19938.88s)]
*  So in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[05:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19954.88s)]
*  Now, and that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[05:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19968.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[05:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19976.88s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[05:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19983.88s)]
*  That's what we need. [[05:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19994.88s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[05:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=19997.88s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[05:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20007.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[05:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20028.88s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[05:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20038.88s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[05:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20045.88s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[05:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20047.88s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[05:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20054.88s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. [[05:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20060.88s)]
*  That's our response. [[05:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20068.88s)]
*  That's our response. [[05:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20069.88s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[05:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20075.88s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[05:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20084.88s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[05:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20090.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20107.88s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[05:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20111.88s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. [[05:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20117.88s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was... [[05:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20123.88s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[05:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20131.88s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[05:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20136.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20138.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20146.88s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[05:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20148.88s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[05:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20155.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20157.88s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[05:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20167.88s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[05:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20172.88s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[05:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20176.88s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[05:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20179.88s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[05:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20181.88s)]
*  I don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[05:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20192.88s)]
*  But these are... [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20197.88s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[05:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20200.88s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[05:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20207.88s)]
*  I relied on these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[05:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20210.88s)]
*  And today... [[05:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20217.88s)]
*  And today I rely on these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[05:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20220.88s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[05:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20246.88s)]
*  Because... [[05:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20251.88s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[05:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20253.88s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[05:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20256.88s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[05:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20260.88s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world. [[05:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20263.88s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[05:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20267.88s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[05:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20279.88s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[05:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20282.88s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind, but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[05:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20285.88s)]
*  And I say... I say so. [[05:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20298.88s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[05:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20301.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20308.88s)]
*  We need... we need calm, not chaos. [[05:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20309.88s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[05:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20314.88s)]
*  We need... [[05:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20318.88s)]
*  That's right. [[05:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20320.88s)]
*  Because... because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[05:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20322.88s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[05:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20332.88s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[05:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20335.88s)]
*  We resist. We will win. [[05:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20342.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20346.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20348.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20350.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20352.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20354.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20356.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20358.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20360.88s)]
*  We will win. [[05:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20362.88s)]
*  We resist. [[05:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20363.88s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[05:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20365.88s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[05:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20367.88s)]
*  They will get weaker. [[05:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20369.88s)]
*  We will get stronger. [[05:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20371.88s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[05:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20373.88s)]
*  You know what? [[05:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20375.88s)]
*  When the Americans look... look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[05:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20381.88s)]
*  They want our resources. [[05:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20390.88s)]
*  They want our water. [[05:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20392.88s)]
*  That's right. They want our land. [[05:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20395.88s)]
*  They want our country. [[05:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20397.88s)]
*  They want our country. [[05:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20399.88s)]
*  Never. Never. Never. Never. [[05:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20401.88s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[05:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20404.88s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[05:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20408.88s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[05:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20414.88s)]
*  America. [[05:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20417.88s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[05:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20422.88s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[05:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20425.88s)]
*  Look at the diversity. We're all Canadians. [[05:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20427.88s)]
*  Look at this room. [[05:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20429.88s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[05:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20431.88s)]
*  The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[05:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20433.88s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[05:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20437.88s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[05:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20445.88s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20451.88s)]
*  We don't recognize indigenous peoples. [[05:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20457.88s)]
*  And there will never be rights for the French language. [[05:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20461.88s)]
*  The United States are not Canada and Canada will never be part of America. [[05:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20467.88s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[05:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20474.88s)]
*  So, having solved that, what do we do? [[05:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20479.88s)]
*  So what do we do now? [[05:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20493.88s)]
*  Fight. [[05:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20495.88s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[05:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20497.88s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[05:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20500.88s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[05:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20506.88s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[05:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20512.88s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[05:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20518.88s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[05:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20522.88s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. [[05:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20525.88s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[05:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20529.88s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[05:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20530.88s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Pauliev. [[05:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20537.88s)]
*  No. It's not Pierre Pauliev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, [[05:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20543.88s)]
*  who copies his ideas and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[05:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20550.88s)]
*  That's not Pierre Pauliev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada [[05:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20561.88s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[05:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20569.88s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[05:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20575.88s)]
*  It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[05:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20579.88s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[05:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20583.88s)]
*  It wasn't that hard. I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[05:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20586.88s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[05:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20598.88s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[05:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20605.88s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[05:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20609.88s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[05:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20616.88s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetimes, [[05:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20623.88s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[05:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20628.88s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[05:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20633.88s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[05:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20640.88s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[05:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20647.88s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[05:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20653.88s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs. [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20658.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20670.88s)]
*  The, government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction, [[05:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20678.88s)]
*  to catalyze action and drive investment. [[05:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20687.88s)]
*  investment. And that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20692.88s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? We start, we got to start at home. [[05:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20706.4s)]
*  We've got to start by making the government spend less so that Canadians [[05:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20713.960000000003s)]
*  can invest more. We have to cut out and we will cut out government waste. But the [[05:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20720.28s)]
*  core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. Build baby [[05:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20731.199999999997s)]
*  build. That is what we're going to do. [[05:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20738.48s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20742.36s)]
*  super power, to create a good career in specialized jobs, to build new [[05:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20754.24s)]
*  commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. Our plan. There was a lot [[05:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20762.440000000002s)]
*  in that. Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war and it will [[05:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20772.04s)]
*  usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. We will create $20,000 in new [[05:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20779.76s)]
*  growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. That's what we mean. [[05:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20787.88s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. Now I'm going to do a little [[05:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20795.32s)]
*  comparison because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[05:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20803.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. It's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. Same thing. It didn't take me [[05:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20811.6s)]
*  long to read it, actually. Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures of Pierre. And really what it [[05:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20817.64s)]
*  demonstrated that once again Pierre-Paul Liev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[05:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20824.879999999997s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. Very subtle, that. That's [[05:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20830.68s)]
*  the big issue of our day. I know the world's super power is attacking us, but [[05:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20840.96s)]
*  like let's sort out the straw thing first and deal with the Americans. He's offering Canadians a [[05:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20847.52s)]
*  fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the [[05:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20856.04s)]
*  strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. He's surrendering, literally surrendering [[05:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20864.44s)]
*  in the fight against climate change. He wants to cut what Canadians value. Childcare, dental care, [[05:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20870.36s)]
*  pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. He has a bring-it-home [[05:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20880.96s)]
*  tax cut that is never home. It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave [[05:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20892.2s)]
*  office. It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[05:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20903.920000000002s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. Unlike Pierre-Paul Liev, [[05:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20910.68s)]
*  I've managed budgets before. I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. And I've managed [[05:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20921.2s)]
*  crises before. And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. A crisis is a [[05:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20929.96s)]
*  time for bold action, not tired ideology. A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[05:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20943.44s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. Now, Pierre-Paul Liev and Mr. Trump's allies here [[05:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20953.359999999997s)]
*  in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, they don't like our plan to stand up to President [[05:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20973.399999999998s)]
*  Trump. And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. Maybe they believe [[05:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20979.399999999998s)]
*  that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. It's possible. [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20986.519999999997s)]
*  They could believe it. Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. That the way [[05:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=20996.92s)]
*  to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and [[05:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21002.92s)]
*  hope for the best. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what will make Canada strong. I know, we know, [[05:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21007.8s)]
*  we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21021.88s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. And we should. [[05:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21031.480000000003s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. Now, I talk a lot about a [[05:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21043.08s)]
*  strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as [[05:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21056.280000000002s)]
*  Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. And it goes back to community. [[05:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21062.440000000002s)]
*  It's because we care about people. That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in [[05:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21070.36s)]
*  this together. And I want to give an example. From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who [[05:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21078.68s)]
*  told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten-year-old students. [[05:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21091.8s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd [[05:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21096.84s)]
*  written. And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others [[05:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21103.16s)]
*  dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, [[05:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21112.92s)]
*  and respect. These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[05:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21119.88s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[05:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21126.280000000002s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs. And I think [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21131.08s)]
*  that's the most important thing. And I'm going to quote one of them. [[05:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21141.56s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21145.64s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[05:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21154.36s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[05:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21161.56s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[05:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21176.920000000002s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, [[05:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21184.2s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. So, well, I know these times are unsettling. I also know [[05:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21197.32s)]
*  that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[05:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21205.0s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it'll be easy, but because it is right. [[05:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21208.92s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[05:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21219.879999999997s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[05:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21227.719999999998s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[05:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21238.280000000002s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know [[05:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21259.480000000003s)]
*  it's dangerous to say. If you're like, I, yeah, it's not. Okay, yes, soon, soon. Look, but [[05:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21266.52s)]
*  in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your [[05:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21278.2s)]
*  help because there are only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. [[05:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21284.280000000002s)]
*  And I know a number of you can see you. A number of you have already given so much of your time [[05:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21291.8s)]
*  and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[05:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21297.64s)]
*  But to use, to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game [[05:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21304.52s)]
*  seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[05:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21312.28s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. It means talking to [[05:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21321.32s)]
*  your friends and families. And it means to vote Liberal. Because the people of Surrey, the people [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21326.84s)]
*  of DC, could decide the next Prime Minister. I'm asking for your vote to protect the values [[05:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21333.8s)]
*  that we share. I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that [[05:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21341.079999999998s)]
*  works for all. Let's build Canada strong. [[05:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21348.2s)]
*  All right. [[05:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21378.2s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. Thank you. Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction, [[05:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21392.280000000002s)]
*  but for all of your work on this campaign. Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, [[05:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21402.28s)]
*  making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and [[05:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21409.32s)]
*  compassion as in everything that she does. Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this [[05:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21416.68s)]
*  all week. Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. It is great to be in Canada [[05:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21423.399999999998s)]
*  fastest growing, most diverse community. And it's great. [[05:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21433.16s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to [[05:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21441.4s)]
*  build Canada strong. So look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand [[05:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21452.52s)]
*  up for Canada with me? Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most [[05:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21472.52s)]
*  consequential election of our lifetimes? Okay. With this room, I think we got a shot. We got a [[05:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21486.359999999997s)]
*  shot at winning that election, but we need it. Elbows up. And their most steadfast ally. [[05:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21498.2s)]
*  Boo indeed. Exactly. Keep going. This, you know, it's actually, it is, [[05:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21506.04s)]
*  this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy, but it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. [[05:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21513.0s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. We will get through this crisis if we come together, [[05:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21522.44s)]
*  if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. This, yeah. [[05:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21531.72s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership, serious leadership [[05:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21538.6s)]
*  and a united country. We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. [[05:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21554.199999999997s)]
*  We need to come together. And I saw a sign that said this. We need to come together to fight, [[05:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21561.48s)]
*  to protect and to build Canada. There it is. [[05:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21566.68s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum [[05:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21583.56s)]
*  damage in the United States. Minimum. They asked for it. They're getting it. [[05:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21589.4s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of [[05:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21596.760000000002s)]
*  those tariffs. Every single dollar. Pierre Pauli have pocketed all the money. We're going to send [[06:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21605.32s)]
*  it to our workers. And above all, above all in BC and across Canada, we thank you for your patience [[06:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21614.2s)]

*  Good evening. Is this on? Can you guys hear me? [[06:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21678.440000000002s)]
*  Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, [[06:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21685.48s)]
*  hey. [[06:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21694.84s)]
*  It's one of those ones you have to turn on. [[06:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21712.68s)]
*  Um, it's my pleasure to be here. [[06:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21714.28s)]
*  Um, I'm just gonna do a couple of songs here. [[06:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21719.28s)]
*  Um, I've never been shy of an opinion in my music, [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21723.28s)]
*  so when people tell me to shut up and sing, it's the same thing. [[06:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21727.28s)]
*  But, uh, really glad to be supporting, uh, Mark Carney [[06:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21732.28s)]
*  and, uh, making sure that he is the next, forms the next government. [[06:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21736.28s)]
*  And every road feels... [[06:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21741.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21744.28s)]
*  I wrote that song, uh, in December of 2016, [[06:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21747.28s)]
*  right after a very televised election in the United States. [[06:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21750.28s)]
*  And, uh, I realized that it, it's a very, uh, [[06:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21754.28s)]
*  very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, [[06:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21760.28s)]
*  very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, [[06:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21763.28s)]
*  very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, very, uh, [[06:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21766.28s)]
*  I realized that it, the fear that I feel about the world, [[06:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21769.28s)]
*  it is the same fear that people feel who agree, you know, [[06:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21774.28s)]
*  believe something totally different than I feel. [[06:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21778.28s)]
*  And that, in a way, that fear connects us all. [[06:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21781.28s)]
*  And if we can get over that fear, [[06:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21786.28s)]
*  we could probably see the human in everybody [[06:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21788.28s)]
*  and probably find some common ground with just about anybody. [[06:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21791.28s)]
*  And I, I believe that, you know, [[06:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21794.28s)]
*  we can do a lot with an invitational energy, um, [[06:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21797.28s)]
*  to invite people in and to get them excited about community [[06:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21800.28s)]
*  and togetherness and unity and progressing as a country [[06:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21804.28s)]
*  and as a people and sovereignty and culture [[06:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21808.28s)]
*  and the CBC and all of these things. [[06:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21810.28s)]
*  Um... [[06:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21813.28s)]
*  Um, so I'm very excited to be here. [[06:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21816.28s)]
*  Um, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna leave with another, [[06:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21820.28s)]
*  uh, real bummer of a song here, um, [[06:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21823.28s)]
*  just to make sure we get real ramped up. [[06:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21827.28s)]
*  Um, this song, I feel like, was decades in the making for me. [[06:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21830.28s)]
*  It's a new song. [[06:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21834.28s)]
*  It's coming out on a record later this month, [[06:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21836.28s)]
*  and actually in May. [[06:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21838.28s)]
*  But, um, I figured I would call this song exactly what it was. [[06:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21840.28s)]
*  So this song is just called Soapbox. [[06:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21843.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21847.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21850.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21853.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21856.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21859.28s)]
*  Soapbox. [[06:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21862.28s)]
*  Damn the guessers. [[06:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21865.28s)]
*  Damn the liars. [[06:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21868.28s)]
*  Damn all the pretenders. [[06:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21871.28s)]
*  Damn all the reasons why. [[06:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21875.28s)]
*  Why they peddle the impending. [[06:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21880.28s)]
*  Why they can't be given light. [[06:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21884.28s)]
*  The hall of mirrors keeps on reflecting. [[06:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21888.28s)]
*  And the illusion multiplies. [[06:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21893.28s)]
*  Meanwhile they focus on division. [[06:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21897.28s)]
*  The meanest trick the devil pulled. [[06:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21900.28s)]
*  The sheep believe the road to freedom [[06:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21904.28s)]
*  was provided by the wolf. [[06:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21909.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21914.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21918.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21922.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21926.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21930.28s)]
*  So the pendulum keeps swinging. [[06:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21933.28s)]
*  But the arc takes a while. [[06:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21937.28s)]
*  Just long enough for some forgetting. [[06:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21941.28s)]
*  To bring the bad stuff back in style. [[06:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21945.28s)]
*  And they always talk of Jesus. [[06:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21950.28s)]
*  Without a hint of irony. [[06:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21954.28s)]
*  But they see kindness as a weakness. [[06:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21957.28s)]
*  And they disregard the meek. [[06:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21962.28s)]
*  So buy your groceries at the box store. [[06:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21966.28s)]
*  Keep your head down in the line. [[06:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21971.28s)]
*  They want you hungry so you'll want more. [[06:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21975.28s)]
*  They want you lonely so you're quiet. [[06:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21979.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21982.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21986.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21990.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21994.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=21998.28s)]
*  So go on and batten down the hatches. [[06:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22002.28s)]
*  Turn to whoever it is that you turn. [[06:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22006.28s)]
*  The lunatics have found the matches. [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22009.28s)]
*  And they want to see it burn. [[06:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22014.28s)]
*  See I've been yelling about forgiveness. [[06:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22018.28s)]
*  The altar and the other cheek. [[06:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22022.28s)]
*  But I fear now there is a sickness. [[06:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22026.28s)]
*  Something rotten in the seeds. [[06:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22030.28s)]
*  So can society have a chance to change. [[06:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22034.28s)]
*  So can society have cancer. [[06:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22037.28s)]
*  If so who will lead this dance. [[06:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22041.28s)]
*  If we could have just one good answer. [[06:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22045.28s)]
*  Maybe then we'd have a chance. [[06:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22050.28s)]
*  Maybe then we'd have a chance. [[06:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22054.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22059.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22063.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22067.28s)]
*  Mmm. [[06:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22071.28s)]
*  So I'm still waking up in Denver. [[06:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22075.28s)]
*  Still waking up in Inverness. [[06:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22079.28s)]
*  I am reminded to remember. [[06:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22083.28s)]
*  There is still beauty in the mess. [[06:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22087.28s)]
*  There are those who take in the smoke. [[06:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22091.28s)]
*  There are those who take in the strangers. [[06:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22094.28s)]
*  I suppose the kindness sets them free. [[06:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22098.28s)]
*  There are those who leave a light on. [[06:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22102.28s)]
*  In case another needs to see. [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22107.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. My name is Dan Mangan. [[06:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22118.28s)]
*  I'll be back up here in a little bit to say a few words. [[06:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22121.28s)]
*  Thank you. See you soon. [[06:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=22125.28s)]

*  My name is Kyle Latchford and I am proud to be your liberal candidate for Cloverdale Langley [[06:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23376.46s)]
*  City. [[06:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23381.58s)]
*  Right. [[06:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23382.820000000003s)]
*  I'm husband to Amanda and father to three wonderful daughters, Audrey, Peyton and Thea. [[06:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23385.820000000003s)]
*  Oh there they are. [[06:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23392.74s)]
*  We're joined today by our incredible BC team, Suk and Randeeb who have proudly represented [[06:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23396.420000000002s)]
*  Surrey and our community for so many years and will continue to do so. [[06:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23402.18s)]
*  And John, Ernie, Jill and Gerbax who have put their names forward to represent their [[06:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23410.14s)]
*  communities too. [[06:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23413.7s)]
*  We're also joined by our friends north of the Fraser. [[06:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23415.3s)]
*  The team standing here before you will bring a strong unified voice of British Columbia [[06:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23420.62s)]
*  in Ottawa. [[06:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23425.4s)]
*  I've spent my years in careers serving our community, but this is the most critical election [[06:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23427.5s)]
*  of our lifetime. [[06:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23433.38s)]
*  We need a leader who will stand up to Donald Trump, not mimic him and compare rally sizes. [[06:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23435.28s)]
*  That's right! [[06:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23443.039999999997s)]
*  We need a leader to unite Canadians, protect our communities, fight threats to our sovereignty [[06:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23449.6s)]
*  and build our country up. [[06:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23455.86s)]
*  The leader for the job is Mark Carney and he has the resume to prove it. [[06:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23462.2s)]
*  Who did Stephen Harper call on to manage the 2008 financial crisis? [[06:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23467.22s)]
*  Mark Carney. [[06:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23471.7s)]
*  And who was there to manage Brexit in the UK? [[06:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23474.420000000002s)]
*  Mark Carney. [[06:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23477.7s)]
*  The fact is when conservatives need help to manage the economy, they call on a liberal. [[06:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23479.98s)]
*  So in this last stretch of the campaign, let's go knock on doors, make calls and get out [[06:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23491.12s)]
*  the vote to elect a Mark Carney Liberal Government. [[06:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23496.719999999998s)]
*  I'm honoured to introduce someone who knows the Prime Minister best. [[06:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23508.84s)]
*  And please join me in giving a big, warm south of the Fraser welcome to Diana Fox Carney. [[06:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23512.719999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23519.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23547.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23550.379999999997s)]
*  Good evening. [[06:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23551.379999999997s)]
*  Bonsoir tout le monde. [[06:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23552.379999999997s)]
*  I'm so happy to be here. [[06:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23553.379999999997s)]
*  I'm so happy to see the sunshine here and to be here in beautiful British Columbia. [[06:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23555.18s)]
*  And as Kyle said, and thank you for the introduction, Kyle, I'm here to tell you a little bit more [[06:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23562.86s)]
*  about someone that I know pretty well and you guys are getting to know a bit better. [[06:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23568.18s)]
*  I want to start by acknowledging that we're in extremely difficult times. [[06:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23575.52s)]
*  We face a constantly shifting environment. [[06:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23582.52s)]
*  But amidst all this, one thing that remains constant is my husband, your Prime Minister. [[06:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23586.559999999998s)]
*  Mark is, he's unjaunted by the kinds of challenges that would fell most of us. [[06:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23594.56s)]
*  And that comes, what comes to mind for me most strongly is the morning after the Brexit [[06:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23610.260000000002s)]
*  referendum in the UK. [[06:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23615.18s)]
*  And it was Mark who stood up and led the way. [[06:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23617.940000000002s)]
*  He'd done his homework. [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23621.22s)]
*  When others were in disarray, Mark was prepared. [[06:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23623.74s)]
*  He had a plan. [[06:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23628.02s)]
*  He was ready then and he's ready now. [[06:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23629.780000000002s)]
*  But I also want to assure you that lest you think he's invincible, he also struggles with [[06:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23641.22s)]
*  things like managing the air fryer, keeping the inbox under control, all those kinds of [[06:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23646.38s)]
*  things that we all struggle with. [[06:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23652.02s)]
*  The big things, he's great. [[06:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23653.5s)]
*  And Mark is also very loyal. [[06:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23657.5s)]
*  He still has his friends from grade school. [[06:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23659.86s)]
*  He still has many of his spiral notebooks from grade school in the attic. [[06:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23663.34s)]
*  He talks about his family dog when he was growing up. [[06:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23668.219999999998s)]
*  And I think those of you who saw the oil escape video will know that he still holds on to [[06:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23671.899999999998s)]
*  his 1980s goalie skates from college. [[06:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23677.62s)]
*  But another thing that I always remark upon is Mark's strong focus on outcomes. [[06:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23682.019999999997s)]
*  And right now he's focused on creating the conditions under which everyone in Canada [[06:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23691.78s)]
*  can thrive. [[06:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23699.1s)]
*  He identifies the end point and then figures out how to get there, how to deliver. [[06:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23701.579999999998s)]
*  And he's dedicated to doing the very best job he can in every situation for everyone. [[06:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23708.3s)]
*  He has strongly held values. [[06:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23714.94s)]
*  He's a committed listener and he's amazingly good at seeing the wood from the trees. [[06:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23717.1s)]
*  And along the way, Mark builds and inspires confidence. [[06:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23724.219999999998s)]
*  In fact, one of the strange things about being married to Mark is that wherever we go, wherever [[06:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23729.66s)]
*  we find ourselves in the world, regardless of whether we speak the language or not, people [[06:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23734.22s)]
*  approach Mark on the street and they ask him for directions. [[06:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23738.7s)]
*  Little do they know that I am actually the one who has a sense of direction. [[06:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23744.7s)]
*  So I've been married to Mark for more than 30 years. [[06:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23751.579999999998s)]
*  And he still surprises me every day with his clarity of thought, his capacity for hard [[06:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23762.059999999998s)]
*  work, his incredible memory and his sparkling smile. [[06:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23769.019999999997s)]
*  I'm so proud of him and as a Canadian, I'm so thankful that the man I love has such a [[06:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23774.94s)]
*  deep commitment to public service. [[06:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23782.78s)]
*  I'm lucky to have him, we're lucky to have him, and without further ado, it's my pleasure [[06:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23785.739999999998s)]
*  to introduce my friend, your Liberal Leader and the Prime Minister who will make Canada [[06:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=23790.62s)]

*  we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[06:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24126.54s)]

*  Some big changes. [[06:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24153.420000000002s)]

*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[06:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24157.420000000002s)]

*  And that's [[06:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24174.3s)]
*  exactly what I did [[06:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24176.3s)]
*  as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[06:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24178.3s)]
*  Homes, [[06:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24180.3s)]
*  oh, I don't need to tell you this here, sorry. [[06:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24182.3s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[06:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24184.3s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[06:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24186.3s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy [[06:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24188.3s)]
*  to build twice as many homes. [[06:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24190.3s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year [[06:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24192.3s)]
*  using B.C. technology, [[06:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24194.3s)]
*  B.C. skilled trays, [[06:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24196.3s)]
*  and B.C. lumber. [[06:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24198.3s)]
*  And we're going to build a lot of homes. [[06:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24200.3s)]
*  We saw [[06:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24203.18s)]
*  that [[06:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24205.18s)]
*  the capital gains tax hike, [[06:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24207.18s)]
*  what was that doing? [[06:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24209.18s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[06:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24211.18s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[06:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24213.18s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[06:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24215.18s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[06:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24217.18s)]
*  We saw, [[06:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24219.18s)]
*  you know, across this country, [[06:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24221.18s)]
*  the consumer carbon tax hike, [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24223.18s)]
*  the carbon tax hike, [[06:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24225.18s)]
*  the carbon tax hike, [[06:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24227.18s)]
*  the carbon tax hike, [[06:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24229.18s)]
*  the consumer carbon tax, [[06:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24231.18s)]
*  look good on paper, [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24233.18s)]
*  but it was too divisive. [[06:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24235.18s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it [[06:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24237.18s)]
*  on day one. [[06:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24239.18s)]
*  The B.C. government followed up. [[06:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24241.18s)]
*  Premier Eby and the B.C. government followed up, [[06:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24245.18s)]
*  saving you at least 18 cents a liter at the pump. [[06:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24247.18s)]
*  And what we're going to do [[06:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24253.18s)]
*  doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change [[06:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24255.18s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters [[06:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24257.18s)]
*  to pay you to save energy [[06:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24259.18s)]
*  through home retrofit. [[06:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24261.18s)]
*  And I'm going to take some of these. [[06:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24263.18s)]
*  Not your tax dollars. [[06:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24265.18s)]
*  Them. [[06:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24267.18s)]
*  We have expanded [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24269.18s)]
*  access to the [[06:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24271.18s)]
*  Canadian dental care system [[06:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24273.18s)]

*  access to dental care. [[06:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24281.18s)]
*  We have [[06:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24283.18s)]
*  We have [[06:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24285.18s)]
*  We have [[06:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24287.18s)]

*  with the European Union [[06:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24291.18s)]
*  so that our exporters [[06:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24293.18s)]
*  are less dependent [[06:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24295.18s)]
*  on the United States. [[06:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24297.18s)]

*  less dependent on the U.S. [[06:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24301.18s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. [[06:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24307.18s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[06:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24309.18s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. [[06:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24311.18s)]
*  We've got others. [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24313.18s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement [[06:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24319.18s)]
*  with Australia [[06:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24321.18s)]
*  and strengthened our [[06:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24323.18s)]
*  military cooperation [[06:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24325.18s)]
*  with France and the United Kingdom. [[06:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24327.18s)]
*  So, at the end of my [[06:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24333.18s)]
*  first week as Prime Minister, [[06:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24335.18s)]
*  I brought together [[06:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24337.18s)]
*  all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[06:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24339.18s)]

*  all the barriers on trade [[06:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24343.18s)]

*  inside our own country. [[06:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24347.18s)]
*  And I went home that night [[06:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24353.18s)]
*  and I thought [[06:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24355.18s)]
*  when is the last time [[06:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24357.18s)]
*  all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[06:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24359.18s)]
*  Anything. [[06:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24361.18s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, [[06:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24363.18s)]
*  hatred of Ottawa. [[06:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24365.18s)]
*  Which is fair. [[06:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24367.18s)]
*  But the fact is [[06:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24369.18s)]
*  we need one Canadian economy, [[06:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24371.18s)]
*  not 13. [[06:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24373.18s)]
*  And my government will do its best. [[06:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24375.18s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, [[06:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24381.18s)]
*  we will eliminate all federal regulations [[06:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24383.18s)]
*  by July 1st. [[06:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24385.18s)]
*  Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[06:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24387.18s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, [[06:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24389.18s)]
*  before the election, [[06:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24391.18s)]
*  nine days of government, [[06:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24393.18s)]
*  we did more than Pierre Poliev [[06:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24395.18s)]
*  has imagined in all [[06:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24397.18s)]
*  of his decades in politics. [[06:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24399.18s)]
*  And that's it. [[06:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24405.18s)]
*  If he had an imagination [[06:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24407.18s)]

*  And the question is, [[06:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24423.18s)]
*  imagine what we could do together [[06:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24425.18s)]
*  over the next four years [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24427.18s)]

*  we need a strong and strong [[06:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24443.18s)]
*  and positive government. [[06:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24445.18s)]
*  Because [[06:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24447.18s)]
*  as he made clear [[06:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24449.18s)]

*  once again today in the Oval Office, [[06:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24453.18s)]
*  President Trump, [[06:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24455.18s)]
*  he is trying to break us [[06:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24457.18s)]
*  so that America [[06:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24459.18s)]
*  can own us. [[06:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24461.18s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. [[06:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24469.18s)]
*  That's the answer, Donald. [[06:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24471.18s)]
*  Yet that will never happen. [[06:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24473.18s)]
*  Ever. [[06:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24475.18s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. [[06:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24481.18s)]
*  They're not going to make it. [[06:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24483.18s)]
*  They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[06:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24485.18s)]

*  But you know what? [[06:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24489.18s)]
*  I've realized over the last few weeks [[06:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24491.18s)]
*  across the country, we're over [[06:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24493.18s)]
*  the shock of this betrayal. [[06:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24495.18s)]
*  But at the same time, [[06:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24497.18s)]
*  we should never forget the lessons [[06:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24499.18s)]
*  we've been taught. [[06:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24501.18s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. [[06:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24503.18s)]
*  And we have [[06:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24505.18s)]
*  to take care [[06:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24507.18s)]
*  of each other. [[06:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24509.18s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[06:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24511.18s)]
*  We didn't [[06:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24519.18s)]
*  ask for this fight. [[06:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24521.18s)]
*  But Canada is [[06:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24523.18s)]
*  strong. I'll tell you [[06:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24525.18s)]
*  Canadians [[06:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24527.18s)]
*  Canadians are always ready when someone [[06:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24529.18s)]
*  else drops the gloves. [[06:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24531.18s)]
*  And what the Americans [[06:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24533.18s)]

*  in this trade war, just [[06:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24539.18s)]
*  like in hockey, we [[06:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24541.18s)]

*  and on the ice. [[06:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24565.18s)]

*  The importance of caring [[06:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24617.18s)]

*  So what do we do now? [[06:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24935.18s)]
*  Fight. Now, [[06:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24937.18s)]
*  First, we have to manage through this crisis. [[06:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24939.18s)]
*  And my experience [[06:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24941.18s)]
*  is in a crisis, [[06:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24943.18s)]
*  you have to prepare for the worst, [[06:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24945.18s)]
*  not hope for the best. [[06:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24947.18s)]
*  You have to distinguish [[06:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24949.18s)]
*  between what you can change [[06:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24951.18s)]
*  and what you can't. [[06:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24953.18s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, [[06:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24955.18s)]
*  we can't change [[06:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24957.18s)]
*  President Trump. [[06:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24959.18s)]
*  So we need a leader who can [[06:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24961.18s)]
*  stand up to him. [[06:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24963.18s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[06:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24965.18s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[06:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24967.18s)]

*  Thank you. [[06:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24977.18s)]
*  That leader, [[06:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24979.18s)]
*  that leader is not, [[06:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24981.18s)]
*  it's not Pierre Polyev. [[06:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24983.18s)]
*  No. [[06:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24985.18s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his [[06:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24987.18s)]
*  inspiration from President Trump, [[06:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24989.18s)]
*  who copies his ideas, [[06:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24991.18s)]
*  and whose first instinct when [[06:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24993.18s)]
*  our nation was attacked [[06:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24995.18s)]
*  was to call Canada [[06:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24997.18s)]
*  stupid. [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=24999.18s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev [[06:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25003.18s)]
*  who chooses to be willfully blind [[06:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25005.18s)]
*  to the growing threats [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25007.18s)]
*  facing Canada by refusing [[06:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25009.18s)]
*  for some reason [[06:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25011.18s)]
*  to get his security [[06:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25013.18s)]
*  clearance. [[06:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25015.18s)]
*  956 days [[06:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25017.18s)]
*  in counting. [[06:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25019.18s)]
*  It took me, [[06:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25021.18s)]
*  it took me three weeks. [[06:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25023.18s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth. [[06:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25025.18s)]
*  Wasn't that hard? [[06:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25027.18s)]
*  I don't know. [[06:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25029.18s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[06:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25031.18s)]
*  I know. [[06:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25035.18s)]
*  So, we are [[06:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25039.18s)]
*  in a situation [[06:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25041.18s)]
*  as usual, [[06:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25043.18s)]
*  we are at home. [[06:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25045.18s)]
*  We can control our [[06:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25047.18s)]
*  economic destiny. [[06:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25049.18s)]
*  We can and we will [[06:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25051.18s)]
*  control our destiny [[06:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25053.18s)]
*  with the right plan. [[06:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25055.18s)]
*  Because [[06:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25057.18s)]
*  in a crisis, [[06:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25059.18s)]
*  in a crisis, plan beats [[06:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25061.18s)]
*  no plan. [[06:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25063.18s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we [[06:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25065.18s)]
*  are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25067.18s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, [[06:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25069.18s)]
*  you have to act with overwhelming [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25071.18s)]
*  force. [[06:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25073.18s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome [[06:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25075.18s)]
*  the anxieties that people naturally [[06:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25077.18s)]
*  feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[06:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25079.18s)]
*  We have to [[06:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25081.18s)]
*  act with overwhelming force to break [[06:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25083.18s)]
*  through the uncertainty [[06:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25085.18s)]
*  that businesses face. [[06:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25087.18s)]
*  And overwhelming force to [[06:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25089.18s)]
*  replace what the crisis [[06:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25091.18s)]
*  is taking away. [[06:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25093.18s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations [[06:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25095.18s)]
*  pulls back. It starts to retreat. [[06:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25097.18s)]
*  And government [[06:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25099.18s)]
*  and government needs [[06:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25101.18s)]
*  government needs [[06:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25103.18s)]
*  government needs [[06:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25105.18s)]
*  government needs [[06:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25107.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25111.18s)]
*  The government needs to step up and provide direction to catalyze action and drive investment. [[06:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25113.18s)]
*  That is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[06:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25139.46s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? [[06:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25148.46s)]
*  How do we do that? [[06:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25150.899999999998s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. [[06:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25152.14s)]
*  We've got to start by making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[06:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25155.379999999997s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[06:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25165.42s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[06:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25171.94s)]
*  Build baby build. [[06:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25178.579999999998s)]
*  That is what we're going to do. [[06:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25180.66s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super power, to create [[06:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25189.3s)]
*  a good career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable [[06:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25198.059999999998s)]
*  partners around the world. [[07:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25207.059999999998s)]
*  Our plan. [[07:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25210.62s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[07:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25211.62s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a [[07:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25215.34s)]
*  new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[07:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25221.58s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[07:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25225.5s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[07:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25233.06s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada Strong together. [[07:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25236.06s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform [[07:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25243.74s)]
*  yesterday. [[07:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25250.22s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke. [[07:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25251.22s)]
*  I thought the same thing, actually. [[07:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25254.22s)]
*  Same thing. [[07:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25256.22s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[07:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25257.22s)]
*  Lots of pictures. [[07:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25261.3s)]
*  Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[07:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25262.3s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Paulièvres has no plan to stand [[07:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25265.18s)]
*  up to President Trump. [[07:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25270.06s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws. [[07:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25272.8s)]
*  As Canada. [[07:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25276.48s)]
*  That was very clever. [[07:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25277.48s)]
*  It's very subtle, that. [[07:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25278.48s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[07:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25280.48s)]
*  I know the world's superpower is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[07:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25284.8s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[07:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25290.52s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[07:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25294.719999999998s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy [[07:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25301.52s)]
*  that works for everyone. [[07:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25306.72s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[07:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25308.4s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value. [[07:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25314.64s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[07:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25320.2s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[07:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25330.88s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[07:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25337.24s)]
*  It's not a solution. [[07:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25345.88s)]
*  Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working Canadians. [[07:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25348.08s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[07:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25355.16s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[07:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25361.12s)]
*  I've managed economy. [[07:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25366.44s)]
*  I've managed economies before. [[07:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25367.76s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[07:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25370.24s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[07:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25373.22s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25379.16s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[07:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25389.64s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[07:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25399.76s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[07:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25409.76s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[07:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25417.12s)]
*  And to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[07:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25422.079999999998s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend [[07:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25426.84s)]
*  for themselves. [[07:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25434.079999999998s)]
*  It's possible. [[07:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25435.079999999998s)]
*  They could believe it. [[07:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25438.4s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[07:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25439.760000000002s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[07:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25443.56s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[07:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25446.960000000003s)]
*  Anyone? [[07:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25450.960000000003s)]
*  Any takers? [[07:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25451.960000000003s)]
*  No. [[07:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25452.960000000003s)]
*  That is not what makes Canada strong. [[07:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25453.960000000003s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[07:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25461.160000000003s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[07:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25468.760000000002s)]
*  And we should. [[07:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25483.760000000002s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[07:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25488.760000000002s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few [[07:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25495.44s)]
*  words about why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a [[07:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25499.92s)]
*  strong economy. [[07:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25506.76s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[07:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25509.239999999998s)]
*  It's because we care about people. [[07:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25511.519999999997s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[07:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25515.16s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[07:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25518.239999999998s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[07:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25525.239999999998s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that [[07:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25528.239999999998s)]
*  she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[07:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25535.28s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[07:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25539.239999999998s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[07:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25543.359999999997s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[07:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25546.48s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good. [[07:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25550.28s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, [[07:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25554.8s)]
*  dignity and respect. [[07:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25561.32s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[07:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25566.32s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for [[07:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25575.32s)]
*  each other. [[07:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25579.48s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[07:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25580.68s)]
*  Is that many of these cards, the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[07:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25582.68s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[07:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25592.68s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[07:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25596.68s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[07:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25600.88s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[07:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25605.88s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[07:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25617.88s)]
*  That is what that states. [[07:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25627.88s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, [[07:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25630.88s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[07:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25637.88s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. [[07:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25641.88s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[07:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25644.88s)]
*  And not, not because, not because it's easy, not because it'll be easy, but because it [[07:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25652.88s)]
*  is right. [[07:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25658.88s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[07:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25660.88s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[07:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25668.88s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[07:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25678.88s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[07:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25683.88s)]
*  Wow. [[07:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25690.88s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[07:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25699.88s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[07:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25705.88s)]
*  I know that's, I know it's dangerous to say. [[07:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25706.88s)]
*  Good luck. [[07:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25708.88s)]
*  I, yeah, it's not. [[07:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25709.88s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[07:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25712.88s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness for, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, [[07:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25716.08s)]
*  I need your help. [[07:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25724.08s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[07:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25726.08s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[07:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25730.08s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much [[07:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25732.08s)]
*  of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight [[07:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25738.08s)]
*  for our country's future. [[07:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25743.08s)]
*  But to use, to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period [[07:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25745.280000000002s)]
*  of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[07:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25752.280000000002s)]
*  You know what to do. [[07:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25757.280000000002s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[07:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25759.280000000002s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[07:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25762.280000000002s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[07:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25764.280000000002s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[07:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25766.280000000002s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[07:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25769.280000000002s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[07:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25772.48s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[07:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25777.48s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works [[07:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25783.48s)]
*  for all. [[07:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25789.48s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[07:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25790.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25793.48s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[07:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25795.48s)]
*  All right. [[07:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25802.48s)]
*  Hello Surrey. [[07:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25803.48s)]

*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[07:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25840.08s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find [[07:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25845.08s)]
*  something nice to say about me as introductions. [[07:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25851.88s)]
*  Commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[07:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25856.08s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[07:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25859.08s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[07:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25861.08s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[07:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25864.08s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[07:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25866.48s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[07:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25868.68s)]
*  And it's great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in [[07:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25876.68s)]
*  Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[07:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25890.98s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[07:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25897.48s)]
*  Who's ready? [[07:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25905.68s)]
*  Who is ready? [[07:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25906.68s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[07:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25907.68s)]
*  Who is ready? [[07:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25914.68s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[07:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25922.68s)]
*  Okay. [[07:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25930.88s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[07:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25935.88s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[07:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25937.58s)]
*  But we need it. [[07:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25940.08s)]
*  Elbows up. [[07:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25941.48s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[07:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25942.48s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[07:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25945.68s)]
*  Keep going. [[07:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25947.48s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[07:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25948.48s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[07:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25954.48s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. [[07:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25956.079999999998s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[07:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25959.88s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[07:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25962.18s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted [[07:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25966.079999999998s)]
*  in our shared values. [[07:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25975.079999999998s)]
*  This, yeah. [[07:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25977.28s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. [[07:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25980.28s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[07:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25992.079999999998s)]
*  We need to come together. [[07:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25997.379999999997s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[07:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=25998.98s)]
*  We need to come together. [[07:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26001.28s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[07:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26002.28s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[07:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26004.18s)]
*  There it is. [[07:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26009.98s)]
*  En français, même en français. [[07:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26012.98s)]
*  Se protéger et bâtir, c'est ça. [[07:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26016.98s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum [[07:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26023.38s)]
*  in the United States. [[07:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26029.72s)]
*  Minimum. [[07:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26030.920000000002s)]
*  They asked for it. [[07:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26031.920000000002s)]
*  They're getting it. [[07:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26034.920000000002s)]
*  We need to protect. [[07:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26036.62s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[07:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26038.72s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[07:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26046.72s)]
*  Pierre Pauliet pocketed all the money. [[07:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26051.420000000002s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[07:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26053.420000000002s)]
*  And above all, above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[07:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26057.92s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[07:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26081.219999999998s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. [[07:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26083.52s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[07:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26091.72s)]
*  Some big changes. [[07:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26094.52s)]
*  And I'm ready to make them. [[07:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26095.52s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[07:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26097.82s)]
*  You can probably tell. [[07:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26100.82s)]
*  I am not a career politician. [[07:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26101.82s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[07:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26104.12s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[07:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26107.22s)]
*  Something's not working. [[07:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26112.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[07:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26117.02s)]
*  Homes, oh, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey, homes have become too expensive. [[07:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26123.02s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[07:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26129.02s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[07:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26131.02s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[07:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26136.52s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike. [[07:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26152.52s)]
*  What was that doing? [[07:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26157.52s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[07:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26159.52s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[07:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26161.52s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[07:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26163.52s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[07:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26166.02s)]
*  Too divisive. [[07:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26177.02s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[07:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26178.02s)]
*  The BC government followed up. [[07:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26181.02s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[07:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26186.02s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[07:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26191.52s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[07:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26197.52s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26203.52s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[07:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26210.52s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[07:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26220.02s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[07:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26227.02s)]
*  New relations, EU less dependent on the US. [[07:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26240.02s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. [[07:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26244.52s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[07:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26250.52s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[07:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26252.52s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[07:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26254.52s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[07:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26260.52s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[07:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26274.52s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[07:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26282.52s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[07:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26295.52s)]
*  Anything. [[07:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26303.02s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. [[07:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26304.02s)]
*  But if that's what it takes. [[07:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26309.02s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. [[07:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26311.02s)]
*  And my government will do its best. [[07:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26315.02s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. [[07:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26321.02s)]
*  Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[07:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26327.02s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[07:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26333.02s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[07:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26352.02s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[07:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26358.52s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[07:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26365.52s)]
*  That's what we need. [[07:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26375.52s)]
*  That's what we need. [[07:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26378.02s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[07:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26380.02s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. [[07:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26389.02s)]
*  Once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[07:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26396.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[07:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26408.02s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[07:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26421.02s)]
*  Turn them back at the border. [[07:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26427.02s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[07:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26429.52s)]
*  But at the same time we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[07:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26437.52s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves and we have to take care of each other. [[07:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26443.52s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[07:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26451.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26454.02s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. [[07:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26458.02s)]
*  But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[07:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26464.02s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, [[07:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26474.02s)]
*  just like in hockey, we will win. [[07:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26481.52s)]
*  We will win. [[07:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26490.52s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[07:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26494.52s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom and on the ice. [[07:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26500.52s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[07:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26506.52s)]
*  And what they stressed was... [[07:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26509.02s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[07:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26515.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26523.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26529.02s)]
*  You know, the lessons. [[07:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26531.02s)]
*  They stressed the importance. [[07:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26533.52s)]
*  They stressed the importance. [[07:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26537.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26541.52s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[07:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26549.52s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[07:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26553.52s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[07:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26557.52s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[07:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26560.52s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, [[07:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26563.02s)]
*  get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[07:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26569.02s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the US. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[07:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26576.02s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[07:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26583.02s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[07:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26590.02s)]
*  I supported these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[07:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26593.02s)]
*  And today, I support them to face President Trump and build a renewed economy [[07:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26601.02s)]
*  where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[07:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26612.02s)]
*  This bringing together of community values, this relying on the values. [[07:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26623.02s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[07:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26629.02s)]
*  Because... [[07:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26634.02s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. [[07:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26636.02s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[07:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26638.02s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[07:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26642.02s)]
*  I have though seen this movie before around the world. [[07:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26646.02s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market [[07:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26650.02s)]
*  despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[07:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26657.52s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[07:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26662.52s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind, [[07:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26667.52s)]
*  but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[07:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26671.52s)]
*  Let's say so. [[07:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26680.52s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[07:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26683.52s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[07:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26691.52s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[07:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26696.52s)]
*  Action. [[07:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26700.02s)]
*  We need time. That's right. [[07:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26701.02s)]
*  That's right. [[07:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26704.02s)]
*  Because negativity will not allow us to win a commercial war. [[07:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26706.02s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[07:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26714.02s)]
*  Negativity will not lower the price of the stock. [[07:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26719.02s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[07:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26724.02s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent, [[07:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26728.52s)]
*  it's not going to win a trade war, it will not make Canada strong. [[07:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26732.52s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[07:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26737.52s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. We will win this battle. [[07:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26745.52s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger. We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[07:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26749.52s)]
*  That's right. [[07:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26758.52s)]
*  You know what? [[07:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26762.52s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[07:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26765.52s)]
*  They want our resources. [[07:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26772.52s)]
*  They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. [[07:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26775.52s)]
*  They want our country. Never. Never. Never. Never. [[07:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26782.52s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[07:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26788.52s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[07:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26791.52s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[07:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26797.52s)]
*  America. [[07:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26799.52s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[07:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26804.52s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. [[07:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26807.52s)]
*  We're all Canadians. Look at this room. [[07:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26810.52s)]
*  We're all Canadians. The diversity. [[07:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26812.52s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[07:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26815.52s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. [[07:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26818.52s)]
*  In Canada, health care is a right. [[07:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26827.52s)]
*  In the US, we don't recognize differences. [[07:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26838.52s)]
*  We don't recognize the indigenous peoples. [[07:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26842.52s)]
*  And we will never forget the French language. [[07:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26846.02s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. And Canada will never ever be part of America. [[07:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26851.02s)]
*  So what do we do now? [[07:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26876.02s)]
*  Fight. [[07:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26877.02s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[07:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26879.02s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[07:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26883.02s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[07:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26890.02s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[07:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26896.02s)]
*  So we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[07:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26902.02s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[07:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26906.02s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. I've got someone in mind. [[07:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26909.02s)]
*  You're close. You're close. [[07:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26912.02s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[07:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26920.02s)]
*  No. [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26926.02s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, [[07:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26928.02s)]
*  who copies his ideas, and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[07:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26932.52s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing Canada [[07:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26944.52s)]
*  by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[07:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26951.52s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[07:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26958.52s)]
*  It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[07:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26962.52s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple of forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[07:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26965.52s)]
*  I don't know. Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[07:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26970.52s)]
*  So we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[07:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26980.52s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[07:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26987.52s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[07:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=26992.02s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[07:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27000.02s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[07:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27005.02s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[07:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27010.02s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel. [[07:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27015.02s)]
*  The anxieties we all feel. [[07:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27020.52s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face. [[07:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27022.52s)]
*  And overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[07:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27029.52s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[07:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27035.52s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs, [[07:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27040.52s)]
*  government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction. [[07:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27050.52s)]
*  To catalyze action and drive investment. [[07:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27069.52s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[07:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27076.02s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[07:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27088.02s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. [[07:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27092.02s)]
*  We got to start by making, making the government spend less. [[07:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27095.02s)]
*  So the Canadians can invest more. [[07:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27100.02s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[07:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27106.02s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[07:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27112.02s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[07:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27119.02s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes. [[07:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27123.52s)]
*  To make Canada a super power, to create a good career in specialized jobs. [[07:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27126.52s)]
*  To build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[07:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27133.52s)]
*  Our plan. [[07:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27140.52s)]
*  Our plan. [[07:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27143.52s)]
*  Our plan. [[07:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27146.52s)]
*  Till tomorrow. [[07:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27149.02s)]
*  Our plan. [[07:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27151.02s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[07:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27153.02s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war. [[07:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27156.02s)]
*  And it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[07:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27161.02s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[07:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27166.02s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[07:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27175.02s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[07:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27177.02s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[07:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27183.52s)]
*  Because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[07:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27186.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke, it's a joke. [[07:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27192.52s)]
*  I thought the same thing actually, same thing. [[07:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27194.52s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it actually. [[07:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27198.52s)]
*  Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. [[07:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27201.52s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[07:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27205.02s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws. [[07:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27213.02s)]
*  As Canada. [[07:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27217.02s)]
*  That's very clever. [[07:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27218.02s)]
*  Very subtle that. [[07:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27220.02s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[07:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27222.02s)]
*  I know the world's super power is attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[07:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27224.02s)]
*  Deal with the Americans. [[07:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27231.02s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[07:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27235.02s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy and an economy that works for everyone. [[07:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27241.02s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[07:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27249.02s)]
*  He wants to cut, he wants to cut what Canadians value. [[07:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27254.02s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[07:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27260.52s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[07:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27271.52s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[07:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27277.52s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working parents. [[07:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27287.02s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[07:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27297.02s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[07:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27301.02s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[07:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27307.02s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[07:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27310.02s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[07:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27313.52s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[07:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27321.52s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[07:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27329.52s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[07:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27335.02s)]
*  Now, Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[07:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27346.02s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[07:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27355.02s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[07:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27360.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[07:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27365.52s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[07:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27376.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[07:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27378.52s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[07:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27382.52s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[07:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27385.52s)]
*  No. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. [[07:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27389.02s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[07:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27397.02s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, that we can't give ourselves more than the Americans can ever take away. [[07:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27409.02s)]
*  As America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[07:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27419.02s)]
*  And we should. [[07:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27424.02s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[07:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27429.02s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about [[07:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27435.02s)]
*  why I care and why we as liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[07:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27441.52s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[07:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27449.52s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[07:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27455.52s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[07:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27458.52s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[07:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27462.02s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she had given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[07:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27468.02s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[07:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27478.02s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they had written. [[07:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27483.02s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[07:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27486.02s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. [[07:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27489.52s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[07:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27494.52s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like the kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[07:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27506.52s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[07:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27514.02s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[07:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27520.02s)]
*  Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[07:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27522.02s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[07:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27532.02s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[07:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27536.02s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[07:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27540.52s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[07:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27545.52s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[07:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27557.52s)]
*  That is what's at stake. [[07:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27566.02s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[07:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27571.02s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. [[07:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27582.02s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[07:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27585.02s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[07:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27591.52s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[07:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27601.52s)]
*  Canada has given me everything. [[07:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27615.52s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[07:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27619.02s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[07:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27624.02s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[07:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27641.02s)]
*  I know that's dangerous to say. [[07:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27646.52s)]
*  Good luck. [[07:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27649.52s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[07:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27653.52s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[07:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27656.52s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[07:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27666.52s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[07:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27670.52s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents [[07:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27673.02s)]
*  to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[07:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27680.02s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[07:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27686.02s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[07:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27698.02s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[07:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27703.02s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[07:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27706.02s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[07:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27709.02s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[07:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27712.02s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[07:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27715.02s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[07:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27720.02s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[07:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27725.02s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[07:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27731.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. Merci beaucoup. [[07:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27734.52s)]
*  All right. [[07:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27761.52s)]
*  Hello Surrey. Hello Cloverdale. [[07:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27765.52s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you Diana. [[07:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27770.52s)]
*  Not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[07:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27774.52s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls. [[07:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27779.52s)]
*  Trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[07:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27785.02s)]
*  Commitment and compassion as in everything that she does. [[07:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27789.02s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this all week. [[07:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27793.02s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. [[07:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27798.02s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing political party. [[07:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27802.02s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[07:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27808.52s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[07:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27823.52s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[07:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27838.52s)]
*  Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[07:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27845.52s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[07:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27856.02s)]
*  Okay, with this room I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[07:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27875.02s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. [[07:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27880.02s)]
*  Who is ready to stand their most steadfast ally? [[07:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27883.52s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. Keep going. [[07:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27886.52s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[07:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27889.52s)]
*  It is a tragedy. But it's also our new reality. [[07:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27895.52s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[07:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27900.52s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[07:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27902.52s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[07:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27906.02s)]
*  This, yeah. [[07:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27917.02s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. Serious leadership and a united country. [[07:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27920.52s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. [[07:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27937.52s)]
*  We need to come together. And I saw a sign that said this. [[07:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27941.52s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[07:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27945.02s)]
*  There it is. [[07:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27955.02s)]
*  In French, even in French. [[07:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27957.02s)]
*  To protect and to build, that's it. [[07:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27961.02s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[07:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27964.02s)]
*  Minimum in Canada. [[07:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27971.02s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. [[07:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27975.02s)]
*  We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses. [[07:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27977.02s)]
*  Using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. [[07:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27983.02s)]
*  Pierre Pauli have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[07:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27992.02s)]
*  And above all... [[07:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=27998.02s)]
*  Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie. [[07:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28005.02s)]
*  Above all... [[07:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28009.02s)]
*  Above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[07:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28013.02s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[07:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28021.02s)]
*  Now... [[07:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28024.02s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. [[07:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28029.02s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. Some big changes. And I'm ready to make them. [[07:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28031.52s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician. [[07:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28038.52s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[07:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28044.52s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[07:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28047.52s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[07:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28052.52s)]
*  Wow. [[07:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28055.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[07:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28058.02s)]
*  Homes... Boy, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey. [[07:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28064.02s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. So we are cutting taxes on them. [[07:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28067.02s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[07:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28072.02s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[07:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28076.02s)]
*  We saw... [[07:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28085.02s)]
*  We saw... [[07:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28087.02s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike... [[07:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28089.02s)]
*  What was that doing? It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[07:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28093.02s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[07:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28096.02s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[07:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28099.02s)]
*  We saw... [[07:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28101.02s)]
*  You know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax... [[07:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28103.02s)]
*  You know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax... [[07:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28108.52s)]
*  Looked good on paper, but it was too divisive. [[07:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28114.52s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. [[07:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28117.52s)]
*  The BC government followed up. [[07:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28122.52s)]
*  Premier Beby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[07:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28126.52s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[07:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28133.02s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[07:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28138.02s)]
*  Not your tax dollars. Them. [[07:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28144.02s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health care system so that 5 million more Canadians have benefited. [[07:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28151.02s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[07:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28160.52s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[07:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28167.52s)]
*  New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[07:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28180.52s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We've got lots of friends. [[07:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28185.02s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends. We've got others. [[07:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28192.02s)]
*  And we're going to make friends. [[07:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28195.02s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[07:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28201.02s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[07:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28215.02s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade and workers inside our own country. [[07:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28223.02s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[07:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28236.02s)]
*  Anything. [[07:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28243.52s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[07:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28244.52s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[07:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28250.52s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[07:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28261.52s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[07:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28273.52s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[07:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28292.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[07:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28299.02s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[07:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28307.02s)]
*  That's what we need. [[07:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28317.02s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[07:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28319.52s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[07:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28330.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[07:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28349.52s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[07:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28361.52s)]
*  Turn them back to the border. [[07:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28367.52s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[07:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28370.52s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[07:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28378.02s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. [[07:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28384.02s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[07:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28392.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28394.52s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. [[07:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28398.52s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[07:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28407.52s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[07:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28414.02s)]
*  We will win. [[07:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28430.02s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[07:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28434.02s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[07:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28440.52s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was... [[07:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28446.52s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[07:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28454.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28460.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28462.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28470.02s)]
*  You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. [[07:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28472.02s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[07:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28478.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28480.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28482.52s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[07:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28490.52s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[07:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28495.52s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[07:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28499.52s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28504.52s)]
*  play ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. [[07:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28510.52s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[07:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28516.52s)]
*  But these are... [[07:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28520.52s)]
*  These are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. [[07:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28524.52s)]
*  And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[07:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28530.52s)]
*  I was supported by these values when I managed crises in Canada and abroad. [[07:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28533.02s)]
*  And today... [[07:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28540.02s)]
*  And today I support them to face President Trump and build a renewed economy [[07:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28545.02s)]
*  where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[07:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28552.02s)]
*  This bringing together of community values, this relying on the values. [[07:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28563.02s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Pauliev gets any of this. [[07:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28569.02s)]
*  Because... [[07:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28574.02s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. Cut. Cut. [[07:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28576.02s)]
*  I know. I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[07:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28579.02s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[07:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28582.02s)]
*  I have though seen this movie before around the world. [[07:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28586.02s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market [[07:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28590.52s)]
*  despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[07:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28597.52s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[07:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28602.52s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[07:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28604.52s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind [[07:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28608.52s)]
*  but relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[07:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28612.02s)]
*  Say so. [[07:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28621.02s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[07:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28624.02s)]
*  We need... [[07:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28632.02s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[07:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28634.02s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[07:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28637.02s)]
*  Action. [[07:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28640.52s)]
*  We need... [[07:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28641.52s)]
*  That's right. [[07:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28642.52s)]
*  That's right. [[07:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28644.52s)]
*  Because negativity will not allow us to win a commercial war. [[07:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28646.52s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[07:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28654.52s)]
*  Negativity will not lower the price of the stock. [[07:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28659.52s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[07:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28664.52s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent. [[07:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28669.02s)]
*  It's not going to win a trade war. [[07:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28673.02s)]
*  It will not make Canada strong. [[07:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28675.02s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[07:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28678.02s)]
*  We resist. [[07:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28686.02s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[07:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28687.02s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[07:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28689.02s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger. [[07:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28690.02s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[07:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28692.02s)]
*  That's right. [[07:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28699.02s)]
*  You know what? [[07:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28703.02s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, they look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[07:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28706.02s)]
*  They want our resources. [[07:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28713.02s)]
*  They want our water. [[07:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28716.02s)]
*  That's right. [[07:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28718.02s)]
*  They want our land. [[07:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28719.02s)]
*  They want our country. [[07:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28720.02s)]
*  They want our country. [[07:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28723.02s)]
*  Never. [[07:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28724.02s)]
*  Never. [[07:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28725.02s)]
*  Never. [[07:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28726.02s)]
*  Never. [[07:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28727.02s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[07:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28729.02s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[07:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28732.02s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[07:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28738.02s)]
*  America. [[07:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28740.02s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[07:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28745.02s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[07:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28748.02s)]
*  Look at the diversity. [[07:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28750.02s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[07:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28751.02s)]
*  Look at this room. [[07:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28752.02s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[07:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28753.02s)]
*  The diversity. [[07:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28754.02s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[07:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28755.02s)]
*  You know, in the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[07:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28759.02s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[07:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28768.02s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[07:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28779.02s)]
*  We don't recognize the indigenous peoples. [[07:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28783.02s)]
*  And we will never forget the right to speak French. [[07:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28786.52s)]
*  The United States is not Canada and Canada will never ever be part of America. [[07:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28791.52s)]
*  Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[07:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28797.52s)]
*  So, having solved that, [[08:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28805.52s)]
*  having solved that, [[08:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28811.02s)]
*  he doesn't like that. [[08:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28813.02s)]
*  I know. [[08:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28814.02s)]
*  So, what do we do? [[08:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28815.02s)]
*  So, what do we do now? [[08:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28816.02s)]
*  Fight! [[08:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28817.02s)]
*  Fight. [[08:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28818.02s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[08:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28819.02s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[08:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28823.02s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[08:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28831.02s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[08:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28836.52s)]
*  So, we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[08:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28842.52s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[08:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28845.52s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[08:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28849.52s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[08:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28850.52s)]
*  You're close. [[08:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28852.52s)]
*  You're close. [[08:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28853.52s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[08:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28860.52s)]
*  No. [[08:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28866.52s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, [[08:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28867.52s)]
*  who copies his ideas, and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked [[08:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28872.52s)]
*  was to call Canada stupid. [[08:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28878.52s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind [[08:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28884.52s)]
*  to the growing threats facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, [[08:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28889.52s)]
*  to get his security clearance. [[08:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28895.02s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[08:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28899.02s)]
*  It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[08:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28903.02s)]
*  I had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[08:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28906.02s)]
*  I don't know. [[08:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28911.02s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[08:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28912.02s)]
*  I know. [[08:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28915.52s)]
*  So, we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[08:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28921.52s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[08:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28928.52s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[08:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28932.52s)]
*  Because, because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[08:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28939.02s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, [[08:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28946.02s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[08:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28950.52s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, [[08:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28955.02s)]
*  the anxieties we all feel. [[08:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28961.02s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty [[08:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28963.52s)]
*  that businesses face, and overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[08:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28968.52s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[08:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28976.52s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, [[08:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28981.52s)]
*  government needs, [[08:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28988.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=28993.52s)]
*  Government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction, [[08:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29004.52s)]
*  to catalyze action, and drive investment. [[08:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29010.52s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[08:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29017.02s)]
*  So, what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? [[08:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29029.02s)]
*  We start, we got to start at home. [[08:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29033.02s)]
*  We got to start by making, making the government spend less, [[08:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29036.02s)]
*  so that Canadians can invest more. [[08:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29041.02s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[08:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29047.02s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[08:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29053.02s)]
*  Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[08:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29059.02s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, [[08:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29063.52s)]
*  to make Canada a super power, to create a good career in specialized jobs, [[08:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29067.52s)]
*  to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[08:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29075.52s)]
*  Our plan, our plan, our plan, our plan, our plan, our plan, our plan, our plan, [[08:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29083.52s)]
*  our plan. There was a lot in that. [[08:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29091.02s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, [[08:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29096.02s)]
*  and it will usher in a new era of investment of jobs and growth. [[08:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29101.02s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[08:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29106.02s)]
*  That's what we mean. That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[08:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29114.52s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, [[08:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29124.52s)]
*  because the Conservatives finally released their platform yesterday. [[08:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29126.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke, it's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually. [[08:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29133.52s)]
*  Same thing. It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[08:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29137.52s)]
*  Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. [[08:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29142.02s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again, [[08:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29146.02s)]
*  Pierre Paulièvre has no plan to stand up to President Trump. [[08:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29149.02s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws, as Canada. [[08:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29154.02s)]
*  That's very clever. It's very subtle, that. [[08:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29159.02s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[08:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29163.02s)]
*  I know the world's superpower is attacking us, [[08:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29165.02s)]
*  but let's sort out the straw thing first, and then deal with the Americans. [[08:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29169.52s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[08:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29175.52s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, [[08:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29182.52s)]
*  an economy that works for everyone. [[08:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29187.52s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering, in the fight against climate change. [[08:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29189.52s)]
*  He wants to cut, he wants to cut what Canadians value. [[08:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29195.02s)]
*  Child care, dental care, pharma care, treatment for mental health and addictions, and the CBC. [[08:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29201.02s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut, that is never home. [[08:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29212.02s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years, after President Trump is due to leave office. [[08:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29218.52s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard working Canadians. [[08:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29228.52s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[08:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29237.52s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Paulièvre, I've managed budgets before. [[08:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29242.52s)]
*  I've managed economy. I've managed economies before. [[08:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29247.02s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[08:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29251.02s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[08:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29254.02s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[08:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29262.02s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[08:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29271.02s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[08:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29277.02s)]
*  Pierre Paulièvre and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[08:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29291.02s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[08:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29298.02s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[08:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29302.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[08:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29307.52s)]
*  It's possible, they could believe it. [[08:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29318.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[08:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29320.52s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, [[08:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29324.52s)]
*  to give the Americans what they want, and hope for the best. [[08:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29327.52s)]
*  No, no. Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not, that is not what makes Canada strong. [[08:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29332.52s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[08:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29342.52s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[08:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29350.02s)]
*  And we should. [[08:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29364.02s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[08:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29369.02s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about [[08:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29374.52s)]
*  why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[08:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29381.52s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. [[08:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29389.52s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[08:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29395.52s)]
*  And I want to give an example. From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment [[08:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29404.52s)]
*  that she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[08:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29415.52s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[08:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29419.52s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[08:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29423.52s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[08:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29426.52s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air and clean water, [[08:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29432.02s)]
*  or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[08:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29439.02s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[08:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29448.02s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[08:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29456.02s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[08:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29462.02s)]
*  Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[08:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29464.02s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[08:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29474.02s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[08:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29482.02s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[08:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29484.52s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[08:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29498.52s)]
*  That is what that states. [[08:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29508.52s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, [[08:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29511.02s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[08:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29519.02s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. [[08:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29522.02s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[08:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29526.02s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[08:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29531.52s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[08:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29537.52s)]
*  Canada, Canada, Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[08:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29548.52s)]
*  Canada, Canada has given me everything. [[08:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29556.02s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. [[08:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29560.02s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[08:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29565.02s)]
*  Wow. [[08:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29579.02s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[08:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29580.52s)]
*  I know that's dangerous to say. [[08:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29587.52s)]
*  Good luck. [[08:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29589.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[08:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29591.52s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[08:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29593.52s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, [[08:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29596.52s)]
*  I need your help. [[08:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29604.52s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[08:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29607.02s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[08:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29611.02s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29613.02s)]
*  to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[08:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29620.02s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[08:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29626.02s)]
*  Right? [[08:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29637.02s)]
*  You know what to do. [[08:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29639.02s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[08:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29640.02s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[08:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29643.02s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[08:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29646.02s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[08:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29648.02s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[08:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29650.02s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[08:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29653.02s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[08:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29659.02s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[08:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29665.02s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[08:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29671.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[08:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29674.52s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[08:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29676.52s)]
*  All right. [[08:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29695.52s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[08:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29699.52s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[08:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29701.52s)]

*  Thank you for all of your work on this campaign. [[08:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29725.02s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[08:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29727.02s)]
*  Commitment and compassion, as in everything that she does. [[08:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29737.02s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[08:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29741.02s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[08:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29743.02s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[08:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29745.02s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[08:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29748.02s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[08:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29750.52s)]
*  And it's great. [[08:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29757.52s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[08:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29764.52s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[08:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29780.52s)]
*  Who's ready? [[08:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29786.52s)]
*  Who is ready? [[08:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29788.52s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[08:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29790.52s)]
*  Who is ready? [[08:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29801.52s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[08:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29803.52s)]
*  Who is ready? [[08:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29810.52s)]
*  Okay, with this room, I think we got a shot. [[08:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29815.52s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[08:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29818.52s)]
*  But we need it. [[08:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29820.52s)]
*  Elbows up. [[08:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29822.52s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[08:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29824.52s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[08:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29826.52s)]
*  Keep going. [[08:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29828.52s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[08:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29830.52s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[08:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29835.52s)]
*  It's also our new reality. [[08:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29838.02s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[08:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29840.02s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[08:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29842.02s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[08:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29846.02s)]
*  This, yeah. [[08:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29858.02s)]
*  This, this, this is time for serious leadership. [[08:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29860.52s)]
*  Serious leadership and a united country. [[08:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29872.52s)]
*  We need to come together. [[08:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29877.52s)]
*  We need to come together, but we need to act. [[08:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29879.52s)]
*  We need to come together. [[08:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29882.52s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this. [[08:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29883.52s)]
*  We need to come together to fight, to protect, and to build Canada. [[08:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29886.02s)]
*  There it is. [[08:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29896.02s)]
*  En français, même en français. [[08:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29898.02s)]
*  Se battre, protéger, bâtir, c'est ça. [[08:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29902.02s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[08:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29904.02s)]
*  Minimum in France. [[08:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29912.02s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. [[08:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29914.52s)]
*  We need to protect. [[08:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29916.52s)]
*  We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. [[08:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29918.52s)]
*  Every single dollar. [[08:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29926.52s)]
*  Pierre Pauly have pocketed all the money. [[08:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29932.52s)]
*  We're going to send it to our workers. [[08:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29934.52s)]
*  And above all. [[08:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29938.52s)]
*  All right. [[08:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29944.52s)]
*  Above all. [[08:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29946.52s)]
*  Above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. [[08:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29950.52s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[08:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29958.52s)]
*  Now. [[08:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29961.52s)]
*  That's not necessarily going to be easy. [[08:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29966.52s)]
*  It's going to require some practice. [[08:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29969.52s)]
*  It's going to require some big changes. [[08:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29972.02s)]
*  Some big changes. [[08:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29974.02s)]
*  And I'm ready to make them. [[08:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29976.02s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. [[08:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29978.02s)]
*  You can probably tell. [[08:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29980.02s)]
*  I am not a career politician. [[08:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29982.02s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[08:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29984.02s)]
*  And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[08:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29986.02s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[08:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29988.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're going to do. [[08:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=29998.02s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[08:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30000.52s)]
*  Homes. [[08:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30004.52s)]
*  Boy, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey. [[08:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30006.52s)]
*  Homes have become too expensive. [[08:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30008.52s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on them. [[08:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30010.52s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. [[08:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30012.52s)]
*  We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, [[08:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30016.52s)]
*  BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[08:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30021.52s)]
*  We saw. [[08:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30030.52s)]
*  We saw. [[08:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30032.52s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike. [[08:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30034.52s)]
*  What was that doing? [[08:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30038.52s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. [[08:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30040.52s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[08:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30042.52s)]
*  So we got rid of it. [[08:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30044.52s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[08:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30046.52s)]
*  We saw. [[08:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30048.52s)]
*  You know, across this country, [[08:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30050.52s)]
*  the consumer carbon tax [[08:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30052.52s)]
*  looked good on paper, [[08:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30054.52s)]
*  but it was too divisive. [[08:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30056.52s)]
*  Too divisive. [[08:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30059.02s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. [[08:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30060.02s)]
*  The BC government followed up. [[08:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30062.02s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, [[08:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30067.02s)]
*  saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[08:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30069.02s)]
*  And what we're going to do, [[08:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30075.02s)]
*  doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change, [[08:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30077.02s)]
*  because we're going to get the big polluters [[08:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30079.02s)]
*  to pay you to save energy through home retrofit. [[08:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30081.02s)]
*  And I'm going to take some of your money. [[08:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30084.52s)]
*  Not your tax dollars. [[08:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30086.52s)]
*  Them. [[08:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30088.52s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian dental care system [[08:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30092.52s)]
*  so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[08:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30096.52s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[08:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30100.52s)]
*  We have. [[08:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30108.52s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations [[08:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30110.52s)]
*  with the European Union [[08:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30114.02s)]
*  so that our exporters [[08:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30116.02s)]
*  are less dependent on the United States. [[08:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30118.02s)]
*  New relations, EU, [[08:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30121.02s)]
*  less dependent on the US. [[08:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30123.02s)]
*  We are Canada. [[08:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30129.02s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[08:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30130.02s)]
*  We've got lots of friends. [[08:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30132.02s)]
*  America doesn't want to be our friends, we've got others. [[08:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30134.02s)]
*  And we're going to make them. [[08:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30136.02s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia [[08:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30138.52s)]
*  and strengthened our military cooperation [[08:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30142.52s)]
*  with France and the United Kingdom. [[08:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30145.52s)]
*  So, at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, [[08:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30152.52s)]
*  I brought together all the Premiers to Ottawa. [[08:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30156.52s)]
*  And we agreed to eliminate all the barriers [[08:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30160.52s)]
*  on trade and trade with the United Kingdom. [[08:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30163.52s)]
*  We agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade [[08:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30167.02s)]
*  and workers inside our own country. [[08:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30170.02s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, [[08:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30178.02s)]
*  when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[08:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30182.02s)]
*  Anything. [[08:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30186.02s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa. [[08:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30187.02s)]
*  Which is fair. [[08:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30191.02s)]
*  But if that's what it takes. [[08:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30192.02s)]
*  We're going to eliminate one Canadian economy, not 13. [[08:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30194.52s)]
*  And my government will do its best. [[08:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30197.52s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, [[08:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30203.52s)]
*  we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st, [[08:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30205.52s)]
*  free trade in Canada, by Canada Day. [[08:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30209.52s)]
*  So, in nine days of government, [[08:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30218.52s)]
*  before the election, nine days of government, [[08:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30221.52s)]
*  more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[08:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30223.52s)]
*  Now, and that's it. [[08:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30232.52s)]
*  If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[08:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30236.02s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[08:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30240.02s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[08:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30241.02s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[08:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30242.02s)]
*  That's what it looks like to me. [[08:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30244.02s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[08:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30246.02s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together [[08:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30248.02s)]
*  over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[08:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30252.02s)]
*  That's what we need. [[08:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30258.02s)]
*  Because... [[08:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30261.52s)]
*  We need, in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[08:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30265.52s)]
*  Because, as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office. [[08:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30271.52s)]
*  Once again today in the Oval Office, [[08:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30278.52s)]
*  President Trump, he is trying to break us [[08:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30280.52s)]
*  so that America can own us. [[08:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30284.02s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. [[08:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30292.02s)]
*  That's the answer, Donald. [[08:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30293.52s)]
*  That will never happen. [[08:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30295.02s)]
*  Ever. [[08:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30297.02s)]
*  They're gonna have to come through Surrey. [[08:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30302.52s)]
*  They're not gonna make it. [[08:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30304.52s)]
*  They're not gonna make it through Surrey. [[08:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30305.52s)]
*  Turn him back to the border. [[08:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30308.52s)]
*  But you know what? [[08:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30311.02s)]
*  I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, [[08:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30313.02s)]
*  we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[08:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30316.02s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[08:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30319.02s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. [[08:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30325.02s)]
*  And we have to take care of each other. [[08:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30328.02s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[08:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30332.52s)]
*  You know... [[08:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30338.52s)]
*  We didn't ask for this fight. [[08:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30342.02s)]
*  But Canada's strong. [[08:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30345.52s)]
*  I'll tell you... [[08:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30347.52s)]
*  I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[08:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30349.02s)]
*  And what the Americans... [[08:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30355.02s)]
*  What they're gonna find out is in this trade war, [[08:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30358.02s)]
*  just like in hockey, we will win. [[08:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30362.52s)]
*  We will win. [[08:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30368.02s)]
*  We will win. [[08:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30371.02s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up... [[08:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30375.02s)]
*  Hockey played a big part of my life. [[08:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30379.02s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, [[08:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30382.02s)]
*  in the classroom, and on the ice. [[08:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30385.02s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[08:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30388.02s)]
*  And what... [[08:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30390.02s)]
*  And what they stressed was... [[08:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30392.02s)]
*  What my... [[08:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30395.02s)]
*  I'm talking about my... [[08:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30397.52s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[08:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30399.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30404.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30410.52s)]
*  You know, the lessons... [[08:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30412.52s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[08:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30415.52s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[08:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30418.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30422.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30427.52s)]
*  You know, the importance of... [[08:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30431.52s)]
*  The importance of working hard. [[08:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30433.52s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[08:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30435.52s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[08:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30439.52s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[08:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30441.52s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, [[08:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30443.52s)]
*  they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, [[08:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30448.52s)]
*  be ambitious, and, this being Canada, stay humble. [[08:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30451.52s)]
*  Right? [[08:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30456.02s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. [[08:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30457.02s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[08:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30459.02s)]
*  But these are... [[08:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30461.02s)]
*  These are... [[08:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30464.02s)]
*  These are Surrey values. [[08:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30466.02s)]
*  These are Canadian values. [[08:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30468.02s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[08:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30470.02s)]
*  I took them with me. [[08:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30472.02s)]
*  I relied on these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[08:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30474.02s)]
*  And today... [[08:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30482.02s)]
*  And today I rely on these values to face President Trump [[08:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30484.52s)]
*  and build a renewed economy [[08:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30489.52s)]
*  where everyone can succeed in a world that has been deeply transformed. [[08:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30492.52s)]
*  Now... [[08:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30501.52s)]
*  This bringing together of community values, [[08:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30503.52s)]
*  this relying on the values, [[08:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30506.52s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[08:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30510.02s)]
*  Because... [[08:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30515.02s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[08:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30516.02s)]
*  I know, I know. [[08:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30519.02s)]
*  I don't get it either. I don't get it. [[08:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30521.02s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[08:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30523.02s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world [[08:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30527.02s)]
*  because there is a type of lifelong politician [[08:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30531.02s)]
*  who worships at the altar of the free market [[08:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30535.02s)]
*  despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[08:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30538.52s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[08:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30543.52s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[08:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30545.52s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind [[08:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30548.52s)]
*  but relies on his reflex to always cut, [[08:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30552.52s)]
*  to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[08:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30556.52s)]
*  I say... I say so. [[08:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30561.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[08:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30563.52s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, [[08:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30565.02s)]
*  we need solutions, not slogans. [[08:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30568.02s)]
*  We need... [[08:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30573.02s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[08:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30574.02s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[08:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30577.02s)]
*  Action... [[08:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30581.02s)]
*  We need... [[08:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30582.02s)]
*  That's it. [[08:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30585.02s)]
*  Because... [[08:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30586.02s)]
*  Because... [[08:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30587.02s)]
*  Because negativity [[08:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30588.02s)]
*  will not allow us to win a commercial war. [[08:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30590.52s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[08:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30594.52s)]
*  Negativity will not lower the price of the stock. [[08:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30599.52s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[08:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30604.52s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, [[08:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30609.52s)]
*  it's not going to pay the rent, [[08:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30611.52s)]
*  it's not going to win a trade war, [[08:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30613.52s)]
*  it will not make Canada strong. [[08:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30615.52s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US [[08:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30618.02s)]
*  with this politics, [[08:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30620.02s)]
*  it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. [[08:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30622.02s)]
*  We resist. We will win this battle. [[08:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30626.02s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[08:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30629.02s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger, [[08:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30631.02s)]
*  we will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[08:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30633.02s)]
*  You know what? [[08:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30643.02s)]
*  When the Americans look... [[08:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30645.52s)]
*  Look to Canada, look to British Columbia, [[08:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30647.52s)]
*  it's our strength that they want. [[08:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30650.52s)]
*  They want our resources. [[08:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30653.52s)]
*  They want our water. [[08:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30655.52s)]
*  That's right. They want our land. [[08:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30658.52s)]
*  They want our country. [[08:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30660.52s)]
*  They want our country. Never. [[08:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30662.52s)]
*  Never. Never. Never. [[08:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30664.52s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[08:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30668.52s)]
*  But most fundamentally, [[08:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30672.02s)]
*  because Canada is not America. [[08:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=30674.02s)]

*  Canadian over the next five years. [[08:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31052.52s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[08:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31054.52s)]
*  That's what we mean. [[08:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31056.52s)]
*  When we say [[08:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31058.52s)]
*  we're making Canada strong [[08:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31060.52s)]
*  together. [[08:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31062.52s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison. [[08:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31064.52s)]
*  Because the [[08:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31066.52s)]
*  Conservatives finally [[08:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31068.52s)]
*  released their platform yesterday. [[08:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31070.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[08:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31072.52s)]
*  It's a joke. It's a joke. [[08:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31074.52s)]
*  I thought the same thing actually. [[08:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31076.52s)]
*  Same thing. It didn't take me long [[08:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31078.52s)]
*  to read it actually. [[08:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31080.52s)]
*  Lots of pictures. Lots of pictures [[08:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31082.52s)]
*  of Pierre. [[08:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31084.52s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated [[08:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31086.52s)]
*  that once again Pierre Polyev [[08:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31088.52s)]
*  has no plan to stand up [[08:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31090.52s)]
*  to President Trump. [[08:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31092.52s)]
*  He is literally grasping [[08:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31094.52s)]
*  at straws. [[08:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31096.52s)]
*  As Canada. That's very clever. [[08:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31098.52s)]
*  It's very subtle that. [[08:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31100.52s)]
*  That's the big issue [[08:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31102.52s)]
*  of our day. [[08:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31104.52s)]
*  I know the world's [[08:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31106.52s)]
*  super powers attacking us. [[08:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31108.52s)]
*  But let's sort out the straw thing first. [[08:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31110.52s)]
*  We'll deal with the Americans. [[08:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31112.52s)]
*  He's offering Canadians [[08:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31116.52s)]
*  a fantasy of fiscal tricks [[08:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31118.52s)]
*  and phantom growth. [[08:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31120.52s)]
*  He's ignoring [[08:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31122.52s)]
*  the investments that we need [[08:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31124.52s)]
*  to build the strongest economy. An economy [[08:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31126.52s)]
*  that works for everyone. [[08:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31128.52s)]
*  He's surrendering. Literally surrendering [[08:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31130.52s)]
*  in the fight against climate change. [[08:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31132.52s)]
*  He wants to cut. He wants to cut [[08:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31136.52s)]
*  what Canadians [[08:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31138.52s)]
*  value. Childcare. [[08:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31140.52s)]
*  Dental care. Pharmacare. [[08:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31142.52s)]
*  Treatment for mental health and addictions [[08:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31144.52s)]
*  and the CBC. [[08:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31146.52s)]
*  He has a [[08:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31152.52s)]
*  bring it home tax cut [[08:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31154.52s)]
*  that is never home. [[08:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31156.52s)]
*  It won't arrive [[08:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31158.52s)]
*  for four years. [[08:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31160.52s)]
*  After [[08:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31162.52s)]
*  President Trump is due to leave [[08:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31164.52s)]
*  office. [[08:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31166.52s)]
*  It's not a solution. Our tax cut [[08:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31168.52s)]
*  shows up July 1 by the way. [[08:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31170.52s)]
*  $825 for hard working Canadians. [[08:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31172.52s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist [[08:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31176.52s)]
*  you do something, you do it right away. [[08:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31178.52s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Pauliev [[08:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31180.52s)]
*  I've managed budgets before. [[08:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31182.52s)]
*  I've managed [[08:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31184.52s)]
*  economy. I've managed [[08:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31186.52s)]
*  economies before. [[08:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31188.52s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[08:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31190.52s)]
*  And I know [[08:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31192.52s)]
*  that in a crisis you build [[08:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31194.52s)]
*  forward, you don't cut back. [[08:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31196.52s)]
*  A crisis [[08:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31200.52s)]
*  is a time [[08:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31202.52s)]
*  for bold action [[08:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31204.52s)]
*  not tired ideology. [[08:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31206.52s)]
*  A crisis [[08:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31208.52s)]
*  is a time to come together [[08:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31210.52s)]
*  not to sew division. [[08:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31212.52s)]
*  A crisis [[08:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31216.52s)]
*  is a time [[08:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31218.52s)]
*  for experience [[08:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31220.52s)]
*  not experiments. [[08:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31222.52s)]
*  Now [[08:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31224.52s)]
*  Pierre [[08:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31228.52s)]
*  Pauliev and Mr. [[08:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31230.52s)]
*  Pauliev and Mr. [[08:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31232.52s)]
*  Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has [[08:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31234.52s)]
*  some allies in Canada. [[08:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31236.52s)]
*  They don't like our plan to stand [[08:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31238.52s)]
*  up to President Trump. [[08:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31240.52s)]
*  And you know, to be [[08:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31242.52s)]
*  charitable, maybe they believe what [[08:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31244.52s)]
*  they're saying. [[08:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31246.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way [[08:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31248.52s)]
*  to defend ourselves is [[08:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31250.52s)]
*  to leave every Canadian [[08:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31252.52s)]
*  to fend for themselves. [[08:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31254.52s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[08:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31258.52s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just [[08:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31260.52s)]
*  go along to get along. [[08:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31262.52s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis [[08:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31264.52s)]
*  is to keep our heads down. [[08:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31266.52s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want [[08:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31268.52s)]
*  and hope for the best. [[08:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31270.52s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? [[08:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31274.52s)]
*  No. That is not [[08:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31276.52s)]
*  that is not what we'll make [[08:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31278.52s)]
*  Canada strong. [[08:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31280.52s)]
*  I know, we know, [[08:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31282.52s)]
*  we can give ourselves far [[08:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31284.52s)]
*  more than the Americans can ever [[08:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31286.52s)]
*  take away. [[08:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31288.52s)]
*  I know, I know, [[08:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31296.52s)]
*  we know, as America [[08:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31298.52s)]
*  retreats from the world, [[08:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31300.52s)]
*  Canada can lead it. [[08:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31302.52s)]
*  And we should. [[08:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31304.52s)]
*  The choice, I think the [[08:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31310.52s)]
*  choice in this election could not be clear. [[08:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31312.52s)]
*  Now, [[08:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31314.52s)]
*  I talk a lot about a strong [[08:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31316.52s)]
*  economy and before I wrap up, [[08:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31318.52s)]
*  I want to say a few words about [[08:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31320.52s)]
*  why I care and why we [[08:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31322.52s)]
*  as liberals, why we as Canadians [[08:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31324.52s)]
*  care about building a strong economy. [[08:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31326.52s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[08:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31330.52s)]
*  It's because we care [[08:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31332.52s)]
*  about people. [[08:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31334.52s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[08:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31336.52s)]
*  We know we are [[08:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31338.52s)]
*  all in this together. [[08:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31340.52s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[08:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31344.52s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, [[08:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31346.52s)]
*  I met a teacher in Ontario [[08:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31348.52s)]
*  who told me about a routine assignment [[08:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31350.52s)]
*  that she'd given to her 9 and 10 year old students. [[08:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31352.52s)]
*  And the kids were asked [[08:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31356.52s)]
*  to describe their dreams for Canada. [[08:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31358.52s)]
*  She gave me the papers [[08:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31360.52s)]
*  that they'd written. [[08:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31362.52s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country [[08:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31364.52s)]
*  free of poverty. [[08:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31366.52s)]
*  Others [[08:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31368.52s)]
*  wrote about the [[08:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31370.52s)]
*  poverty that they had. [[08:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31372.52s)]
*  Others [[08:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31374.52s)]
*  dreamt of [[08:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31376.52s)]
*  clean air and clean water [[08:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31378.52s)]
*  or a place where everyone enjoyed [[08:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31380.52s)]
*  equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[08:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31382.52s)]
*  These kids, [[08:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31390.52s)]
*  like kids here, kids there, [[08:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31392.52s)]
*  well brought up, well taught. [[08:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31394.52s)]
*  Because what they're expressing [[08:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31396.52s)]
*  is what we all want for ourselves, [[08:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31398.52s)]
*  what we all want for each other. [[08:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31400.52s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[08:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31402.52s)]
*  Is that many of these [[08:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31404.52s)]
*  cards [[08:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31406.52s)]
*  the kids wrote about [[08:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31408.52s)]
*  tariffs [[08:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31410.52s)]
*  and threats to our sovereignty. [[08:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31412.52s)]
*  And those are words [[08:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31414.52s)]
*  I had not met [[08:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31416.52s)]
*  at their age. Those are words I did not know [[08:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31418.52s)]
*  when I was 9 and 10 years old. [[08:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31420.52s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[08:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31422.52s)]
*  I dream [[08:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31426.52s)]
*  of a safe, [[08:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31428.52s)]
*  a kind, and a clean [[08:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31430.52s)]
*  Canada. [[08:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31432.52s)]
*  And then the child goes on. [[08:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31438.52s)]
*  Goes on [[08:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31440.52s)]
*  and says, a Canada [[08:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31442.52s)]
*  that is not the United [[08:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31444.52s)]
*  States. [[08:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31446.52s)]
*  That is [[08:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31448.52s)]
*  what that states. [[08:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31450.52s)]
*  You know, [[08:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31452.52s)]
*  our children, our children [[08:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31454.52s)]
*  should be able to dream [[08:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31456.52s)]
*  about a positive future, not [[08:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31458.52s)]
*  worry about an economic crisis. [[08:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31460.52s)]
*  So, [[08:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31462.52s)]
*  well I know these times are unsettling. [[08:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31464.52s)]
*  I also know that we can [[08:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31466.52s)]
*  give our children that future [[08:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31468.52s)]
*  the future they deserve. [[08:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31470.52s)]
*  And not, not because [[08:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31474.52s)]
*  it's easy. [[08:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31476.52s)]
*  Not because it'll be easy, but because [[08:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31478.52s)]
*  it is right. [[08:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31480.52s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here [[08:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31482.52s)]
*  before you. [[08:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31484.52s)]
*  You know. [[08:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31486.52s)]
*  Canada. [[08:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31490.52s)]
*  Canada. [[08:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31492.52s)]
*  Canada. [[08:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31494.52s)]
*  Canada. Canada has [[08:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31496.52s)]
*  given me everything. [[08:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31498.52s)]
*  My family. [[08:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31500.52s)]
*  My education. And my values. [[08:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31502.52s)]
*  And in return, [[08:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31504.52s)]
*  I'm ready to give [[08:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31506.52s)]
*  my everything to Canada. [[08:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31508.52s)]
*  Wow. [[08:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31514.52s)]
*  Sorry, [[08:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31520.52s)]
*  I teared up a bit [[08:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31522.52s)]
*  because I saw an Euler's [[08:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31524.52s)]
*  sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know [[08:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31526.52s)]
*  that's, I know it's dangerous to say. [[08:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31528.52s)]
*  Good luck. [[08:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31530.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's not. [[08:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31532.52s)]
*  Okay, yes. [[08:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31534.52s)]
*  Soon, soon. Look. [[08:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31536.52s)]
*  But, [[08:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31538.52s)]
*  in seriousness, for, to do [[08:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31540.52s)]
*  everything, to give everything, to deliver [[08:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31542.52s)]
*  this plan, [[08:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31544.52s)]
*  I need your help. [[08:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31546.52s)]
*  Because there are only five days [[08:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31548.52s)]
*  left in this campaign. Only five [[08:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31550.52s)]
*  days left in this campaign. [[08:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31552.52s)]
*  And I know a number of you, [[08:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31554.52s)]
*  I can see you, a number of you have [[08:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31556.52s)]
*  already given so much of your time [[08:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31558.52s)]
*  and talents to build a better [[08:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31560.52s)]
*  Surrey, a better Cloverdale, [[08:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31562.52s)]
*  and to fight for our country's future. [[08:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31564.52s)]
*  But to use, [[08:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31566.52s)]
*  to use a hockey analogy, [[08:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31568.52s)]
*  there are five minutes left [[08:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31570.52s)]
*  in the third period of game seven [[08:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31572.52s)]
*  of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[08:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31574.52s)]
*  You know what to do. [[08:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31578.52s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[08:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31580.52s)]
*  That means knocking on [[08:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31582.52s)]
*  more doors. [[08:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31584.52s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[08:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31586.52s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[08:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31588.52s)]
*  And it means to vote liberal. [[08:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31590.52s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, [[08:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31592.52s)]
*  the people of D.C. [[08:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31594.52s)]
*  could decide the next Prime Minister. [[08:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31596.52s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote [[08:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31598.52s)]
*  to protect the values [[08:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31600.52s)]
*  that we share. [[08:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31602.52s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up [[08:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31604.52s)]
*  to Donald Trump, to build [[08:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31606.52s)]
*  a united Canada that works [[08:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31608.52s)]

*  necessarily going to be easy. [[08:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31910.52s)]
*  It's going to require some [[08:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31912.52s)]
*  big changes. [[08:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31914.52s)]

*  I'm not a career politician, [[08:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31920.52s)]
*  you can probably tell. I am not a career [[08:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31922.52s)]

*  a pragmatist. [[08:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31926.52s)]
*  And so, when I [[08:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31928.52s)]
*  see something that's not working, [[08:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31930.52s)]
*  I change it. Something's not working, [[08:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31932.52s)]
*  I change it. [[08:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31934.52s)]
*  And that's [[08:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31938.52s)]
*  exactly what I did [[08:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31940.52s)]
*  as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[08:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31942.52s)]
*  Homes, oh I don't [[08:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31944.52s)]
*  need to tell you this here, I'm sorry, [[08:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31946.52s)]
*  homes have become too expensive. [[08:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31948.52s)]
*  So we are cutting taxes on [[08:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31950.52s)]
*  them, and we have set out [[08:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31952.52s)]
*  a strategy to build twice [[08:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31954.52s)]
*  as many homes. We're going to build [[08:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31956.52s)]
*  half a million homes a year using [[08:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31958.52s)]
*  BC technology, BC [[08:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31960.52s)]

*  capital gains tax hike, [[08:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31976.52s)]
*  what was that doing? [[08:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31978.52s)]
*  It was stifling builders, the very builders [[08:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31980.52s)]
*  we need. It was holding back [[08:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31982.52s)]
*  innovators. So we got rid of it. [[08:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31984.52s)]
*  We got rid of it. [[08:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31986.52s)]
*  We saw, you know, [[08:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31988.52s)]
*  across this country, [[08:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31990.52s)]
*  the consumer carbon tax [[08:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31992.52s)]
*  looked good on paper, [[08:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31994.52s)]
*  but it was too divisive. [[08:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31996.52s)]
*  Too divisive. So we eliminated [[08:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=31998.52s)]
*  it on day one. [[08:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32000.52s)]

*  So [[09:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32686.52s)]
*  having solved [[09:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32688.52s)]

*  you have to prepare [[09:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32706.52s)]
*  for the worst, not hope for the best. [[09:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32708.52s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what [[09:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=32712.52s)]

*  I thought the same thing actually. [[09:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33016.52s)]
*  Same thing. [[09:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33018.52s)]
*  Didn't take me long to read it actually. [[09:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33020.52s)]
*  Lots of pictures. [[09:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33022.52s)]
*  Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[09:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33024.52s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated [[09:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33026.52s)]
*  that once again Pierre [[09:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33028.52s)]
*  Poliev has no plan to stand up [[09:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33030.52s)]

*  As Canada. [[09:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33038.52s)]
*  That's very clever. Very subtle that. [[09:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33040.52s)]
*  That's the big [[09:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33042.52s)]
*  issue of our day. [[09:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33044.52s)]
*  I know the world's [[09:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33046.52s)]
*  superpowers attacking us [[09:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33048.52s)]
*  but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[09:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33050.52s)]
*  We're going to deal with the Americans. [[09:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33052.52s)]
*  He's offering Canadians [[09:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33056.52s)]
*  a fantasy of fiscal [[09:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33058.52s)]
*  tricks and phantom growth. [[09:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33060.52s)]
*  He's ignoring [[09:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33062.52s)]
*  the investments that we need [[09:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33064.52s)]

*  An economy that works for everyone. [[09:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33068.52s)]
*  He's surrendering. [[09:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33070.52s)]
*  Literally surrendering in the fight [[09:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33072.52s)]
*  against climate change. [[09:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33074.52s)]

*  He wants to cut [[09:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33078.52s)]
*  what Canadians value. [[09:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33080.52s)]
*  Child care. Dental care. [[09:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33082.52s)]
*  Pharmacare. Treatment for mental health [[09:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33084.52s)]

*  It won't arrive [[09:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33098.52s)]
*  for four years. [[09:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33100.52s)]

*  President Trump is due [[09:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33104.52s)]
*  to leave office. [[09:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33106.52s)]

*  They could believe it. Maybe they believe [[09:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33200.52s)]
*  that we should just go along to [[09:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33202.52s)]
*  get along. That the way to get [[09:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33204.52s)]
*  through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[09:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33206.52s)]
*  To give the Americans what they [[09:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33208.52s)]
*  want and hope for the best. [[09:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33210.52s)]
*  No. No. Anyone? [[09:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33214.52s)]
*  Any takers? No. [[09:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33216.52s)]
*  That is not. That is not [[09:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33218.52s)]
*  what makes Canada strong. [[09:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33220.52s)]
*  I know. We know. [[09:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33222.52s)]
*  We can give ourselves far [[09:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33224.52s)]
*  more than the Americans can [[09:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33226.52s)]
*  ever take away. [[09:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33228.52s)]
*  I know. [[09:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33236.52s)]
*  I know. We know. [[09:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33238.52s)]
*  As America retreats from [[09:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33240.52s)]
*  the world, Canada can lead it. [[09:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33242.52s)]
*  And we should. [[09:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33244.52s)]
*  The choice [[09:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33250.52s)]
*  I think the choice in this election could not [[09:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33252.52s)]
*  be clear. [[09:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33254.52s)]
*  Now, [[09:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33256.52s)]
*  I talk a lot about a strong economy. [[09:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33258.52s)]
*  And before I wrap up, I want to say a few words [[09:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33260.52s)]
*  about why I [[09:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33262.52s)]
*  care and why we as Liberals, [[09:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33264.52s)]
*  why we as Canadians care about [[09:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33266.52s)]
*  building a strong economy. [[09:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33268.52s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[09:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33270.52s)]
*  It's because [[09:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33272.52s)]
*  we care about people. [[09:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33274.52s)]
*  That value of community [[09:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33276.52s)]
*  that we all share. [[09:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33278.52s)]
*  We know we are all in this [[09:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33280.52s)]
*  together. [[09:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33282.52s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[09:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33288.52s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, [[09:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33290.52s)]
*  I met a teacher in Ontario [[09:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33292.52s)]
*  who told me about a routine assignment [[09:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33294.52s)]
*  that she'd given to her [[09:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33296.52s)]
*  nine and ten year old students. [[09:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33298.52s)]
*  And the kids were asked [[09:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33300.52s)]
*  to describe their dreams for [[09:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33302.52s)]
*  Canada. She gave me the [[09:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33304.52s)]
*  papers that they'd written. [[09:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33306.52s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country [[09:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33308.52s)]
*  free of poverty. [[09:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33310.52s)]
*  Others [[09:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33312.52s)]
*  dreamt [[09:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33314.52s)]
*  of clean [[09:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33316.52s)]
*  air and clean water. [[09:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33318.52s)]
*  Or a place where everyone enjoyed [[09:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33320.52s)]
*  equal rights, dignity, and [[09:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33322.52s)]
*  respect. [[09:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33324.52s)]
*  These kids [[09:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33328.52s)]
*  like [[09:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33330.52s)]
*  kids here, kids there, [[09:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33332.52s)]
*  well brought up, well taught. [[09:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33334.52s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is [[09:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33336.52s)]
*  what we all want for ourselves, [[09:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33338.52s)]
*  what we all want for each other. [[09:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33340.52s)]
*  But you know what struck me? [[09:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33342.52s)]
*  Is that many of these [[09:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33344.52s)]
*  cards, [[09:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33346.52s)]
*  the kids wrote [[09:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33348.52s)]
*  about tariffs [[09:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33350.52s)]
*  and threats to our sovereignty. [[09:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33352.52s)]
*  And those are words [[09:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33354.52s)]
*  I had not met [[09:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33356.52s)]
*  at their age. Those are words I did not [[09:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33358.52s)]
*  know when I was nine and ten years old. [[09:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33360.52s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[09:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33362.52s)]
*  I dream [[09:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33366.52s)]
*  of a safe, [[09:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33368.52s)]
*  a kind, and a clean [[09:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33370.52s)]
*  Canada. [[09:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33372.52s)]
*  And then the child goes on. [[09:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33378.52s)]
*  Goes on and says, [[09:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33380.52s)]
*  a Canada [[09:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33382.52s)]
*  that is not the United States. [[09:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33384.52s)]
*  You know, [[09:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33390.52s)]
*  our children, [[09:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33392.52s)]
*  our children, [[09:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33394.52s)]
*  our children should be able to dream [[09:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33396.52s)]
*  about a positive future, [[09:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33398.52s)]
*  not worry about an economic crisis. [[09:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33400.52s)]
*  So, [[09:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33402.52s)]
*  well I know these times [[09:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33404.52s)]
*  are unsettling. I also know that [[09:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33406.52s)]
*  we can give our children [[09:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33408.52s)]
*  that future, the future they deserve. [[09:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33410.52s)]
*  And not [[09:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33414.52s)]
*  because, not because [[09:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33416.52s)]
*  it's easy, not because it'll be easy, [[09:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33418.52s)]
*  but because it is right. [[09:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33420.52s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here [[09:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33422.52s)]
*  before you. [[09:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33424.52s)]
*  You know. [[09:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33426.52s)]
*  Canada, [[09:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33430.52s)]
*  Canada, [[09:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33432.52s)]
*  Canada, [[09:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33434.52s)]
*  Canada has [[09:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33436.52s)]
*  given me everything. [[09:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33438.52s)]
*  My family, [[09:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33440.52s)]
*  my education, and my [[09:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33442.52s)]
*  values. And in return, [[09:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33444.52s)]
*  I'm ready to give [[09:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33446.52s)]
*  my everything to [[09:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33448.52s)]
*  Canada. [[09:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33450.52s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw [[09:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33462.52s)]
*  an oiler's sweater up there. [[09:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33466.52s)]
*  I know that's dangerous to say. [[09:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33468.52s)]
*  Good luck. [[09:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33472.52s)]
*  Okay, yes. [[09:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33474.52s)]
*  Soon, soon. [[09:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33476.52s)]
*  Look, but [[09:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33478.52s)]
*  in seriousness, [[09:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33480.52s)]
*  to do everything, to give everything, [[09:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33482.52s)]
*  to deliver this plan, [[09:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33484.52s)]
*  I need your help. [[09:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33486.52s)]
*  Because there are only five [[09:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33488.52s)]
*  days left in this campaign. [[09:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33490.52s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[09:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33492.52s)]
*  And I know a number of you [[09:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33494.52s)]
*  can see you. A number of you [[09:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33496.52s)]
*  have already given so much of your [[09:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33498.52s)]
*  time and talents to build a [[09:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33500.52s)]
*  better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, [[09:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33502.52s)]
*  and to fight for our country's [[09:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33504.52s)]
*  future. But to use [[09:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33506.52s)]
*  a hockey analogy, [[09:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33508.52s)]
*  there are five [[09:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33510.52s)]
*  minutes left in the third [[09:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33512.52s)]
*  period of game seven of the Stanley Cup [[09:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33514.52s)]
*  final. [[09:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33516.52s)]
*  You know what to do. [[09:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33518.52s)]
*  It is time to leave [[09:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33520.52s)]
*  everything on the ice. [[09:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33522.52s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[09:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33524.52s)]
*  It means making more phone [[09:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33526.52s)]
*  calls. It means talking to your friends [[09:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33528.52s)]
*  and families. And it means [[09:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33530.52s)]
*  to vote Liberal. [[09:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33532.52s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, [[09:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33534.52s)]
*  the people of D.C. could decide [[09:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33536.52s)]
*  the next Prime Minister. [[09:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33538.52s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote [[09:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33540.52s)]
*  to protect the values [[09:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33542.52s)]
*  that we share. I'm asking [[09:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33544.52s)]
*  for your vote to stand up to Donald [[09:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33546.52s)]
*  Trump, to build a united [[09:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33548.52s)]
*  Canada that works for all. [[09:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33550.52s)]
*  Let's build Canada [[09:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33552.52s)]
*  strong. [[09:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33554.52s)]

*  above all, [[09:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33822.52s)]
*  in B.C. [[09:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33824.52s)]
*  and across Canada, [[09:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33826.52s)]
*  we need to unite [[09:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33828.52s)]
*  to build Canada strong. [[09:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33830.52s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[09:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33832.52s)]
*  Now, [[09:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33834.52s)]
*  we need to [[09:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33838.52s)]
*  unite to build Canada strong. [[09:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33840.52s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[09:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33842.52s)]
*  Now, [[09:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33844.52s)]
*  that's not [[09:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33846.52s)]
*  necessarily going to be easy. [[09:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33848.52s)]
*  It's going to require [[09:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33850.52s)]
*  some big changes. [[09:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33852.52s)]
*  Some big changes. And I'm ready [[09:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33854.52s)]
*  to make them. [[09:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33856.52s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career [[09:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33858.52s)]
*  politician. You can probably tell. [[09:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33860.52s)]
*  I am not a career politician. [[09:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33862.52s)]
*  But I am a pragmatist. [[09:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33864.52s)]
*  And so, [[09:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33866.52s)]
*  and so when I see something [[09:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33868.52s)]
*  that's not working, I change it. [[09:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33870.52s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[09:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33872.52s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. [[09:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33874.52s)]
*  And that's [[09:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33878.52s)]
*  exactly [[09:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33880.52s)]
*  what I did as soon as I became [[09:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33882.52s)]
*  Prime Minister. Homes, [[09:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33884.52s)]
*  boy, I don't need to tell you this here, [[09:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33886.52s)]
*  homes have become too [[09:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33888.52s)]
*  expensive. So we are cutting taxes [[09:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33890.52s)]
*  on them, and we have [[09:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33892.52s)]
*  set out a strategy to build [[09:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33894.52s)]
*  twice as many homes. We're going to [[09:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33896.52s)]
*  build half a million homes a year [[09:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33898.52s)]
*  using B.C. technology, [[09:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33900.52s)]
*  B.C. skilled trays, [[09:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33902.52s)]
*  and B.C. lumber. [[09:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33904.52s)]
*  We saw, [[09:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33914.52s)]
*  we saw that the capital [[09:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33916.52s)]
*  gains tax hike, [[09:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33918.52s)]
*  what was that doing? It was stifling [[09:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33920.52s)]
*  builders, the very builders we need. [[09:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33922.52s)]
*  It was holding back innovators. [[09:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33924.52s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[09:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33926.52s)]
*  We saw, [[09:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33928.52s)]
*  you know, across this country, [[09:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33930.52s)]
*  the consumer [[09:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33932.52s)]
*  carbon tax [[09:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33934.52s)]
*  looked good on paper, but it was [[09:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33936.52s)]
*  too divisive, too divisive. [[09:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33938.52s)]
*  So we eliminated it on [[09:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33940.52s)]
*  day one. The B.C. [[09:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=33942.52s)]

*  And we're going to make them. [[09:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34020.52s)]
*  And we have concluded a very important agreement [[09:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34024.52s)]
*  with Australia and [[09:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34026.52s)]

*  as Prime Minister, [[09:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34040.52s)]
*  I brought together all the Premiers [[09:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34042.52s)]
*  and we agreed to eliminate [[09:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34044.52s)]
*  all the barriers on trade [[09:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34046.52s)]

*  our own country. [[09:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34050.52s)]
*  And I went home that night [[09:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34056.52s)]
*  and I thought, [[09:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34058.52s)]
*  when is the last time [[09:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34060.52s)]
*  all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[09:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34062.52s)]
*  Anything? [[09:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34064.52s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, [[09:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34066.52s)]
*  hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. [[09:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34068.52s)]
*  Fair, but if that's what it takes. [[09:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34070.52s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one [[09:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34072.52s)]
*  Canadian economy, not [[09:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34074.52s)]
*  thirteen. And my government will [[09:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34076.52s)]
*  do its best. [[09:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34078.52s)]
*  If you send us [[09:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34082.52s)]
*  to Ottawa, we will eliminate [[09:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34084.52s)]
*  all federal regulations [[09:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34086.52s)]
*  by July 1st. Free trade in [[09:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34088.52s)]
*  Canada by Canada Day. [[09:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34090.52s)]
*  So, in nine days [[09:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34098.52s)]
*  of government, before the election, [[09:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34100.52s)]
*  nine days of government, we did more [[09:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34102.52s)]
*  than Pierre Pauliev [[09:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34104.52s)]
*  has imagined in all of his [[09:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34106.52s)]
*  decades in politics. [[09:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34108.52s)]
*  And that's it. [[09:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34114.52s)]
*  If he had an imagination [[09:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34116.52s)]
*  and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[09:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34118.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[09:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34120.52s)]
*  That's what it looks like [[09:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34122.52s)]
*  to me. That's what it looks like to me. [[09:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34124.52s)]
*  That's what he's doing. [[09:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34126.52s)]
*  And the question is, imagine [[09:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34128.52s)]
*  what we could do together [[09:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34130.52s)]
*  over the next four years [[09:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34132.52s)]
*  if we have a [[09:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34134.52s)]
*  strong mandate. [[09:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34136.52s)]
*  That's what we need. [[09:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34138.52s)]
*  Because [[09:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34142.52s)]
*  we need in this country, we [[09:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34146.52s)]
*  need a strong and positive [[09:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34148.52s)]
*  government. [[09:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34150.52s)]
*  Because, as he [[09:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34152.52s)]
*  made clear once again [[09:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34154.52s)]
*  today in the Oval Office, [[09:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34156.52s)]
*  once again today [[09:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34158.52s)]
*  in the Oval Office, President Trump, [[09:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34160.52s)]
*  he is trying to break [[09:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34162.52s)]
*  us so that America [[09:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34164.52s)]
*  can own us. [[09:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34166.52s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. [[09:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34172.52s)]
*  That's the answer, Donald. [[09:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34174.52s)]
*  That will never happen. [[09:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34176.52s)]
*  Ever. [[09:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34178.52s)]
*  They're going to have to come [[09:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34182.52s)]
*  through Surrey. They're not going to make it. [[09:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34184.52s)]
*  They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[09:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34186.52s)]
*  Turn them back [[09:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34188.52s)]
*  to the border. [[09:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34190.52s)]
*  But you know what? [[09:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34192.52s)]
*  I've realized over the last few weeks across [[09:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34194.52s)]
*  the country, we're over the shock [[09:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34196.52s)]
*  of this betrayal. [[09:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34198.52s)]
*  But at the same time, we should [[09:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34200.52s)]
*  never forget the lessons [[09:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34202.52s)]
*  we've been taught. [[09:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34204.52s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. [[09:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34206.52s)]
*  And we have [[09:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34208.52s)]
*  to take care [[09:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34210.52s)]
*  of each other. [[09:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34212.52s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[09:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34214.52s)]
*  We didn't [[09:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34222.52s)]
*  ask for this fight. [[09:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34224.52s)]
*  But Canada's strong. [[09:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34226.52s)]
*  I'll tell you, [[09:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34228.52s)]
*  Canadians are [[09:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34230.52s)]
*  always ready when someone else [[09:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34232.52s)]
*  drops the gloves. [[09:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34234.52s)]
*  And what the Americans [[09:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34236.52s)]
*  are going to find out [[09:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34238.52s)]

*  be ambitious, and [[09:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34332.52s)]
*  this being Canada, stay humble. [[09:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34334.52s)]
*  Right? [[09:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34336.52s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. [[09:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34338.52s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[09:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34340.52s)]
*  But these are [[09:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34342.52s)]
*  these are [[09:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34344.52s)]
*  these are Surrey values. [[09:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34346.52s)]
*  These are Canadian [[09:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34348.52s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[09:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34350.52s)]
*  I took them with me. [[09:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34352.52s)]
*  And [[09:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34364.52s)]
*  And [[09:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34366.52s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't know that [[09:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34380.52s)]
*  Pierre Poliev gets any of this because... [[09:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34392.24s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. [[09:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34396.74s)]
*  I know, I know. [[09:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34400.939999999995s)]
*  I don't get it either. [[09:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34402.24s)]
*  I don't get it. [[09:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34403.24s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[09:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34404.24s)]
*  I have though seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong [[09:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34408.32s)]
*  politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually [[09:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34415.2s)]
*  worked in the private sector. [[09:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34422.0s)]
*  It's much easier that way. [[09:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34424.08s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[09:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34426.2s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind but relies on his reflex to always [[09:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34430.2s)]
*  cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[09:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34437.399999999994s)]
*  Let's say, let's say so. [[09:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34442.399999999994s)]
*  Yeah. [[09:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34445.2s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[09:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34446.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[09:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34452.799999999996s)]
*  We need, we need calm, not chaos. [[09:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34454.399999999994s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[09:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34458.84s)]
*  Action. [[09:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34461.84s)]
*  Yeah, we need... [[09:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34462.84s)]
*  That's right. [[09:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34463.84s)]
*  That's right. [[09:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34464.84s)]
*  Because negativity will not allow us to win a commercial war. [[09:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34465.84s)]
*  Negativity will not pay the rent or the mortgage. [[09:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34475.84s)]
*  Negativity will not lower the price of the property. [[09:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34480.84s)]
*  And negativity will not make Canada strong. [[09:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34485.84s)]
*  Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries, it's not going to pay the rent, it's not going [[09:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34491.84s)]
*  to win a trade war, it will not make Canada strong. [[09:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34495.84s)]
*  And what we're seeing in the US with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening [[09:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34499.84s)]
*  the Americans. [[09:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34506.03999999999s)]
*  We resist. [[09:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34507.03999999999s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[09:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34509.03999999999s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[09:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34510.799999999996s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger. [[09:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34512.0s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[09:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34514.08s)]
*  That's right. [[09:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34517.08s)]
*  That's right. [[09:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34518.08s)]
*  You know what? [[09:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34519.08s)]
*  When the Americans look, look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength [[09:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34524.08s)]
*  that they want. [[09:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34533.08s)]
*  They want our resources. [[09:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34534.96s)]
*  They want our water. [[09:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34537.64s)]
*  That's right. [[09:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34539.36s)]
*  They want our land. [[09:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34540.520000000004s)]
*  They want our country. [[09:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34541.88s)]
*  They want our country. [[09:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34544.439999999995s)]
*  Never. [[09:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34545.439999999995s)]
*  Never. [[09:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34546.439999999995s)]
*  Never. [[09:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34547.439999999995s)]
*  Never. [[09:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34548.439999999995s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[09:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34549.439999999995s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[09:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34553.759999999995s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[09:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34560.0s)]
*  America. [[09:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34565.0s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[09:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34567.84s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[09:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34570.04s)]
*  Look at the diversity. [[09:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34571.76s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[09:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34572.76s)]
*  Look at this room. [[09:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34573.76s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[09:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34574.76s)]
*  The diversity. [[09:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34575.76s)]
*  Canada is a mosaic. [[09:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34576.76s)]
*  You know, in the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[09:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34581.76s)]
*  In Canada, healthcare is a right. [[09:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34590.240000000005s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. [[09:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34596.76s)]
*  We don't recognize the Indigenous peoples. [[09:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34604.76s)]
*  And there will never be rights for the French language. [[09:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34607.76s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. [[09:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34612.76s)]
*  And Canada will never ever be part of America in any way, shape or form. [[09:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34615.76s)]
*  So, having solved that, so what do we do? [[09:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34624.76s)]
*  So, what do we do now? [[09:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34637.76s)]
*  Fight. [[09:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34639.76s)]
*  Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[09:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34640.76s)]
*  And my experience is in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the [[09:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34644.76s)]
*  best. [[09:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34650.76s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[09:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34652.76s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. [[09:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34657.76s)]
*  So, we need a leader who can stand up to him. [[09:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34663.76s)]
*  We need a leader who can stand up to him. [[09:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34667.76s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[09:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34670.76s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. [[09:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34672.76s)]
*  You're close. [[09:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34674.76s)]
*  You're close. [[09:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34675.76s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. [[09:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34681.76s)]
*  No. [[09:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34686.76s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas [[09:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34688.76s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[09:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34695.76s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats facing [[09:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34706.76s)]
*  Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[09:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34712.76s)]
*  956 days and counting. [[09:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34719.76s)]
*  It took me three weeks. [[09:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34724.76s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth, it wasn't that hard. [[09:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34727.76s)]
*  I don't know. [[09:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34731.76s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[09:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34733.76s)]
*  So, we are in a situation, as usual, we are at home. [[09:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34742.76s)]
*  We can control our economic destiny. [[09:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34749.76s)]
*  We can and we will control our destiny with the right plan. [[09:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34753.76s)]
*  Because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[09:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34760.76s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetime, to succeed [[09:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34767.76s)]
*  in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force. [[09:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34772.76s)]
*  Overwhelming force to overcome the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties [[09:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34777.76s)]
*  we all feel. [[09:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34782.76s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses [[09:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34784.76s)]
*  face, and overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. [[09:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34790.76s)]
*  You know, the private sector in these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. [[09:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34797.76s)]
*  And government, and government needs, government needs, government needs. [[09:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34802.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34814.76s)]
*  Government needs to step up, government needs to step up and provide direction, to catalyze [[09:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34825.76s)]
*  action, and drive investment. [[09:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34833.76s)]
*  And that, that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[09:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34838.76s)]
*  So, what do we do as a plan? [[09:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34850.76s)]
*  How do we do that? [[09:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34853.76s)]
*  We start, we've got to start at home. [[09:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34854.76s)]
*  We've got to start by making, making the government spend less, so that Canadians can invest more. [[09:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34857.76s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[09:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34866.76s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, you guessed it, is to build. [[09:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34874.76s)]
*  Build, baby, build. [[09:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34880.76s)]
*  That is what we're going to do. [[09:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34882.76s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super powerhouse, [[09:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34884.76s)]
*  to create a good career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new [[09:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34891.76s)]
*  reliable partners around the world. [[09:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34901.76s)]
*  Our plan. [[09:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34905.76s)]
*  There was a lot in that. [[09:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34907.76s)]
*  Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, and it will usher in a [[09:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34910.76s)]
*  new era of investment, of jobs and growth. [[09:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34917.76s)]
*  We will create $20,000 in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. [[09:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34921.76s)]
*  That's what we're going to do. [[09:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34930.76s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[09:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34932.76s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their [[09:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34937.76s)]
*  platform yesterday. [[09:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34942.76s)]
*  Yeah, it's a joke, it's a joke. [[09:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34945.76s)]
*  I thought the same thing, actually. [[09:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34947.76s)]
*  Same thing. [[09:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34949.76s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually, and I'm going to read it. [[09:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34951.76s)]
*  I'm going to read it. [[09:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34955.76s)]
*  I thought the same thing, actually. [[09:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34957.76s)]
*  Same thing. [[09:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34959.76s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. [[09:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34961.76s)]
*  Lots of pictures. [[09:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34963.76s)]
*  Lots of pictures of Pierre. [[09:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34965.76s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Paulièvre has no plan to stand [[09:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34967.76s)]
*  up to President Trump. [[09:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34972.76s)]
*  He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. [[09:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34975.76s)]
*  That's very clever. [[09:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34980.76s)]
*  That's very subtle, that. [[09:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34982.76s)]
*  That's the big issue of our day. [[09:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34984.76s)]
*  I know the world's superpowers attacking us, but let's sort out the straw thing first. [[09:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34986.76s)]
*  I'm going to deal with the Americans. [[09:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34993.76s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. [[09:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=34996.76s)]
*  He's ignoring the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy [[09:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35003.76s)]
*  that works for everyone. [[09:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35008.76s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. [[09:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35010.76s)]
*  He wants to cut what Canadians value, childcare, dental care, pharmacare, treatment for mental [[09:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35016.76s)]
*  health and addictions, and the CBC. [[09:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35026.76s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. [[09:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35033.76s)]
*  It won't arrive for four years after President Trump is due to leave office. [[09:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35039.76s)]
*  It's not a solution. [[09:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35048.76s)]
*  Our tax cut shows up July 1, by the way, $825 for hard-working Canadians. [[09:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35050.76s)]
*  Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, you do it right away. [[09:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35058.76s)]
*  Unlike Pierre Paulièvre, I've managed budgets before. [[09:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35062.76s)]
*  I've managed economy. [[09:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35068.76s)]
*  I've managed economies before. [[09:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35070.76s)]
*  And I've managed crises before. [[09:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35072.76s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[09:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35074.76s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. [[09:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35083.76s)]
*  A crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[09:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35091.76s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[09:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35098.76s)]
*  Pierre Paulièvre and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[09:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35112.76s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[09:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35118.76s)]
*  And, you know, to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[09:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35124.76s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[09:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35128.76s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[09:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35139.76s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[09:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35141.76s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down, [[09:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35145.76s)]
*  to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[09:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35149.76s)]
*  No. Anyone? Any takers? No. [[09:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35154.76s)]
*  That is not, that is not what makes Canada strong. [[09:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35158.76s)]
*  I know, we know, we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[09:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35163.76s)]
*  I know, I know, we know. [[09:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35177.76s)]
*  As America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[09:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35180.76s)]
*  And we should. [[09:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35185.76s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[09:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35190.76s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about why I care and why we as liberals, [[09:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35196.76s)]
*  why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[09:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35206.76s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[09:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35211.76s)]
*  It's because we care about people. [[09:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35213.76s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[09:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35217.76s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[09:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35220.76s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[09:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35228.76s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten year old students. [[09:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35231.76s)]
*  And the kids were asked to describe their dreams for Canada. [[09:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35241.76s)]
*  She gave me the papers that they'd written. [[09:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35245.76s)]
*  And some kids wrote about a country free of poverty. [[09:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35248.76s)]
*  Others, yeah, be good, yeah. [[09:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35254.76s)]
*  Others dreamt of clean air and clean water or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity and respect. [[09:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35256.76s)]
*  These kids, these kids like kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[09:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35268.76s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[09:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35277.76s)]
*  But you know what struck me is that many of these cards, the kids wrote about tariffs and threats to our sovereignty. [[09:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35282.76s)]
*  And those are words I had not met at their age. [[09:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35295.76s)]
*  Those are words I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. [[09:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35299.76s)]
*  And I'm going to quote one of them. [[09:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35303.76s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind and a clean Canada. [[09:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35305.76s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[09:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35320.76s)]
*  Watch that state. [[09:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35330.76s)]
*  You know, our children, our children should be able to dream about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[09:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35333.76s)]
*  So, well I know these times are unsettling. [[09:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35343.76s)]
*  I also know that we can give our children that future, the future they deserve. [[09:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35347.76s)]
*  And not because it's easy, not because it will be easy, but because it is right. [[09:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35352.76s)]
*  And that is why I'm standing here before you. [[09:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35363.76s)]
*  Canada has given me everything. [[09:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35376.76s)]
*  My family, my education and my values. [[09:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35380.76s)]
*  And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[09:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35385.76s)]
*  Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. [[09:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35402.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, I know that's dangerous to say. [[09:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35407.76s)]
*  Good luck. [[09:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35411.76s)]
*  Okay, yes, soon, soon. [[09:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35415.76s)]
*  Look, but in seriousness, to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. [[09:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35418.76s)]
*  Because there are only five days left in this campaign. [[09:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35428.76s)]
*  Only five days left in this campaign. [[09:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35432.76s)]
*  And I know a number of you, I can see you, a number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. [[09:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35434.76s)]
*  But to use a hockey analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup final. [[09:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35447.76s)]
*  You know what to do. [[09:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35459.76s)]
*  It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[09:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35461.76s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. [[09:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35464.76s)]
*  It means making more phone calls. [[09:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35467.76s)]
*  It means talking to your friends and families. [[09:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35470.76s)]
*  And it means to vote Liberal. [[09:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35472.76s)]
*  Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. could decide the next Prime Minister. [[09:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35475.76s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[09:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35480.76s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[09:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35485.76s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[09:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35493.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35496.76s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[09:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35498.76s)]
*  All right. [[09:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35515.76s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. [[09:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35531.76s)]
*  Hello, Cloverdale. [[09:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35536.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35538.76s)]
*  Thank you, Diana. [[09:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35540.76s)]
*  Diana, not just for that introduction, but for all of your work on this campaign. [[09:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35541.76s)]
*  Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions. [[09:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35548.76s)]
*  Commitment and compassion, as in everything that she does. [[09:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35558.76s)]
*  Look, it is fantastic. [[09:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35562.76s)]
*  I've been looking forward to this all week. [[09:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35565.76s)]
*  Thank you for everything you're doing. [[09:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35567.76s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[09:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35569.76s)]
*  It is great to be in Canada's fastest growing, most diverse community. [[09:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35571.76s)]
*  And it's great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[09:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35579.76s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. [[09:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35601.76s)]
*  Who's ready? [[09:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35606.76s)]
*  Who is ready? [[09:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35609.76s)]
*  Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[09:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35611.76s)]
*  Who is ready? [[09:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35617.76s)]
*  Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[09:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35624.76s)]
*  Okay. [[09:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35631.76s)]
*  Okay. [[09:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35637.76s)]
*  With this room, I think we got a shot. [[09:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35639.76s)]
*  We got a shot at winning that election. [[09:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35641.76s)]
*  But we need it. [[09:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35643.76s)]
*  Elbows up. [[09:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35645.76s)]
*  And their most steadfast ally. [[09:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35647.76s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. [[09:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35649.76s)]
*  Keep going. [[09:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35651.76s)]
*  This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. [[09:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35653.76s)]
*  It is a tragedy. [[09:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35658.76s)]
*  It is also our new reality. [[09:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35659.76s)]
*  We have to deal with this. [[09:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35661.76s)]
*  And we will get through this crisis. [[09:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35663.76s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[09:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35667.76s)]
*  values. This is time for serious leadership, serious leadership and a united country. We [[09:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35678.76s)]
*  need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. We need to come together. [[09:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35700.200000000004s)]
*  I saw a sign that said this, we need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[09:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35705.12s)]
*  There it is. En français, même en français. Ce bat protéger, bâtir, c'est ça. We need to fight [[09:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35712.08s)]
*  Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[09:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35727.04s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and [[09:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35733.16s)]
*  our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. Pierre Pauli have [[09:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35744.0s)]
*  pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. Above all, in BC and across Canada, [[09:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35754.92s)]
*  we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. Now, that's not necessarily [[09:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35779.920000000006s)]
*  going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes, some big changes, and I'm ready to make [[09:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35791.8s)]
*  them. You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell. I am not a career politician, [[09:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35799.560000000005s)]
*  but I am a pragmatist. And so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[09:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35806.2s)]
*  Something's not working, I change it. And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime [[09:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35814.159999999996s)]
*  Minister. Homes, boy, I don't need to tell you this here in Surrey. Homes have become too expensive, [[09:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35825.2s)]
*  so we are cutting taxes on them and we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. We're [[09:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35831.48s)]
*  going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays, and BC lumber. [[09:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35838.920000000006s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? It was stifling builders, [[09:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35846.24s)]
*  the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. [[09:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35863.24s)]
*  We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, [[09:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35869.76s)]
*  but it was too divisive, too divisive. So we eliminated it on day one. The BC government [[09:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35877.68s)]
*  followed up. Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a [[09:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35885.600000000006s)]
*  liter at the pump. Okay. And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against [[09:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35893.12s)]
*  climate change because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home [[09:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35899.880000000005s)]
*  retrofit. Not your tax dollars, them. We have expanded access to the Canadian health system [[09:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35905.48s)]
*  so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. 5 million more Canadians access to dental care. [[09:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35918.56s)]
*  We have strengthened our commercial relations with the European Union so that our exporters [[09:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35926.56s)]
*  are less dependent on the United States. New relations, EU, less dependent on the US. [[09:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35938.64s)]
*  We are Canada. We've got lots of friends. We got lots of friends. America doesn't want to be our [[09:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35949.36s)]
*  friends. We've got others. And we're going to make them. [[09:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35956.36s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation [[09:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35958.759999999995s)]
*  with France and the United Kingdom. So at the end of my first week as Prime Minister, [[09:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35969.56s)]
*  I brought together all the premiers to Ottawa and we agreed to eliminate all the barriers on trade [[09:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35980.56s)]
*  and workers inside our own country. And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last [[09:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=35989.2s)]
*  time all the premiers agreed on anything? Anything. Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, [[10:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36003.0s)]
*  which is fair. But if that's what it takes. But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, [[10:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36010.84s)]
*  not 13. And my government will do its best. If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all [[10:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36016.84s)]
*  federal regulations by July 1st. Free trade in Canada by Canada Day. So in nine days of government, [[10:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36027.719999999994s)]
*  before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of [[10:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36042.6s)]
*  his decades in politics. And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[10:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36048.84s)]
*  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. [[10:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36062.439999999995s)]
*  That's what he's doing. And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next [[10:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36067.4s)]
*  four years if we have a strong mandate. That's what we need. Because we need in this country, [[10:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36074.52s)]
*  we need a strong and positive government. Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, [[10:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36088.76s)]
*  once again today in the Oval Office, President Trump, he is trying to break us so that America [[10:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36100.200000000004s)]
*  can own us. Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. [[10:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36107.72s)]
*  Never. They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're [[10:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36118.76s)]
*  not going to make it through Surrey. Turn them back to the border. But you know what? [[10:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36127.32s)]
*  I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[10:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36134.76s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. We have to look out [[10:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36141.0s)]
*  for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. That's our responsibility. [[10:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36148.36s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, [[10:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36160.44s)]
*  Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[10:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36171.48s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, [[10:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36176.84s)]
*  just like in hockey, we will win. We will win. [[10:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36184.28s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. I grew up [[10:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36197.0s)]
*  with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[10:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36204.28s)]
*  My parents were teachers. And what they stressed was what my, I'm talking about my parents. [[10:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36209.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36223.4s)]
*  Thank you. You know, the lessons, they stress the importance. They stress the importance. [[10:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36232.04s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard, the importance of supporting our community, [[10:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36252.840000000004s)]
*  the importance of caring for other people. Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[10:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36260.76s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, [[10:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36265.560000000005s)]
*  get off the ice quickly, be ambitious, and this being Canada, stay humble. Right? They don't teach [[10:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36271.72s)]
*  you to stay humble in the U.S. They teach you to stay humble in Canada. But these are, [[10:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36278.92s)]
*  these are Surrey values. These are Canadian values. And I took them with me. I took them with me. [[10:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36285.96s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, I don't [[10:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36308.92s)]
*  know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. Because, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut. I know, [[10:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36332.36s)]
*  I know. I don't get it either. I don't get it. He doesn't get it. [[10:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36342.2s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world because there is a type of lifelong [[10:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36348.76s)]
*  politician who worships at the altar of the free market despite never having actually worked [[10:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36355.64s)]
*  in the private sector. Much easier that way. And it's a kind of, [[10:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36363.08s)]
*  it's a kind of politician who never changes his mind, but relies on his reflex to always cut, [[10:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36370.44s)]
*  to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. And they say, they say so. Yeah. Now, what we need [[10:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36378.84s)]
*  more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. Yeah. We need, we need calm, not chaos. And we [[10:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36389.159999999996s)]
*  need action, not anger. Action. Yeah, we need that. That's right. [[10:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36399.56s)]
*  Don't look Canada full. Negativity isn't going to pay the groceries. It's not going to pay the rent. [[10:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36430.36s)]
*  It's not going to win a trade war. It will not make Canada strong. And what we're seeing in the [[10:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36435.399999999994s)]
*  U.S. with this politics, it is already dividing and weakening the Americans. We resist. We will [[10:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36441.32s)]
*  win this battle. We will win this battle. They will get weaker. We will get stronger. We will [[10:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36450.04s)]
*  win this battle if we are strong and united. You know what? When the Americans look, [[10:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36454.76s)]
*  look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. They want our resources. [[10:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36469.96s)]
*  They want our water. That's right. They want our land. They want our country. They want our [[10:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36476.84s)]
*  country. Never, never, never, never, never for many reasons. But most fundamentally, because Canada [[10:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36485.399999999994s)]
*  is not America. Canada is not America. America. [[10:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36497.8s)]
*  America is a melting pot. Canada, look at this room. Look at the diversity. We're all [[10:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36507.64s)]
*  Canadians. Look at this room. We're all Canadians. The diversity. Canada is a mosaic. [[10:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36513.4s)]
*  You know, in the United States, health care is a big business. In Canada, health care is a right. [[10:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36519.4s)]
*  In the United States, we don't recognize differences. We don't recognize [[10:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36534.44s)]
*  Indigenous peoples. And there will never be rights for the French language. [[10:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36547.0s)]
*  The United States is not Canada. And Canada will never, ever be part of America. [[10:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36553.880000000005s)]
*  In any way, shape or form. So, having solved that, [[10:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36562.84s)]
*  what do we do? So what do we do now? Fight. Now, first we have to manage through this crisis. [[10:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36577.24s)]
*  And my experience is, in a crisis, you have to prepare for the worst, not hope for the best. [[10:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36585.079999999994s)]
*  You have to distinguish between what you can change and what you can't. [[10:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36593.32s)]
*  And I think after 78 years, we can't change President Trump. So we need a leader who can [[10:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36598.52s)]
*  stand up to him. We need a leader who can stand up to him. I've got someone in mind. [[10:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36606.52s)]
*  I've got someone in mind. You're close. You're close. [[10:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36613.079999999994s)]
*  That leader, that leader is not, it's not Pierre Polyev. No. [[10:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36622.84s)]
*  It's not Pierre Polyev who draws his inspiration from President Trump, who copies his ideas, [[10:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36630.119999999995s)]
*  and whose first instinct when our nation was attacked was to call Canada stupid. [[10:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36636.439999999995s)]
*  That's not Pierre Polyev who chooses to be willfully blind to the growing threats [[10:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36643.24s)]
*  facing Canada by refusing, for some reason, to get his security clearance. [[10:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36653.079999999994s)]
*  956 days and counting. It took me, it took me, it took me three weeks. [[10:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36661.079999999994s)]
*  Had to fill out a couple forms, tell the truth. Wasn't that hard? I don't know. [[10:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36668.36s)]
*  Seems straight up, straight up to me. [[10:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36674.44s)]
*  At all, nous sommes, nous sommes dans une situation, comme d'habitude, nous sommes [[10:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36683.48s)]
*  mette chez nous. Nous pouvons contrôler notre destin économique. We can and we will control [[10:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36689.0s)]
*  our destiny with the right plan. Because, because in a crisis, in a crisis, plan beats no plan. [[10:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36697.96s)]
*  And to succeed in a crisis, and we are in the gravest crisis of our lifetimes, [[10:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36708.12s)]
*  to succeed in a crisis, you have to act with overwhelming force, overwhelming force to overcome [[10:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36712.84s)]
*  the anxieties that people naturally feel, the anxieties we all feel. [[10:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36720.6s)]
*  We have to act with overwhelming force to break through the uncertainty that businesses face, [[10:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36725.56s)]
*  and overwhelming force to replace what the crisis is taking away. You know, the private sector in [[10:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36732.439999999995s)]
*  these situations pulls back, it starts to retreat. And government, and government needs, government [[10:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36739.88s)]
*  needs, government needs, government needs to step up, government needs to step [[10:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36748.28s)]
*  up and provide direction, to catalyze action, and drive investment. And that, [[10:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36770.04s)]
*  that is what our plan, that is what our plan for Canada Strong will do. [[10:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36782.52s)]
*  So what do we do as a plan? How do we do that? We start, we got to start at home. [[10:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36791.719999999994s)]
*  We've got to start by making, making the government spend less so that Canadians can invest more. [[10:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36798.6s)]
*  We have to cut out, and we will cut out government waste. [[10:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36808.68s)]
*  But the core of our plan, the core of our plan, [[10:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36815.159999999996s)]
*  you guessed it, is to build. Build, baby, build. That is what we're going to do. [[10:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36819.4s)]
*  Our plan will allow us to build millions of homes, to make Canada a super-powerful energy, [[10:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36828.76s)]
*  to create a good career in specialized jobs, to build new commercial corridors with new reliable partners around the world. [[10:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36840.36s)]
*  Our plan, there was a lot in that. Our plan will fight back against President Trump's trade war, [[10:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36852.520000000004s)]
*  and it will usher in a new era of investment, of jobs and growth. We will create $20,000 [[10:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36863.560000000005s)]
*  in new growth for every single Canadian over the next five years. That's what we mean. [[10:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36871.72s)]
*  That's what we mean when we say we're making Canada strong together. [[10:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36879.64s)]
*  Now I'm going to do a little comparison, because the Conservatives finally released their platform [[10:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36886.840000000004s)]
*  yesterday. Yeah, it's a joke, it's a joke. I thought the same thing, actually, same thing. [[10:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36893.88s)]
*  It didn't take me long to read it, actually. Lots of pictures, lots of pictures of Pierre. [[10:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36901.32s)]
*  And really what it demonstrated, that once again Pierre Pauliev has no plan to stand up [[10:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36907.079999999994s)]
*  to President Trump. He is literally grasping at straws as Canada. That's very clever. [[10:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36914.03999999999s)]
*  Very subtle that. That's the big issue of our day. I know the world's superpowers attacking us, [[10:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36922.52s)]
*  but let's sort out the straw thing first and deal with the Americans. [[10:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36931.56s)]
*  He's offering Canadians a fantasy of fiscal tricks and phantom growth. He's ignoring [[10:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36937.88s)]
*  the investments that we need to build the strongest economy, an economy that works for everyone. [[10:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36945.96s)]
*  He's surrendering, literally surrendering in the fight against climate change. He wants to cut, [[10:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36951.56s)]
*  he wants to cut what Canadians value. Child care, dental care, [[10:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36959.32s)]
*  pharmacare, treatment for mental health and addictions and the CBC. [[10:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36965.48s)]
*  He has a bring it home tax cut that is never home. It won't arrive for four years [[10:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36974.12s)]
*  after President Trump is due to leave office. It's not a solution. Our tax cut shows up July 1, [[10:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36984.12s)]
*  by the way, $825 for hard-working Canadians. Because if you're a pragmatist, you do something, [[10:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=36992.12s)]
*  you do it right away. Unlike Pierre Pauliev, I've managed budgets before. [[10:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37001.16s)]
*  I've managed economies before and I've managed crises before. [[10:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37006.92s)]
*  And I know that in a crisis, you build forward, you don't cut back. [[10:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37011.96s)]
*  A crisis is a time for bold action, not tired ideology. A crisis is a time to come together, [[10:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37021.32s)]
*  a crisis is a time to come together, not to sow division. [[10:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37032.92s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience, not experiments. [[10:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37043.0s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada, and he has some allies in Canada, [[10:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37053.079999999994s)]
*  they don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. And, you know, to be charitable, [[10:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37060.12s)]
*  maybe they believe what they're saying. Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves [[10:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37066.600000000006s)]
*  is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. It's possible, they could believe it. Maybe they [[10:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37073.64000000001s)]
*  believe that we should just go along to get along. That the way to get through this crisis is to keep [[10:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37083.16s)]
*  our heads down, to give the Americans what they want and hope for the best. [[10:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37089.0s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? No. That is not what makes Canada strong. I know, we know, [[10:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37097.48s)]
*  we can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[10:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37106.200000000004s)]
*  And I know, I know, we know, as America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[10:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37111.16s)]
*  The choice, I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. Now, [[10:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37131.560000000005s)]
*  I talk a lot about a strong economy, and before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about [[10:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37138.44s)]
*  why I care and why we as Liberals, why we as Canadians care about building a strong economy. [[10:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37144.04s)]
*  And it goes back to community. It's because we care about people. That value of community [[10:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37151.4s)]
*  that we all share. We know we are all in this together. [[10:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37158.600000000006s)]
*  And I want to give an example. From a few weeks ago, I met a teacher in Ontario who told me about [[10:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37168.12s)]
*  a routine assignment that she'd given to her nine and ten-year-old students. And the kids were asked [[10:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37176.840000000004s)]
*  to describe their dreams for Canada. She gave me the papers that they'd written. And some kids [[10:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37183.880000000005s)]
*  wrote about a country free of poverty. Others, yeah, be good, yeah. Others dreamt of clean air [[10:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37190.52s)]
*  and clean water, or a place where everyone enjoyed equal rights, dignity, and respect. [[10:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37199.88s)]
*  These kids, these kids, like the kids here, kids there, well brought up, well taught. [[10:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37209.96s)]
*  Because what they're expressing is what we all want for ourselves, what we all want for each other. [[10:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37218.6s)]
*  But you know what struck me? Is that many of these cards the kids wrote about tariffs [[10:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37224.04s)]
*  and threats to our sovereignty. And those are words I had not met at their age. Those are words [[10:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37233.72s)]
*  I did not know when I was nine and ten years old. And I'm going to quote one of them. [[10:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37241.240000000005s)]
*  I dream of a safe, a kind, and a clean Canada. [[10:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37249.560000000005s)]
*  And then the child goes on, goes on and says, a Canada that is not the United States. [[10:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37261.240000000005s)]
*  And what's that? What's that state? You know, our children, our children should be able to dream [[10:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37271.240000000005s)]
*  about a positive future, not worry about an economic crisis. [[10:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37280.36s)]
*  So, well, I know these times are unsettling. I also know that we can give our children that [[10:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37285.0s)]
*  future the future they deserve. And not because it's easy, not because it'll be easy, but because [[10:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37291.8s)]
*  it is right. And that is why I'm standing here before you. Canada has given me everything. [[10:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37302.36s)]
*  My family, my education, and my values. And in return, I'm ready to give my everything to Canada. [[10:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37322.600000000006s)]
*  Wow. Sorry, I teared up a bit because I saw an Euler's sweater up there. I'm sorry. I know [[10:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37341.240000000005s)]
*  it's dangerous to say. Good luck. Yeah, it's not. Okay, yes, soon, soon. Look, but in seriousness, [[10:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37350.84s)]
*  to do everything, to give everything, to deliver this plan, I need your help. Because there are [[10:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37363.719999999994s)]
*  only five days left in this campaign. Only five days left in this campaign. And I know a number [[10:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37370.6s)]
*  of you can see you. A number of you have already given so much of your time and talents to build [[10:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37377.16s)]
*  a better Surrey, a better Cloverdale, and to fight for our country's future. But to use a hockey [[10:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37383.48s)]
*  analogy, there are five minutes left in the third period of game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals. [[10:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37391.240000000005s)]
*  You know what to do. It is time to leave everything on the ice. [[10:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37401.240000000005s)]
*  That means knocking on more doors. It means making more phone calls. It means talking to your friends [[10:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37405.64s)]
*  and families. And it means to vote Liberal. Because the people of Surrey, the people of D.C. [[10:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37411.64s)]
*  could decide the next Prime Minister. I'm asking for your vote to protect the values that we share. [[10:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37418.92s)]
*  I'm asking for your vote to stand up to Donald Trump, to build a united Canada that works for all. [[10:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37427.0s)]
*  Let's build Canada strong. [[10:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37433.96s)]
*  All right. [[10:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37463.96s)]
*  Hello, Surrey. Hello, Cloverdale. Thank you. Thank you, Diana, not just for that introduction, [[10:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37475.32s)]
*  but for all of your work on this campaign. Diana's been out hammering in signs, knocking on doors, [[10:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37485.32s)]
*  making phone calls, trying to find something nice to say about me as introductions, commitment and [[10:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37492.44s)]
*  compassion as in everything that she does. Look, it is fantastic. I've been looking forward to this [[10:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37499.72s)]
*  all week. Thank you for everything you're doing. Thanks for having me. It is great to be in Canada's [[10:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37506.520000000004s)]
*  fastest growing, most diverse community. [[10:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37516.2s)]
*  It is great to be here with a slate of amazing Liberal candidates that we need in Ottawa to build Canada strong. [[10:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37526.44s)]
*  So, look, I have a question. Who's ready? Who is ready? Who is ready to stand up for Canada with me? [[10:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37536.92s)]
*  Who is ready? Who is ready to help the Liberal Party win the most consequential election of our lifetimes? [[10:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37558.12s)]
*  Okay, with this room, I think we got a shot. We got a shot at winning that election. [[10:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37577.64s)]
*  But we need it. Elbows up. And their most steadfast ally. [[10:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37583.24s)]
*  Boo indeed, exactly. Keep going. This, you know, it's actually, it is, this is a tragedy. It is a tragedy. [[10:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37589.0s)]
*  But it's also our new reality. We have to deal with this. And we will get through this crisis. [[10:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37599.479999999996s)]
*  We will get through this crisis if we come together, if we unite around a bold plan rooted in our shared values. [[10:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37608.36s)]
*  This, yeah, this, this, this is time for serious leadership, serious leadership and a united country. [[10:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37619.560000000005s)]
*  We need to come together. We need to come together, but we need to act. We need to come together. [[10:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37640.68s)]
*  And I saw a sign that said this, we need to come together to fight, to protect and to build Canada. [[10:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37645.64s)]
*  There it is. [[10:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37657.64s)]
*  We need to fight Trump's tariffs with counter tariffs of our own that will cause maximum damage in the United States. [[10:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37666.6s)]
*  They asked for it. They're getting it. We need to protect. We need to protect our workers and our businesses using every single dollar of those tariffs. Every single dollar. [[10:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37676.2s)]
*  Pierre Polly have pocketed all the money. We're going to send it to our workers. [[10:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37694.84s)]
*  And above all, [[10:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37700.92s)]
*  above all, in BC and across Canada, we need to unite to build Canada strong. That's what we're going to do. [[10:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37705.64s)]
*  Now, that's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to require some big changes, some big changes, and I'm ready to make them. [[10:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37725.72s)]
*  You know, I'm not a career politician. You can probably tell I am not a career politician, but I am a pragmatist. [[10:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37741.399999999994s)]
*  And so, and so when I see something that's not working, I change it. [[10:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37750.520000000004s)]
*  And that's exactly what I did as soon as I became Prime Minister. [[10:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37760.840000000004s)]
*  Homes, oh, I don't need to tell you this here and sorry, homes have become too expensive. So we are cutting taxes on them. [[10:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37767.16s)]
*  And we have set out a strategy to build twice as many homes. We're going to build half a million homes a year using BC technology, BC skilled trays and BC lumber. [[10:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37774.84s)]
*  We saw that the capital gains tax hike, what was that doing? It was stifling builders, the very builders we need. It was holding back innovators. [[10:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37786.92s)]
*  So we got rid of it. We got rid of it. We saw, you know, across this country, the consumer carbon tax looked good on paper, but it was too divisive, too divisive. [[10:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37807.64s)]
*  So we eliminated it on day one. The BC government followed up. [[10:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37821.8s)]
*  Premier Eby and the BC government followed up, saving you at least 18 cents a litre at the pump. [[10:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37829.48s)]
*  And what we're going to do doesn't mean we're stopping fight against climate change because we're going to get the big polluters to pay you to save energy through home retrofit and energy to clean up. [[10:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37837.32s)]
*  Not your tax dollars, them. [[10:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37849.64s)]
*  We have expanded access to the Canadian health system so that 5 million more Canadians can benefit. [[10:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37852.28s)]
*  5 million more Canadians access dental care. [[10:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37863.32s)]
*  We have strengthened our trade relations with the European Union so that our exporters are less dependent on the United States. [[10:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37867.32s)]
*  We've got others. And we're going to make them. [[10:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37897.32s)]
*  And we have concluded an important agreement with Australia and strengthened our military cooperation with France and the United Kingdom. [[10:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37899.8s)]
*  And I went home that night and I thought, when is the last time all the Premiers agreed on anything? [[10:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37930.280000000006s)]
*  Anything. [[10:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37946.76s)]
*  Except, you know, mutual loathing, hatred of Ottawa, which is fair. But if that's what it takes. [[10:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37948.76s)]
*  But the fact is, we need one Canadian economy, not 13. And my government will do its bit. [[10:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37954.76s)]
*  If you send us to Ottawa, we will eliminate all federal regulations by July 1st, free trade in Canada by Canada Day. [[10:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37964.76s)]
*  So in nine days of government, before the election, nine days of government, we did more than Pierre Pauliev has imagined in all of his decades in politics. [[10:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37976.76s)]
*  And that's it. If he had an imagination and didn't just mimic President Trump. [[10:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=37993.240000000005s)]
*  I'm sorry. That's what it looks like to me. That's what it looks like to me. That's what he's doing. [[10:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38003.240000000005s)]
*  And the question is, imagine what we could do together over the next four years if we have a strong mandate. [[10:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38009.240000000005s)]
*  That's what we need. [[10:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38019.72s)]
*  Because we need in this country, we need a strong and positive government. [[10:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38023.72s)]
*  Because as he made clear once again today in the Oval Office, once again today in the Oval Office, [[10:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38033.72s)]
*  he is trying to break us so that America can own us. [[10:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38044.200000000004s)]
*  Yeah, that's the answer. That's the answer, Donald. That will never happen. Ever. [[10:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38054.200000000004s)]
*  They're going to have to come through Surrey. They're not going to make it. They're not going to make it through Surrey. [[10:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38064.200000000004s)]
*  Turn him back to the border. [[10:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38070.68s)]
*  But you know what? I've realized over the last few weeks across the country, we're over the shock of this betrayal. [[10:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38072.68s)]
*  But at the same time, we should never forget the lessons we've been taught. [[10:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38080.68s)]
*  We have to look out for ourselves. And we have to take care of each other. [[10:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38086.68s)]
*  That's our responsibility. [[10:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38094.68s)]
*  You know, we didn't ask for this fight. [[10:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38100.68s)]
*  But Canada is strong. I'll tell you, Canadians are always ready when someone else drops the gloves. [[10:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38106.68s)]
*  And what the Americans, what they're going to find out is in this trade war, just like in hockey, we will win. [[10:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38116.68s)]
*  We will win. [[10:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38130.68s)]
*  Like many of you, like many of you, I grew up, hockey played a big part of my life. [[10:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38136.68s)]
*  I grew up with the values I learned at the kitchen table, in the classroom, and on the ice. [[10:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38144.68s)]
*  My parents were teachers. [[10:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38150.68s)]
*  And what they stressed was... [[10:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38152.68s)]
*  I'm talking about my parents. [[10:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38157.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38163.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38167.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38171.16s)]
*  You know, the lessons. [[10:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38173.16s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[10:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38177.16s)]
*  They stress the importance. [[10:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38181.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38183.16s)]

*  Thank you. [[10:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38191.16s)]
*  You know, the importance of working hard. [[10:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38193.16s)]
*  The importance of supporting our community. [[10:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38197.16s)]
*  The importance of caring for other people. [[10:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38201.16s)]
*  Those were the lessons my parents taught me. [[10:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38203.16s)]
*  My coaches, not surprisingly in the minus 30 in Edmonton, they taught me to play hard, get off the ice quickly, be ambitious. [[10:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38205.16s)]
*  And this being Canada, stay humble. [[10:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38215.64000000001s)]
*  Right? [[10:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38217.64000000001s)]
*  They don't teach you to stay humble in the U.S. [[10:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38219.64000000001s)]
*  They teach you to stay humble in Canada. [[10:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38221.64000000001s)]
*  But these are... [[10:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38223.64000000001s)]
*  These are... [[10:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38225.64000000001s)]
*  These are Surrey values. [[10:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38227.64000000001s)]
*  These are Canadian values. [[10:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38229.64000000001s)]
*  And I took them with me. [[10:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38231.64000000001s)]
*  I took them with me. [[10:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38233.64000000001s)]
*  I relied on these values when I had crises in Canada and abroad. [[10:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38235.64000000001s)]
*  And today... [[10:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38242.12s)]
*  And today I rely on these values to face President Trump and build a renewed economy where everyone can succeed in a world that has been profoundly transformed. [[10:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38244.12s)]
*  Now, this bringing together of community values, this relying on the values, [[10:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38264.12s)]
*  I don't know that Pierre Poliev gets any of this. [[10:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38270.600000000006s)]
*  Because... [[10:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38276.600000000006s)]
*  Cut, cut, cut. [[10:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38278.600000000006s)]
*  I know. [[10:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38280.600000000006s)]
*  I know. [[10:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38282.600000000006s)]
*  I don't get it either. [[10:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38284.600000000006s)]
*  He doesn't get it. [[10:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38286.600000000006s)]
*  I have, though, seen this movie before around the world. [[10:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38288.600000000006s)]
*  Because there is a type of lifelong politician who worships at the altar of the free market and the free market. [[10:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38292.600000000006s)]
*  Despite never having actually worked in the private sector. [[10:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38300.600000000006s)]
*  Much easier that way. [[10:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38304.600000000006s)]
*  And it's a kind of... [[10:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38306.600000000006s)]
*  It's a kind of politician who never changes his mind. [[10:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38310.600000000006s)]
*  But relies on his reflex to always cut, to cut, to cut, to destroy and divide. [[10:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38314.600000000006s)]
*  And I say... [[10:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38322.600000000006s)]
*  I say so. [[10:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38324.600000000006s)]
*  Now, what we need more than ever, we need solutions, not slogans. [[10:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38327.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[10:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38333.08s)]
*  We need... [[10:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38335.08s)]
*  We need calm, not chaos. [[10:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38337.08s)]
*  And we need action, not anger. [[10:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38339.08s)]
*  Action... [[10:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38343.08s)]
*  That's right. [[10:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38345.08s)]
*  That's right. [[10:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38347.08s)]
*  Because... [[10:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38349.08s)]
*  Because negativity won't allow us to win a commercial war. [[10:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38351.08s)]
*  Negativity won't pay the rent or the mortgage. [[10:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38357.08s)]
*  Negativity won't lower the price of the stock. [[10:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38361.08s)]
*  And negativity won't make Canada strong. [[10:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38367.08s)]
*  We will win this battle. [[10:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38387.08s)]
*  They will get weaker, we will get stronger. [[10:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38393.08s)]
*  We will win this battle if we are strong and united. [[10:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38395.08s)]
*  You know what? [[10:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38405.08s)]
*  When the Americans look to Canada, look to British Columbia, it's our strength that they want. [[10:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38407.08s)]
*  They want our resources. [[10:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38415.560000000005s)]
*  They want our water. [[10:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38417.560000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[10:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38419.560000000005s)]
*  They want our land. [[10:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38421.560000000005s)]

*  They want our country. [[10:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38425.560000000005s)]
*  Never. [[10:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38427.560000000005s)]
*  Never. [[10:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38429.560000000005s)]
*  Never for many reasons. [[10:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38431.560000000005s)]
*  But most fundamentally because Canada is not America. [[10:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38433.560000000005s)]
*  Canada is not America. [[10:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38439.560000000005s)]
*  America. [[10:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38441.560000000005s)]
*  America is a melting pot. [[10:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38444.04s)]
*  Canada, look at this room. [[10:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38448.04s)]
*  Look at the diversity. [[10:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38450.04s)]
*  We're all Canadians. [[10:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38452.04s)]

*  The diversity. [[10:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38458.04s)]

*  You know... [[10:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38462.04s)]
*  In the United States, healthcare is a big business. [[10:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38464.04s)]

*  So... [[10:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38507.0s)]
*  Having solved that... [[10:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38509.0s)]

*  So what do we do now? [[10:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38513.0s)]
*  Fight. [[10:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38515.0s)]
*  Now... [[10:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38517.0s)]
*  First, we have to manage through this crisis. [[10:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38519.0s)]

*  Not to sow division. [[10:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38975.72s)]
*  A crisis is a time for experience. [[10:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38981.72s)]
*  Not experiments. [[10:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38983.72s)]
*  Pierre Pauliev and Mr. Trump's allies here in Canada. [[10:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38985.72s)]
*  And he has some allies in Canada. [[10:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38987.72s)]
*  They don't like our plan to stand up to President Trump. [[10:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38989.72s)]
*  We have to stand up to President Trump. [[10:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38995.72s)]
*  And we have to stand up to the president of Canada. [[10:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38997.72s)]
*  And we have to stand up to the president of Canada. [[10:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=38999.72s)]
*  And we have to stand up to the president of Canada. [[10:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39001.72s)]
*  And we have to stand up to President Trump. [[10:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39004.200000000004s)]
*  And to be charitable, maybe they believe what they're saying. [[10:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39006.200000000004s)]
*  Maybe they believe that the best way to defend ourselves is to leave every Canadian to fend for themselves. [[10:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39010.200000000004s)]
*  It's possible. They could believe it. [[10:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39022.200000000004s)]
*  Maybe they believe that we should just go along to get along. [[10:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39024.200000000004s)]
*  That the way to get through this crisis is to keep our heads down. [[10:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39028.200000000004s)]
*  To give the Americans what they want. [[10:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39030.200000000004s)]
*  And hope for the best. [[10:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39032.68s)]
*  Anyone? Any takers? [[10:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39038.68s)]
*  No. That is not. [[10:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39040.68s)]
*  That is not what makes Canada strong. [[10:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39042.68s)]
*  I know. We know. [[10:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39044.68s)]
*  We can give ourselves far more than the Americans can ever take away. [[10:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39046.68s)]
*  I know. [[10:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39058.68s)]
*  We know. We know. [[10:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39061.16s)]
*  As America retreats from the world, Canada can lead it. [[10:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39063.16s)]
*  And we should. [[10:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39067.16s)]
*  The choice. [[10:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39071.16s)]
*  I think the choice in this election could not be clearer. [[10:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39075.16s)]
*  Now, I talk a lot about a strong economy. [[10:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39081.16s)]
*  And before I wrap up, I want to say a few words about [[10:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39083.16s)]
*  why I care and why we as liberals, [[10:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39085.16s)]
*  why we as Canadians [[10:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39087.16s)]
*  care about building a strong economy. [[10:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39089.64000000001s)]
*  And it goes back to community. [[10:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39091.64000000001s)]
*  It's because we care about people. [[10:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39095.64000000001s)]
*  That value of community that we all share. [[10:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39099.64000000001s)]
*  We know we are all in this together. [[10:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39101.64000000001s)]
*  And I want to give an example. [[10:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39109.64000000001s)]
*  From a few weeks ago, [[10:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7k2XbselOw&t=39111.64000000001s)]
