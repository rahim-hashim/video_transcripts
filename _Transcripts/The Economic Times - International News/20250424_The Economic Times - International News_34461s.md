# Live | IMF role tokenisation, financial systems: Nandan Nilekani on 'adapting to the new landscape'
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM)
*  you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=0.0s)]
*  many new developments and we can we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31.0s)]
*  We also observed that the Europeans in Europe banks are pretty active on this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=38.0s)]
*  on this field in this space. From our contact with the market we see that 60 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  percent of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT and actually [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=50.04s)]
*  something like 22 percent of them are already have already put in place some [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=55.36s)]
*  sort of application implementing DLT. Also on the security sides we have seen [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=62.76s)]
*  a growing interest in issuing that. We have also the European level of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=70.72s)]
*  specific legislation that allows that so this might have you know improved the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=76.24s)]
*  conditions so that bank venture more easily to this. So confronted with this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=84.64s)]
*  scenario the ECB we think that we need to be in this space very early on for two [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=94.08s)]
*  fundamental reasons. The one reason is the fact that if we are not there with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=99.6s)]
*  central bank money somebody else will be there. We don't have anything against [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=103.92s)]
*  you know commercial bank money but certainly we have to recognize that we [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=108.4s)]
*  run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk which is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=113.6s)]
*  nearant into commercial bank money so that we need we need to be there [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=118.08s)]
*  immediately as a central bank money. And the second reason is that market is [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=122.96s)]
*  asking us to be there. From our contact with the market we we are encouraged to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  offer central bank money because market participants say that this is essential [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=133.32s)]
*  for the market to to develop. So with this with this situation in mind last [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=138.92s)]
*  year from May to September well from November we launched we launched an [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=145.83999999999997s)]
*  experiment work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  experiment and transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  money. The concept with you that we explore was this concept of [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=168.6s)]
*  synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=172.56s)]
*  services which is our traditional system. The three central bank of the euro [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=182.84s)]
*  system they invented a very interesting solution so that you know you could [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=189.12s)]
*  coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank money in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=195.04s)]
*  the RTGS basically. The experiment have been a big success we are we had more [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=199.76s)]
*  than 60 participants exploring many use cases big issuance so our growing [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=206.16s)]
*  interest more than what we were expecting. So the question is what do we [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=212.35999999999999s)]
*  do from there? So we want to continue and get into production move from the [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise soon a [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=221.76s)]
*  solution in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=227.32s)]
*  to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central bank [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=232.67999999999998s)]
*  money. Again we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT on the same on [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=238.23999999999998s)]
*  the same DLT where the assets are. This is for the short term. However we are [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=244.23999999999998s)]
*  also thinking about what to do in the long term in that and here we are open [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=249.56s)]
*  to a much more possible integrated solution where we we can have a you know [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  a unified ledger where we could you could have on the same platform the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  central bank money, commercial bank money assets. You know BIS has been very vocal [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. An alternative [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=270.52s)]
*  possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=274.72s)]
*  which could take care of you know with special life of different use case or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  adapt to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=286.16s)]
*  traditional RTGS to this new to this new solution. So the news is stay tuned. More [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=294.48s)]
*  to come. Great. Thanks so much Piero and let me just interject a little bit of a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=301.6s)]
*  side note on vocabulary. So when when our panelists talk about tokenization [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=309.24s)]
*  distributed ledger or blockchain these are fairly interchangeable to a first [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=315.56s)]
*  order approximation. So you know it is there are some minor differences but you [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=321.76000000000005s)]
*  know DLT tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. So [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=330.52s)]
*  Augustine the BIS the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=336.03999999999996s)]
*  been very active through its innovation hub in particular but also its other [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=342.32s)]
*  activities at the at the BIS in terms of working with central banks to you know [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=349.28s)]
*  explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=357.12s)]
*  world and you have been particularly working on tokenization you know with [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=362.84000000000003s)]
*  central bank but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. So where [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=367.56s)]
*  are you you know having done this for a number of years now where is your [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=373.8s)]
*  thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=377.88s)]
*  so like the future of tokenization and finance. Well thank you thank you very [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=383.16s)]
*  much Tobias it's great to be in this panel. We do very distinguished central [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=390.6s)]
*  bankers Michel Piero and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur thought leader [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=395.24s)]
*  Nandan who knows how to make things to become reality and I think that's why it's [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  great to have somebody like Nandan here with us and of course I would say to [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=408.88s)]
*  Tobias he's an honorary member of the central banking community because he [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=412.96s)]
*  makes always very strong contributions in that respect. Now tokenization first [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=417.44s)]
*  is great that it has become a topic under which we can have a discussion [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=425.88s)]
*  like this. And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=431.47999999999996s)]
*  transactions. I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=436.96s)]
*  financial transactions and the financial systems in general. I would say at least [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=445.4s)]
*  in two directions they can make very important contribution. First it certainly [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=451.71999999999997s)]
*  can improve the way the financial system works today. The most where more [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=457.64s)]
*  most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=464.04s)]
*  payments and well obviously currencies but those are the most elementary type [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=469.2s)]
*  of transactions. Now today if you see how a payment is done what goes behind the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=474.56s)]
*  scenes is tremendously complex tremendously cumbersome and it [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=480.44s)]
*  certainly would behoove us to make them far simpler and that's something that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=487.44s)]
*  tokenization can achieve. Today for example when you do a payment usually [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=492.84s)]
*  there is a separation between messaging reconciliation and settlement given that [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=498.88s)]
*  separation many mistakes can be made controls can be lost especially on KYC [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=503.71999999999997s)]
*  AML CFD. If you integrate everything the efficiency of the system is quite assured [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=510.23999999999995s)]
*  and this can be applied not only for payments but for many other financial [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=518.92s)]
*  transactions. In that sense tokenization also allows something that we can call [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  programmability which is to put everything all the instructions all the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=530.76s)]
*  procedures regulation and so on in a contained chip I would say that [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=538.9599999999999s)]
*  would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=548.24s)]
*  we many of them for example we don't do today. I mean traditionally if you have a [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=553.08s)]
*  discussion among economists many contingent the development of contingent [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=560.24s)]
*  assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=566.88s)]
*  don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. Tokenization [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=572.24s)]
*  definitely could facilitate this and therefore tokenization can really be the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=577.6s)]
*  future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=584.28s)]
*  imagine. Another very attractive aspect of the tokenization and of [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=589.5600000000001s)]
*  technological development is the fact that it would allow many countries to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=595.44s)]
*  leapfrog from where they are today. India for example is a great example and [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=603.52s)]
*  through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen which is the [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=610.48s)]
*  identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  unmistakable way. Really what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=622.84s)]
*  very unsophisticated to something where you really can achieve the financial [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=629.96s)]
*  system contribute to the well-being of the different nations. The contribution [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=635.64s)]
*  of this for inclusion is very very significant and that's why we are [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=642.4s)]
*  supporting this fully at the PIS. Now one can ask us make the following [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=649.96s)]
*  question why the take off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization and I [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=656.96s)]
*  think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts but those [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=663.84s)]
*  efforts are isolated. We have not been fully been able to fully come with a [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=671.1600000000001s)]
*  vision of how can we integrate that. We have tried it through the internet here [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=678.36s)]
*  Nanda will speak later I also will speak later about it. I really welcome what [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=683.8s)]
*  Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCV you're trying to [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=689.3199999999999s)]
*  integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets and to have [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=695.16s)]
*  a joint vision to promote this. If we have this vision that could allow [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=701.56s)]
*  coordination devices and we can go from individual innovations and making the [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=709.24s)]
*  parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. In a way that's what we're [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=715.5600000000001s)]
*  trying to do at the VIS Innovation Hub. We also have started with very [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=724.2s)]
*  specific projects many of them do not fit together but now we're paying [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=730.2s)]
*  attention on how they can fit together and how can we use a platform that can [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=736.2s)]
*  invite more private sector participation and make the system work as a whole. In [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=741.5600000000001s)]
*  terms of the for example the projects that we have been doing let me [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=747.2s)]
*  mention two for example one is AGORA which is a first effort major [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=753.0s)]
*  effort where we're working with 40 commercial banks seven central banks to [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=760.08s)]
*  really streamline dramatically cross-border payments and this works [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=765.72s)]
*  based on the organization the enthusiasm is great and this could be a major [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=770.8000000000001s)]
*  platform to really make a cross-border payments extremely efficient and again [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=777.2s)]
*  this could be the infrastructure we are creating can be part of broader [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=784.0s)]
*  developments. The other is project PINE and project PINE basically uses I would [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=788.56s)]
*  say the three the trilogy that I find that is important for a financial [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=802.0799999999999s)]
*  way that Michelle expressed commercial bank digital money and a government [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=808.68s)]
*  securities in tokenized fashion and here the idea on the project PINE is how [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=816.88s)]
*  can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=821.88s)]
*  policy so even for those purposes the tokenization effort could be great. I [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=827.68s)]
*  would say that that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=833.24s)]
*  to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. Today again is [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=839.52s)]
*  difficult very difficult to make transactions a lot of progress has been [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=847.84s)]
*  made but at some point we need to achieve for example what [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=852.3199999999999s)]
*  in telecommunications was achieved many years ago like ten years ago you would [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=859.0799999999999s)]
*  have a messaging machine you would have to access internet through a different [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=863.88s)]
*  device you would have a different phone you would have your camera it would be [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=869.92s)]
*  tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. Today you can do [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=875.16s)]
*  it immediately because everything is integrated if we can do that in the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=880.76s)]
*  financial system we really would be making a huge breakthrough and the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=885.64s)]
*  important thing is that technology is there the technology is not the limiting [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=891.36s)]
*  factors what we need to work is on many different aspects regulation a [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=897.04s)]
*  regulation a coordination the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=903.28s)]
*  to make this reality I can comment that more about that later but in any case I [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=909.96s)]
*  think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. Thanks so much [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=915.88s)]
*  Agustin and yes so you know it's really the interplay between innovation which [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=921.96s)]
*  you know may go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=929.16s)]
*  a regulatory structure around that that is the current juncture in many aspects [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=937.24s)]
*  so Nandan you have worked with Agustin on this concept that you labeled the [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=947.28s)]
*  Finternet so you know a kind of you know global payment system that is just as [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=956.48s)]
*  seamless as the Internet I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=965.2s)]
*  something like the Internet existing and nowadays it is everywhere and I think [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=970.84s)]
*  the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=977.08s)]
*  services we could have such a seamless object so explain a little bit more [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=981.44s)]
*  you're thinking around that and particularly this intersection between [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=989.6s)]
*  the public and the private sector in that regard. Thank you I think I think [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=994.32s)]
*  technology has been integral to financial services for several decades [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1001.32s)]
*  and we have seen that whether it's in banking the branch you know mobile phone [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1006.0s)]
*  app payments are becoming instant you can order ETF or a mutual fund on a phone so [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1012.5200000000001s)]
*  clearly the financial sector has been the leadership or applying technology to [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1019.16s)]
*  financial services but all these solutions we have tend to be siloed [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1025.1599999999999s)]
*  purpose-specific infrastructure with their own applications their own data [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1030.32s)]
*  their own maintenance and clearly we have to think about doing some things [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1034.3999999999999s)]
*  differently and I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1039.44s)]
*  that it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things it's designing a [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1045.0s)]
*  new foundation where money and assets are programmable portable and [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1051.52s)]
*  interoperable from day one that's a huge transformation if we can pull it off and [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1056.92s)]
*  this is where the idea of the Finternet came in the thing is that they have in [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1062.48s)]
*  lot of efforts around the world on tokenization many central banks are [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1068.64s)]
*  trying to launch tokenized currency countries are talking about stable coins [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1073.6s)]
*  some people are trying to tokenize bonds deposits so we're seeing a lot of work [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1078.4399999999998s)]
*  happening but if you really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1083.04s)]
*  reasonable amount of time to be in this new financial metaphor then we have to [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1087.56s)]
*  think differently and the idea of the Internet came about because Augustine and [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1092.4399999999998s)]
*  I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023 and he had been [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1098.04s)]
*  writing about the Finternet writing about this new financial architecture [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1104.32s)]
*  and my colleagues and I promote Siddharth and myself had been working on [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1109.36s)]
*  population scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1115.04s)]
*  over the last several years so we got together and said can we apply that [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  population scale generic approach to tokenization and that's how was born the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1124.44s)]
*  idea of the Finternet and this was a paper which we started thinking about in [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1131.44s)]
*  February 23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24 now what we [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1137.3200000000002s)]
*  are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1144.96s)]
*  across the world so basically there are three important ways we look at it one [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1151.24s)]
*  is we should design this to be user centric it's not about institutions it's [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1157.68s)]
*  about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1164.28s)]
*  can buy sell transfer assets of any type so user centricity is a big fundamental [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1169.56s)]
*  belief in the Finternet the second is it should be a unified architecture for all [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1177.8s)]
*  types of assets in other words whether the asset is money or securities [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1185.24s)]
*  property liabilities whatever it is bonds they should all be able to work [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1191.0s)]
*  with the same infrastructure so this asset agnostic approach is very [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1196.04s)]
*  important to create a unified approach a third thing is that this is not for any [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1201.24s)]
*  purpose or geography but to create a universal infrastructure for the world [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1206.84s)]
*  which is capable of doing this and it should be able to be used anywhere and [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1211.3999999999999s)]
*  we felt that if we put this point of view across the net is creating a vision [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1216.56s)]
*  of what is possible possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1221.8799999999999s)]
*  now it's exactly a year since we released this paper it was April of 24 [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  and a lot has happened since then we find that the technology is actually quite mature enough [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1233.88s)]
*  we thought it was experimental but we believe it's more mature then second is that all of the world [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1240.76s)]
*  the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1246.1200000000001s)]
*  and I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere and as Augustine mentioned we we [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1253.16s)]
*  come from a background of actually getting things done so that's where we have been working in the [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1258.68s)]
*  last one year we have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1264.44s)]
*  how you do credentialing how you create wallets we have a universal information tokenized system [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1272.1200000000001s)]
*  and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1279.24s)]
*  using public chain technology but we're not ready to any technologies agnostic to which technology [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1286.76s)]
*  that we use and pilots are underway today both with central bankers and with companies and we [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1292.8400000000001s)]
*  think over the next year next few months by the end of by December of this year we'll actually [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1300.52s)]
*  have enough working technology to to show this working and these are in multiple areas deposits [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1305.8s)]
*  and you know wallets ledgers and so on so I think we believe that the time has come to really [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1313.4s)]
*  implement the internet approach and if we can work with making it user-centric universal and unified [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1321.16s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere and it's really [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1330.0400000000002s)]
*  a question of moving it now I think we we can demonstrate in the next few months the technology [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1336.44s)]
*  is not going to be the challenge technology will be available it will be available as open source [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1342.6s)]
*  any country any company can use it it's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1348.9199999999998s)]
*  the kind of assets that we want so that's where we are after one year and we are very confident [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1354.76s)]
*  that if the world embraces this approach we can get there much faster great thanks so much for [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1360.6s)]
*  for that insight let me turn back to to pierrot and you know ask about the the broader capital [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1368.76s)]
*  market implications I think Augustine and and mandan already alluded to to that and and michelle [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1379.0800000000002s)]
*  as well so how do you see sort of like you know how what central banks are doing [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1389.32s)]
*  on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments you know that are [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1397.3999999999999s)]
*  you know oftentimes beyond beyond the the normal operational reach of of central banks [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1405.48s)]
*  yes so you know this this question is particularly interesting for for the european market [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1412.36s)]
*  you know we came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented I don't even [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1420.76s)]
*  remember how many trading venues we have I think we are in the order of 41 we have something like [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1426.04s)]
*  27 csd europe it's hard to talk about capital market you know in this condition fragmentation [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1434.28s)]
*  is a high cost access to finance is a problem market-based finance for small and medium [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1444.04s)]
*  enterprise is a problem so we see our effort in terms of developing a you know a unified ledger [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1451.32s)]
*  some some new platform based on tokenization has also an effort an effort to improve the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1459.64s)]
*  condition of the capital at least the backbone of a financial capital unified financial capital [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1469.0s)]
*  markets in europe and to simplify I can simplify by thinking to to the to the dimension right the [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1474.44s)]
*  potential the transformational potential of dlp I think can be clustered in two groups [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1482.52s)]
*  as Augustine was saying we can think of things that we already do and that and we can do it in [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1489.0s)]
*  a more efficient way and those are the low hanging fruit and then there is another dimension what can [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1495.0s)]
*  we do with dlp tokenization that we don't do we cannot do today because of the way we treat money [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1502.2s)]
*  now on the first front is pretty simple right for just just to give you some some example [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1511.64s)]
*  dlp would allow you to trade 24 7 360 days so basically we could have a unified [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1518.92s)]
*  you know platform working working around the clock all year long second if you think today [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1528.44s)]
*  the three key function of the trading is you know the negotiation the settlement and the custody [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1536.12s)]
*  are done on the three different platforms you know we could bring on the dlp on the same platform [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1541.56s)]
*  the three function this would reduce reconciliation cost the time and and data processing third if you [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1548.4399999999998s)]
*  think the effort we are making to move to t plus something right through digitalization through [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1557.6399999999999s)]
*  dlp we could move to t plus zero immediately so all this at the end of the day would reduce cost [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1563.8s)]
*  and make it a more efficient market but the key key difference will be [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1572.04s)]
*  the as the thinking about the lt as a nibbler as has been said for new services and to me [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1579.72s)]
*  everything boils down to one single concept digitalization changes the nature of money [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1587.24s)]
*  money is not any longer a scriptural is a is a file a very sophisticated file but is a file [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1594.2s)]
*  so on a file you can put all the condition you want and so you can decide when to pay how to pay [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1601.88s)]
*  condition alone all possible state of the world so this is the kind of transformational that we need [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1608.76s)]
*  to to implement to to make a you know the the financial service and the financial sector to a [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1616.12s)]
*  different stage but let me conclude this is not an easy road it's a bumpy road and and many things [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1624.52s)]
*  can go wrong so we need to do it in a very attentive way because we can end up in new [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1630.84s)]
*  fragmentation we could end up in a system that where competition is low and we could [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1638.36s)]
*  end up in a situation we will be where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1644.68s)]
*  so we need you know something that avoid fermentation increase competition and make sure that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1651.0s)]
*  innovation state had even at the infrastructure level let me stop here thanks so much pierrot [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1657.5600000000002s)]
*  and I certainly hear no lack of ambition on on this panel I think [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1665.72s)]
*  pierrot you know really aims at at you know the broader financial market integration [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1673.6399999999999s)]
*  from the nun we heard you know a really a very foundational innovation around finance so [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1682.04s)]
*  michelle turning turning back to you how do you see the role of central banks in all of this [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1692.68s)]
*  you know money of course is the foundation of the financial system you know central banks have a [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1700.12s)]
*  clear mandate you know how can central banks help in this you know broader transition to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1707.0s)]
*  a new technological underpinning to innovation and as you already alluded to [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1715.56s)]
*  to this tight interconnection with the private sector thanks to bias and I think central banks [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1723.24s)]
*  do have a role our own one of our own strategic priorities at the reserve bank of Australia is [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1731.08s)]
*  to help shape the future of money now I don't mean dictate the future of money I don't mean [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1736.6799999999998s)]
*  mandate the future of money but I think helping to determine the future money is really important [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1742.28s)]
*  from our own perspective and I think many central banks we are all in the payment system [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1747.56s)]
*  we issue bank notes we're all operating rtgs systems in our own case we're also supervisors [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1752.04s)]
*  of financial market infrastructures which are a very important potential [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1760.04s)]
*  use case for tokenization so against all that I think it's incumbent upon central banks to [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1765.16s)]
*  take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector we need to be working with [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1770.36s)]
*  them I think so it it's sort of a catalyst role but it's also a little bit more than that I think [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1776.4399999999998s)]
*  it's a partnership a role as well and and I think what central banks can bring and I think what I [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1781.08s)]
*  think of ourselves of bringing is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1787.56s)]
*  what's in public policies interests as well because these things are yes it's commercial [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1795.72s)]
*  but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about so there is a very [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1802.28s)]
*  big public policy interest in this and well I think that's what central banks can bring to this [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1807.32s)]
*  so in our own thinking about this some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1813.3999999999999s)]
*  through these exercises are for example how will this innovation promote and be or be consistent [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1819.08s)]
*  with monetary and financial stability because that's obviously important to us what sort of [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1825.8s)]
*  issues are there for the tokenization of potential asset classes and how will they promote safety [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1832.2s)]
*  and resilience as well as efficiency of markets so I think these are really important questions [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1839.88s)]
*  and central banks bring that perspective to it I also think that if central banks come at it from [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1844.12s)]
*  just a very reactive way I think we'll be completely behind the curve and we might end up with [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1851.56s)]
*  circumstances which aren't ideal so for example at the moment we've already talked about the fact [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1856.9199999999998s)]
*  that settlement in central bank money is the safest is the safest way to do it it's not the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1863.8799999999999s)]
*  only way but it is and a lot of our high that all our high value systems at the moment they [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1868.84s)]
*  settle in central bank money so if we don't engage with this and think about how the new [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1874.12s)]
*  tokenization might be you might pair with with payments then we might get left out of it and [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1883.8799999999999s)]
*  that mightn't have good results for financial stability and and settlement risk so again we [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1890.84s)]
*  think we're not we're not going to drive this we're not going to tell people what to do but [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1898.28s)]
*  I think it's really important we're engaged in it how central banks central bank money might be [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1902.6799999999998s)]
*  used in these circumstances and what the policy implications might might be of that and there's [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1909.72s)]
*  another point here I think is worth making is that other regulatory authorities for example [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1918.28s)]
*  prudential regulators consumer regulators and the government are also potentially interested in all [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1922.6s)]
*  these issues as well so we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with the breadth of [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1929.3999999999999s)]
*  our stakeholders ultimately these sorts of things are networks and and they need lots of stakeholders [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1934.84s)]
*  cooperating in order to make them work so that's how I see our role. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1942.9199999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much Michelle and you know leading leading on to on to that let me turn back to [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1948.6799999999998s)]
*  Augustine and ask about the coordination cooperation across countries of course Michelle [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1956.52s)]
*  mentioned you know settlement issues but they also brought you know issues around governance and [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1965.48s)]
*  legal certainty which are extremely important across countries so how do you how do you see that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1976.92s)]
*  playing out across countries and not just advanced economies but also emerging markets [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1985.24s)]
*  and developing economies? Well it's very important to have coordination cooperation [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1990.68s)]
*  internationally but primarily I would say at the beginning nationally now the main coordination [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=1997.72s)]
*  has to be between authorities I think central banks should play a leading role but also how [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2005.0s)]
*  to engage with the private sector most of the development most of the operation whoever will [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2012.04s)]
*  be tokenizing assets will be the private sector now I think what is key is to steer the cooperation [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2018.04s)]
*  and to steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion what we see [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2028.04s)]
*  in technology is that they are very big players they tend to dominate the game and we can end up [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2034.12s)]
*  with world gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration so we need [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2042.76s)]
*  to exploit the energy the knowledge the resources of the private sector but in a way that brings [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2049.64s)]
*  together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody the other important part the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2056.12s)]
*  other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of of the features that we [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2063.48s)]
*  have in today's traditional banking system a pure quality old-fashioned I don't think it's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2072.04s)]
*  old-fashioned I think it's essential is to have the trust that central bank a central bank brings [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2077.96s)]
*  in itself which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality I think I think precisely [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2084.6s)]
*  to preserve that element of trust is essential so given these two conditions one that we need to [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2095.24s)]
*  sort of steer the the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust how [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2101.32s)]
*  should the central banks behave again let me let me emphasize number one we need to express much [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2108.36s)]
*  clearly and articulate more more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2117.56s)]
*  joint experimentation we need to get people working towards a common goal [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2125.88s)]
*  but we need to try to bring that picture together number two we need as as Michelle mentioned [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2132.04s)]
*  we need to to develop an appropriate regulatory framework this has to do we need regulatory [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2138.92s)]
*  clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets data privacy the legal enforceability of [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2145.88s)]
*  smart contracts and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2153.56s)]
*  counterparts we need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions but between [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2159.08s)]
*  traditional and new expressions of the financial system we need to be able to fully comply with [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2168.36s)]
*  the MLCFT and KYC. Third I think that again central banks and authorities should provide [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2175.0s)]
*  the basic foundational assets and platforms and this is something that happens today so it's not [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2184.68s)]
*  an additional ask of what we do today already now we have to do this in a way that it has the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2191.16s)]
*  adequate technological representation so here we're I'm talking about wholesale CBDC [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2199.64s)]
*  tokenized deposits and tokenized government bonds and to facilitate the tokenization of different [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2207.48s)]
*  different different assets and also we we might support the provision of basic financial [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2214.92s)]
*  infrastructure basically how to connect the unified layers to a support interoperability [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2224.44s)]
*  between the tokenized financial system and fourth I think we need to work for private public [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2232.36s)]
*  partnerships I think that is essential I think there is a lot that the private sector can bring [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2238.2000000000003s)]
*  to the table most of it I would say is there but we need to to to find ways to coordinate this [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2244.6s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing it will be tremendously powerful this [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2252.12s)]
*  towards these four goals and it would facilitate to to to get where where where we want in terms [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2258.92s)]
*  of coordination among central banks well that's what the BIS is there for I mean we are the bank [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2266.52s)]
*  of the central banks the fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2273.24s)]
*  of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter I mean we we we don't have a life [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2281.24s)]
*  on our own we respond to the needs of the central banks to the expression of interest so what we [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2287.4799999999996s)]
*  have done through the hope is is more than anything of an expression of a of of of the interest [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2294.2799999999997s)]
*  and the relevance that central bank attributes to to to this subject so in any way I think the BIS [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2302.7599999999998s)]
*  will continue supporting this effort and I think the IMF through through through to the reach you [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2311.0s)]
*  have to to to your universal membership your your capacity development and so on it can also [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2319.24s)]
*  facilitate more synergies in the in the among international institutions yeah thanks so much and [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2327.08s)]
*  and so you know one of the things you you pointed to is AML CFT and so Nandan so how do you think [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2335.56s)]
*  about the public and private sector interplay and more specifically so like on the one hand [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2348.12s)]
*  you know you want to have so like ease of of payments and privacy right which is foundational [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2356.36s)]
*  for money but on the other hand you need to ensure integrity IE AML CFT compliance so [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2365.8s)]
*  you know how do you think about that in in in the vision for the tokenized financial system [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2373.32s)]
*  well I think like everything else we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2378.6800000000003s)]
*  in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will govern the tokenization [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2384.76s)]
*  and once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined then market players will [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2392.5200000000004s)]
*  will innovate and create solutions and the third leg of that is technology because tokenization [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2398.1200000000003s)]
*  technology needs to be demystified and made available in a much larger way which is what [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2405.48s)]
*  we are doing which is creating internet labs across the world the US Europe India and Singapore [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2411.16s)]
*  and building the composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2418.8399999999997s)]
*  the deployment of tokenization in in the real world and I think over the next few years if [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2425.56s)]
*  we really put our hearts and minds on it we can actually see significant progress and it's really [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2431.24s)]
*  up to the people in this room to drive this because this has such enormous value for society [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2436.68s)]
*  such an enormous value for inclusion such enormous value for economic progress [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2443.7999999999997s)]
*  that we have to make every effort to expedite that and we are on this journey and anybody can [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2449.08s)]
*  join us if they want on the internet journey so please we are welcome okay thank you so much so [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2454.52s)]
*  this is the end of this fascinating panel I think there are many topics to explore let me again [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2462.12s)]
*  thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international community this is the last [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity but we are all [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2476.6s)]
*  looking forward to working with you in your next chapter thank you so much for all panelists and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2481.72s)]
*  thanks for your interest in this very important topic thank you [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2490.2s)]
*  and to stay on the specific of the of the wholesale we have been observing that there is a growing [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2498.9199999999996s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in improving [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2505.16s)]
*  the current situation of financial market essentially because DLT and tokenization [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2512.84s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form and these allow many new developments [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2520.6800000000003s)]
*  and we can we can dig on that later on in the discussion and we also observed that the same [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2528.92s)]
*  Europeans and the in Europe banks are pretty active on this on this field in the space [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2536.12s)]
*  from our contact with the market we see that 60 percent of the banks are interested in [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2543.08s)]
*  experimenting with DLT and actually something like 22 percent of them are already have already put in [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2548.84s)]
*  place some sort of application implementing DLT also on the security sides we have seen a growing [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2556.28s)]
*  interest in issuing that we have also the European level a specific legislation that allows that [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2568.6800000000003s)]
*  so this might you know improve the conditions so that bank venture more easily to this [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2575.2400000000002s)]
*  so so confronted with this scenario the ECB we we think that we need to be in this space very early [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2585.72s)]
*  on for two fundamental reasons the one reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2594.92s)]
*  money somebody else will be there we don't have anything against you know commercial bank money [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2601.0s)]
*  but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2607.32s)]
*  credit risk which is nearant into commercial bank money so that we need we need to be there [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2613.24s)]
*  immediately as a central bank money and the second reason is that market is asking us to be there [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2619.72s)]
*  from our contact with the market we we are encouraged to offer central bank money because [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2626.2s)]
*  market participants say that this is essential for the market to to develop so with this with [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2631.8799999999997s)]
*  this situation in mind last year from May to September well from November we launched we [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2640.12s)]
*  we launched an experiment a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2647.0s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could could settle this transaction in central bank money [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2656.2s)]
*  the concept we that we explore this concept of synchronization or [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2665.72s)]
*  coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services which is our traditional [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2672.2799999999997s)]
*  system the three central bank of the euro system they invented a very interesting solution so that [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2682.4399999999996s)]
*  you know you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank money [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2690.36s)]
*  in the RTGS basically the experiment have been a big success we are we had more than 60 participants [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2695.96s)]
*  exploring many use cases big issuance so a growing interest more than what we were expecting [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2704.44s)]
*  so the question is what do we do from there so we want to continue and get into production move from [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2711.4s)]
*  the experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise soon a solution in which [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2717.88s)]
*  through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in expanding their business [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2725.32s)]
*  on DLT while providing for us central bank money again we are not at this stage putting money [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2731.2400000000002s)]
*  on the DLT on the same on the same DLT where the assets are this is for the short term however we [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2738.6800000000003s)]
*  are talking also thinking about what to do in the long term in that and here we are open to a much [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2745.72s)]
*  more possible integrated solution where we we can have a you know a unified ledger where we could [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2751.3999999999996s)]
*  you could have on the same platform central bank money commercial bank money assets you know BIS [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2758.52s)]
*  has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility an alternative [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2765.7999999999997s)]
*  possibility would be to have a an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers which could take care [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2770.92s)]
*  you know with the special life of different use case or adapt to specific condition or even [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2779.56s)]
*  allow for a better transition from the traditional rtgs to this new to this new solution [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2788.6800000000003s)]
*  so the news is stay tuned more to come great thanks so much pierrot and let me just interject [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2795.56s)]
*  a little bit of a side note on vocabulary so when when our panelists talk about tokenization [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2803.72s)]
*  distributed ledger or blockchain these are fairly interchangeable to first order approximation so [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2812.2799999999997s)]
*  you know it is there are some minor differences but you know DLT tokenization and blockchain are [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2820.36s)]
*  more or less the same thing so augustine the BIS the bank for international settlement in basel [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2830.12s)]
*  has been very active through its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2838.36s)]
*  at the at the BIS in terms of working with central banks to you know explore innovation [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2847.2400000000002s)]
*  that can be beneficial for many countries around the world and you've been particularly working [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2856.44s)]
*  on tokenization you know with central bank but also with commercial banks and with technology [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2861.7200000000003s)]
*  firms so where are you you know having done this for a number of years now where is your thinking [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2868.68s)]
*  today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and so like the future of [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2874.6s)]
*  tokenization and finance well thank you thank you very much to be a safe creative in this panel [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2881.72s)]
*  we do very distinguished central bankers michelle pierrot and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2889.7999999999997s)]
*  thought leader nandan who knows how to make things to become reality and i think that's why it's [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2898.04s)]
*  great to have somebody like nandan here with us and of course i would say to be as he's an [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2905.16s)]
*  honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always very strong contributions [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2909.88s)]
*  in that respect now tokenization first is great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2917.08s)]
*  a discussion like this in organization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2927.0s)]
*  i think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2935.24s)]
*  and the financial systems in general i would say at least in two two directions they can make very [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2943.88s)]
*  important contribution first it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2951.0s)]
*  a the most where where more most developments have happened and most attention has been paid [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2958.04s)]
*  off is with payments and well obviously currencies but those are the most elementary type of [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2964.76s)]
*  transactions now today if you see how a payment is done what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2971.08s)]
*  complex tremendously cumbersome and it certainly would behoove us to make them far simpler and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2978.6s)]
*  that's something that tokenization can achieve today for example when you do a payment usually [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2988.12s)]
*  there is a separation between messaging reconciliation and settlement given that separation [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=2995.16s)]
*  many mistakes can be made controls can be lost especially on kyc aml cft if you integrate everything [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3001.32s)]
*  the efficiency of the system is quite assured and this can be applied not only for payments [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3011.32s)]
*  but for many other financial transactions in that sense tokenization also allows something that [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3019.0s)]
*  we can call programmability which is to put a everything all the instructions [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3026.44s)]
*  all the procedures regulation and so on in a contained a in a contained chip i would say [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3034.92s)]
*  that would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that we many of them [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3044.36s)]
*  for example we don't do today i mean traditionally if you have a discussion among economies [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3051.0s)]
*  many contingent the development of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3058.92s)]
*  in its application because we don't have a way to put them together and put put them into play [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3066.52s)]
*  tokenization definitely could facilitate this and therefore tokenization can really be the future [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3073.0s)]
*  of a of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine another very [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3081.4s)]
*  attractive aspect of the tokenization and of the technological development is the fact that it would [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3087.96s)]
*  allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today india for example is a great example [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3097.0s)]
*  and through one of the contributions and and that made happen which is the identity of people [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3106.68s)]
*  and to be able to map accounts with individuals in in an unmistakable way really what you can do [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3114.6s)]
*  is to leapfrog from being very backward very unsophisticated to something where [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3122.7599999999998s)]
*  you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being of the different [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3129.48s)]
*  nations the contribution of of this for inclusion is very very significant and that's why we are [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3135.3199999999997s)]
*  supporting this fully at the at the bis now one can ask ask make the following question why [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3146.36s)]
*  the take-up outside crypto has been slow in tech tokenization and i think part of it is because we [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3154.52s)]
*  have we have unleashed many efforts but those efforts are isolated we have not been fully been [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3162.28s)]
*  able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that we have tried it through the [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3171.72s)]
*  internet here in and then we'll speak later i also will speak later about it i really welcome what [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3179.24s)]
*  pierrot just said about the fact that the in the sphere of dcb you're trying to integrate central [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3185.64s)]
*  bank money a commercial bank money different assets and to have a joint vision to promote this [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3193.24s)]
*  if we have this vision a that could allow a coordination devices and we can go from [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3201.8799999999997s)]
*  individual innovations and making the parts a in a way a work together in in in a in a [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3209.24s)]
*  virtuous way in a way that's what we're trying to do at the vis innovation hub we also have [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3217.9599999999996s)]
*  started with very specific projects many of them do not fit together but now we're paying [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3225.0s)]
*  attention on how they can fit together and how can we use a platform that can invite more private [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3232.5200000000004s)]
*  sector participation and make the system work as a whole in terms of the for example the the the [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3238.92s)]
*  projects that we have been doing let me let me mention two for example one is is agora which is [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3246.1200000000003s)]
*  is is a first effort major effort where we're working with 40 commercial banks seven central [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3254.1200000000003s)]
*  banks to really streamline dramatically cross border payments and this base works based on [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3260.84s)]
*  technization the the enthusiasm is is great and this could be a major platform to really make a [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3267.56s)]
*  cross border payments extremely efficient and again this could be the infrastructure we are [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3276.52s)]
*  creating can be part of broader developments the other is is is is project pine and project pine [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3282.68s)]
*  basically uses i would say the three the trilogy that i find that is important for a financial [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3290.44s)]
*  system of the future to have in tokenized in tokenized way wholesale cvdc in the way that [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3298.44s)]
*  michelle expressed commercial bank digital money and a and a government securities in [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3306.12s)]
*  tokenized fashion and and here the idea on the project pine is how can this be used in an [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3314.04s)]
*  integrated way to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy so even for those purposes [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3320.6s)]
*  the tokenization effort could be great i would say that that our imagination is the limit in [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3327.08s)]
*  terms of using tokenization to to really shift the boundaries of the financial system today again is [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3333.4s)]
*  difficult very difficult to make transactions a lot of progress has been made but at some point [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3344.2s)]
*  we need to do we need to we need to to achieve for example what in telecommunications was achieved [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3350.44s)]
*  many years ago like 10 years ago you would have a messaging machine you would have to [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3357.96s)]
*  access internet through a different device you would have a different phone you would have your [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3364.28s)]
*  camera it would be tremendously difficult even to to to take a photograph and send it today you can [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3369.96s)]
*  do it immediately because everything is integrated if we can do that in the financial system we [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3376.84s)]
*  really would be making a huge breakthrough and the important thing is that technology is there [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3383.7200000000003s)]
*  the technology is not the limiting factors what we need to work is on many different aspects [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3390.2000000000003s)]
*  regulation a regulation a coordination the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3397.48s)]
*  to make this reality i can comment that more about that later but in any case i think that the [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3406.76s)]
*  tokenization has a big promise into the future thanks so much agustin and yes so [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3413.48s)]
*  you know it's really the interplay between innovation which you know may [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3421.32s)]
*  go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3429.32s)]
*  that that is the current juncture in in in many aspects so nandan you have worked with agustin [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3436.04s)]
*  on this concept that you labeled the fintanet so you know a kind of [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3449.24s)]
*  you know global payment system that is just as seamless as the internet i think [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3457.72s)]
*  30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet existing and nowadays it is [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3465.48s)]
*  everywhere and i think the internet so like gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and and [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3471.4s)]
*  financial services we could have such a seamless object so explain a little bit more your thinking [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3477.16s)]
*  around that and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3486.68s)]
*  regard oh thank you i think uh i think technology has been integral to financial services for several [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3492.6s)]
*  decades and we have seen that whether it's in banking the branch you now go to a mobile [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3502.12s)]
*  phone app payments are becoming instant you can order an etf or a mutual fund on a phone so clearly [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3508.6s)]
*  the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3516.44s)]
*  but all these solutions we have tend to be siloed purpose specific infrastructure with their own [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3523.4s)]
*  applications their own data their own maintenance and clearly we have to think about doing some [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3529.48s)]
*  things differently and i think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3535.5600000000004s)]
*  just digitizing the old way of doing things it's designing a new foundation where money and assets [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3542.84s)]
*  are programmable portable and interoperable from day one that's a huge transformation if we can [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3550.92s)]
*  pull it off and this is where the idea of the internet came in the thing is that they have [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3557.96s)]
*  been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization many central banks are trying to [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3564.76s)]
*  launch tokenized currency countries are talking about stable coins some people are trying to [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3570.2s)]
*  tokenize bonds deposits so we're seeing a lot of work happening but if we really want to move the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3575.56s)]
*  needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this new financial metaphor [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3581.56s)]
*  then we have to think differently and the idea of the internet came about because augustine and i [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3588.12s)]
*  met in banglore on the g20 meeting in february of 2023 and he had been writing about the internet [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3595.08s)]
*  writing about this new financial architecture and my colleagues and i promote siddharth and myself [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3603.08s)]
*  had been working on population scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3610.12s)]
*  the last several years so we got together and said can we apply that population scale generic approach [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3616.52s)]
*  to tokenization and that's how was born the idea of the internet and this was a paper which we [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3623.88s)]
*  started thinking about in february 23 and actually published the paper only in april of 24 [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3631.88s)]
*  now what we are trying to do is come out with a road map on how we can tokenize assets across the [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3640.28s)]
*  world so basically there are three important ways we look at it one is we should design this to be [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3648.68s)]
*  user-centric it's not about institutions it's about putting the power of tokenization in the [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3656.52s)]
*  hands of the user where the user can buy sell transfer assets of any type so user centricity [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3664.3599999999997s)]
*  is a big fundamental belief in the internet the second is it should be a unified architecture [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3672.6s)]
*  for all types of assets in other words whether the asset is you know money or securities property [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3681.0s)]
*  liabilities whatever it is bonds they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3687.96s)]
*  so this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach a third thing is that [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3694.52s)]
*  this is not for any purpose or geography but to create a universal infrastructure for the world [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3701.96s)]
*  which is capable of doing this and it should be able to be used anywhere and we felt that if we [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3707.96s)]
*  put this point of view across then at least creating a vision of what is possible possible [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3714.44s)]
*  and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion now it's exactly a year since we released this [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3720.52s)]
*  paper it was april of 24 and a lot has happened since then we find that the technology is actually [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3727.8s)]
*  quite mature enough we thought it was experimental but we believe it's more mature then second is [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3735.4s)]
*  that all of the world the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3741.48s)]
*  tokenized assets and i think there's a sense of possibility everywhere and as augustine mentioned [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3747.6400000000003s)]
*  we come from a background of actually getting things done so that's where we have been working [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3754.6800000000003s)]
*  in the last one year we have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3760.52s)]
*  how you do credentialing how you would create wallets we have a universal information tokenized [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3768.44s)]
*  system and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3774.6000000000004s)]
*  using public chain technology but we're not wedded to any technology it's agnostic to which [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3783.08s)]
*  technology that we use and pilots are underway today both with central bankers and with companies [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3788.6s)]
*  and we think over the next year next few months by the end of by december of this year we'll [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3796.6s)]
*  actually have enough working technology to to show this working and these are in multiple areas [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3801.88s)]
*  deposits and you know wallets ledgers and so on so i think we believe that the time has come [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3809.16s)]
*  to really implement the internet approach and if we can work with making it user-centric universal [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3816.7599999999998s)]
*  and unified we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3824.8399999999997s)]
*  and it's really a question of moving it now i think we we can demonstrate in the next few months [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3831.8799999999997s)]
*  that technology is not going to be the challenge technology will be available it will be available [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3838.2s)]
*  as open source any country any company can use it it's really about applying it in a regulatory [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3844.04s)]
*  framework for the kind of assets that we want so that's where we are after one year and we are [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3850.04s)]
*  very confident that if the world embraces this approach we can get there much faster [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3855.8799999999997s)]
*  Great thanks so much for for that insight. Let me turn back to to Piero and [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3861.32s)]
*  you know ask about the the broader capital market implications. I think [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3871.2400000000002s)]
*  Augustine and Nandan already alluded to to that and and Michelle as well so how do you see sort of like [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3877.56s)]
*  sort of like you know how what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3888.2s)]
*  capital market developments you know that are you know oftentimes beyond beyond the the normal [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3897.48s)]
*  operational reach of central banks. So you know this this question is particularly interesting [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3905.48s)]
*  for for the European market. You know we come from a situation where our markets are completely [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3914.6s)]
*  fragmented I don't even remember how many trading venues we have I think we are in the order of 41 [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3920.8399999999997s)]
*  we have something like 27 CSD in Europe. It's hard to talk about capital market [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3928.92s)]
*  you know in this condition fragmentation is a high cost access to finance is a problem [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3936.6000000000004s)]
*  market-based finance for small medium enterprise is a problem so we see our effort in terms of [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3945.0800000000004s)]
*  developing you know a unified ledger or some some new platform based on tokenization as also an [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3953.4s)]
*  effort an effort to improve the condition of the capital at least the backbone of a financial [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3962.84s)]
*  capital unified financial capital markets in Europe and to simplify I can simplify by thinking to to [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3969.08s)]
*  to the dimension right the potential the transformational potential of DLP I think can be [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3977.32s)]
*  clustered in two groups as Augustine was saying we can think of things that we already do and that [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3983.2400000000002s)]
*  and we can do it in a more efficient way and those are the low hanging fruit and then there [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3990.44s)]
*  is another dimension what can we do with DLT tokenization that we don't do we cannot do today [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=3996.12s)]
*  because of the way we treat money now on the first front is pretty simple right for just just to give [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4005.0s)]
*  you some some example DLT would allow you to trade 24 7 360 days so basically we could have a unified [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4012.28s)]
*  you know platform working working around the clock all year long second if you think today [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4024.76s)]
*  the three key function of the trading is you know the negotiation the settlement and the [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4032.44s)]
*  custody are done on the three different platforms you know we could bring on the DLT on the same [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4037.16s)]
*  platform the three function this would reduce reconciliation costs the time and and data [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4044.2799999999997s)]
*  processing third if you think the effort we are making to move to t plus something right [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4051.16s)]
*  through digitalization through DLT we could move to t plus zero immediately so all this at the end [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4057.88s)]
*  of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market but the key key difference will be [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4065.72s)]
*  the as the thinking about DLT as a nibbler as has been said for new services and to me everything [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4076.04s)]
*  boils down to one single concept digitalization changes the nature of money money is not any [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4084.12s)]
*  longer a scriptural is a is a file a very sophisticated file but is a file so on a file [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4091.96s)]
*  you can put all the conditions you want and so you can decide when to pay how to pay conditional on [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4099.08s)]
*  all possible state of the world so this is the kind of transformational that we need to to [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4106.28s)]
*  implement to to make a you know the the financial service and the financial sector to a different [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4114.28s)]
*  stage but let me conclude this is not an easy road it's a bumpy road and and many things can go [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4121.32s)]
*  wrong so we need to do it in a very attentive way because we can end up in new fragmentation [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4127.639999999999s)]
*  we could end up in a system that where competition is low and we could end up in a situation we will [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4136.12s)]
*  be where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time so we need you know something that [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4142.84s)]
*  avoid fermentation increase competition and make sure that innovation state had even at the [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4149.64s)]
*  infrastructure level let me stop here thanks so much pierrot and i i certainly hear no lack of [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4156.68s)]
*  ambition on on this panel i think pierrot you know really aims at at you know the broader [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4165.96s)]
*  financial market integration from the nun we heard you know a really a very foundational [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4175.96s)]
*  innovation around finance so michelle turning turning back to you how do you see the role of [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4185.4s)]
*  central banks in all of this you know money of course is the foundation of the financial system [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4193.32s)]
*  you know central banks have a clear mandate you know how can central banks help in this [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4201.56s)]
*  you know broader transition to a new technological underpinning to innovation and as you already [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4208.6s)]
*  alluded to to this tight interconnection with the private sector thanks to us i think central banks [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4218.04s)]
*  do have a role our own one of our own strategic priorities at the reserve bank of australia is to [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4227.4s)]
*  help shape the future of money now i don't mean dictate the future of money i don't mean mandate [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4233.24s)]
*  the future of money but i think helping to determine the future money is really important [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4239.16s)]
*  from our own perspective and i think many central banks we are all in the payment system we issue [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4243.879999999999s)]
*  bank notes we're all operating rtgs systems in our own case we're also supervisors of [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4249.16s)]
*  financial market infrastructures which are a very important potential use case for tokenization [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4256.92s)]
*  so against all that i think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4263.8s)]
*  and work with the commercial sector we need to be working with them i think so it it's sort of a [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4268.04s)]
*  catalyst role but it's also a little bit more than that i think it's a partnership a role as well [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4274.76s)]
*  and and i think what central banks can bring and i think what i think of ourselves of of bringing [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4280.2s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public what's in public policies interests as [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4286.6s)]
*  well because these things are yes it's commercial but it's really critical to the economy for all [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4294.4400000000005s)]
*  the reasons we've spoken about so there is a very big public policy interest in this and well and [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4301.32s)]
*  i think that's what central banks can bring to this so in our own thinking about this some of [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4305.96s)]
*  the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises are for example how will [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4312.28s)]
*  this innovation promote and be or be consistent with monetary and financial stability because [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4318.759999999999s)]
*  that's obviously important to us what sort of issues are there for the tokenization of potential [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4324.44s)]
*  asset classes and how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets so i [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4331.5599999999995s)]
*  think these are really important questions and central banks bring that perspective to it [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4338.92s)]
*  i also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way i think we'll be [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4344.92s)]
*  completely behind the curve and we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal so for [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4350.52s)]
*  example at the moment we've already talked about the fact that settlement and central bank money is [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4357.08s)]
*  the safest is the safest way to do it it's not the only way but it is and a lot of our high that all [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4362.28s)]
*  our high value systems at the moment they settle in central bank money so if we don't engage with [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4368.44s)]
*  this and think about how the new tokenization might be you might pair with with payments then [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4377.0s)]
*  we might get left out of it and that mightn't have good results for financial stability and [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4385.639999999999s)]
*  and settlement risk so again we think we're not we're not going to drive this we're not going to [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4391.5599999999995s)]
*  tell people what to do but i think it's really important we're engaged in it how central banks [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4397.88s)]
*  central bank money might be used in these circumstances and what the policy implications [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4404.52s)]
*  might might be of that and there's another point here i think is worth making is that other [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4409.96s)]
*  regulatory authorities for example prudential regulators consumer regulators and the government [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4417.0s)]
*  are also potentially interested in all these issues as well so we need to be [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4423.8s)]
*  thinking about who we're partnering with the breadth of our stakeholders ultimately these [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4428.4400000000005s)]
*  sorts of things are networks and and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4433.16s)]
*  them work so that's how i see our role thanks so much michelle and you know leading leading on to [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4440.68s)]
*  uh onto that let me turn back to augustine and ask about the coordination cooperation across [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4450.6s)]
*  countries of course michelle mentioned you know settlement issues but they also broader [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4457.96s)]
*  you know issues around governance and and legal certainty which are extremely [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4469.0s)]
*  important across countries so so how do you how do you see that [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4476.76s)]
*  playing out across countries and not just advanced economies but also emerging markets [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4481.56s)]
*  and and developing economies well it's very important to have coordination cooperation [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4487.0s)]
*  internationally but primarily i would say at the beginning nationally now the the main coordination [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4494.04s)]
*  has to be between authorities i think central banks should play a leading role [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4501.4s)]
*  but also how to engage with the private sector most of the development most of the operation [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4507.4s)]
*  whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector now i think what is key is to steer [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4513.719999999999s)]
*  the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion what [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4523.32s)]
*  we see in technology is that they are very big players they tend to dominate the the game and [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4529.8s)]
*  we can end up with world gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4538.28s)]
*  so we need to exploit the energy the knowledge the resources of the private sector but in a way [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4545.08s)]
*  that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody the other [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4551.8s)]
*  important part the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of of [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4558.84s)]
*  the features that we have in today's traditional banking system a pure quality old-fashioned i [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4567.32s)]
*  don't think it's old-fashioned i think it's essential is to have the trust that central bank [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4573.8s)]
*  a central bank brings in itself which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4579.56s)]
*  i think i think precisely to to preserve that element of trust is essential so given these two [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4587.8s)]
*  conditions one that we need to sort of steer the the participation of the private sector and to [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4596.12s)]
*  preserve this trust how should the central banks behave again let me let me emphasize number one [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4602.68s)]
*  we need to express much clearly and articulate more more clearly what is the vision in a way [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4612.28s)]
*  that this can facilitate joint experimentation we need to get people working towards a common goal [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4619.5599999999995s)]
*  but we need to try to bring that picture together number two we need as as michelle mentioned we [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4628.36s)]
*  need to to develop an appropriate regulatory framework this has to do we need regulatory [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4635.48s)]
*  clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets data privacy the legal enforceability of [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4642.2s)]
*  smart contracts and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4649.879999999999s)]
*  we need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions but between traditional [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4656.76s)]
*  and new expressions of the financial system we need to be able to fully comply with the mlcft [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4665.56s)]
*  and k y c third i think that again central banks and authorities should provide the basic [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4672.360000000001s)]
*  foundational assets and platforms and this is something that happens today so it's not an [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4681.72s)]
*  additional ask of what we do today already now we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4688.12s)]
*  technological representation so here we're i'm talking about wholesale cvdc a tokenized deposits [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4696.68s)]
*  and tokenized government bonds and to facilitate the tokenization of different different [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4705.8s)]
*  different assets and also we we might support a the provision of basic financial infrastructure [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4712.360000000001s)]
*  basically how to connect the unified layers to a support interoperability between the tokenized [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4722.04s)]
*  financial system and fourth i think we need to work for private public partnerships i think that [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4729.88s)]
*  is essential i think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table most of it i would [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4736.52s)]
*  say is there but we need to to to find ways to coordinate this i think a lot of the work that [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4743.08s)]
*  nandan is doing it will be tremendously powerful this towards these four four goals and it would [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4750.04s)]
*  facilitate to to to get where where where we want in terms of coordination among central banks well [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4757.88s)]
*  that's what the bis is there for i mean we are the bank of the central banks the fact that the bis [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4765.0s)]
*  has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4773.32s)]
*  in this subject matter i mean we we we don't have a life on our own we respond to the needs of the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4779.8s)]
*  central banks to the expression of interest so what we have done through the hope is is more than [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4787.16s)]
*  anything of an expression of a of of of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4793.8s)]
*  to this object so in any way i think the bis will continue supporting this effort and i think the [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4802.76s)]
*  imf through through through to the reach you have to to to your universal membership [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4812.2s)]
*  your your capacity development and so on it can also facilitate more synergies in the in the among [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4819.4s)]
*  international institutions yeah thanks so much and so you know one of the things you you pointed to [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4827.4s)]
*  is emlcft and so nandan so how do you think about the public and private sector interplay [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4838.36s)]
*  and more specifically so like on the one hand you know you want to have so like ease of of payments [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4848.839999999999s)]
*  and privacy right which is foundational for money but on the other hand you need to ensure [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4858.599999999999s)]
*  integrity i am lcft compliance so you know how do you think about that in in in the vision for the [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4865.32s)]
*  tokenized financial system well i think like everything else we have to find the balance [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4873.5599999999995s)]
*  between the role of the public sector in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4878.36s)]
*  govern the tokenization and once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined then [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4885.48s)]
*  market players will will innovate and create solutions and the third leg of that is technology [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4892.84s)]
*  because tokenization technology needs to be demystified and made available in a much larger [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4899.64s)]
*  way which is what we are doing which is creating internet labs across the world the us europe india [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4906.68s)]
*  and singapore and building the composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4913.88s)]
*  the deployment of tokenization in in the real world and i think over the next few years if [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4921.88s)]
*  we really put our hearts and minds on it we can actually see significant progress and it's really [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4927.64s)]
*  up to the people in this room to drive this because this has such enormous value for society [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4933.0s)]
*  such enormous value for inclusion such enormous value for economic progress that we have to make [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4940.12s)]
*  every effort to expedite that and we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4946.44s)]
*  the internet journey so please we are welcome okay thank you so much so this is the end of [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4951.88s)]
*  this fascinating panel i think there are many topics to explore let me again thank augustine [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4959.719999999999s)]
*  particularly for his long service in the international community this is the last time you are at one of [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4966.04s)]
*  these i'm evolving meetings in official capacity but we are all looking forward to working with you [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4974.52s)]
*  in your next chapter thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4980.200000000001s)]
*  very important topic thank you and that to stay on the specific of the of the wholesale we have [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4989.240000000001s)]
*  been observing that there is a growing interest from market participants to explore how tokenization [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=4999.799999999999s)]
*  and dlt can play a role in improving the current situation of financial financial market essentially [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5006.28s)]
*  because dlt and tokenization allow a different representation of asset in a digital form and [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5014.36s)]
*  this allow many new developments and we can we can dig on that later on in the discussion [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5022.36s)]
*  and we also observe that the europeans and the in europe banks are pretty active on this on this [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5030.599999999999s)]
*  field in this space from our contact with the market we see that 60 percent of the banks [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5037.4s)]
*  are interested in experimenting with dlt and actually something like 22 percent of them are [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5044.04s)]
*  have already put in place some sort of application implementing dlt also on the security sides we [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5051.56s)]
*  have seen a growing a growing interest in issuing that we have also the european level a specific [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5062.84s)]
*  legislation that allows that so this might have you know improved the the conditions so that bank [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5069.4s)]
*  venture more easily into this so [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5079.400000000001s)]
*  so confronted with this scenario the ecb we we think that we need to be in this space very early [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5084.92s)]
*  on for two fundamental reasons the one reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5091.24s)]
*  money somebody else will be there we don't have anything against you know commercial bank money [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5097.24s)]
*  but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5103.56s)]
*  and credit risk which is nearant into commercial bank money so that we need we need to be there [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5109.320000000001s)]
*  immediately as a central bank money and the second reason is that market is asking us to be there [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5115.96s)]
*  from our contact with the market we we are encouraged to offer central bank money because [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5122.4400000000005s)]
*  market participants say that this is essential for the market to to develop so with this with [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5128.12s)]
*  this situation in mind last year from may to september well from november we launched we [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5136.36s)]
*  we launched an experiment a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5143.24s)]
*  to experiment and ask transaction on dlt could could settle this transaction in central bank [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5152.44s)]
*  money the concept we that we explore was this concept of synchronization or [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5161.24s)]
*  coordination of the asset transaction on dlt with our target services which is our traditional [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5168.5199999999995s)]
*  system the three central bank of the euro system they invented a very [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5178.68s)]
*  interesting solution so that you know you could coordinate the transaction on the lt and the [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5184.6s)]
*  settlement on central bank money in the rtgs basically the experiment have been a big success [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5190.12s)]
*  we are we had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases big issuance so a growing interest [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5196.92s)]
*  more than what we were expecting so the question is what do we do from there so we want to continue [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5205.48s)]
*  and get into production move from the experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5212.04s)]
*  soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5219.32s)]
*  expanding their business on dlt while providing for us central bank money again we are not at [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5225.799999999999s)]
*  this stage putting money on the dlt on the same on the same dlt where the assets are this is for [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5233.0s)]
*  the short term however we are talking also thinking about what to do in the long term in that [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5239.96s)]
*  and here we are open to a much more possible integrated solution where we we can have a and [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5246.04s)]
*  you know a unified ledger where we could you could have on the same platform central bank money [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5252.52s)]
*  commercial bank money assets you know bis has been very vocal about the benefits of all this [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5258.6s)]
*  and this is a possibility an alternative possibility would be to have a an ecosystem of [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5265.0s)]
*  fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of you know with the special life of different [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5271.0s)]
*  use case or adapt to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5277.88s)]
*  rtgs to this new to this new solution so the news is stay tuned more to come great thanks so [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5287.96s)]
*  much pierrot and let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary so when when our [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5296.92s)]
*  panelists talk about tokenization distributed ledger or blockchain these are fairly interchangeable [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5305.96s)]
*  to first order approximation so you know it is there are some minor differences but you know dlt [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5313.72s)]
*  tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing so augustine the bis the bank [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5324.36s)]
*  for international settlement in basel has been very active through its innovation hub in particular [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5331.88s)]
*  but also its other activities at the at the bis in terms of working with central banks [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5339.8s)]
*  to you know explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5348.68s)]
*  and you've been particularly working on tokenization you know with central bank but [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5356.28s)]
*  also with commercial banks and with technology firms so where are you you know having done this [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5361.32s)]
*  for a number of years now where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5368.52s)]
*  financial system and so like the future of tokenization and finance well thank you thank you very [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5374.52s)]
*  much to be i say it's great to be in this panel we do very distinguished central bankers michelle [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5383.160000000001s)]
*  pierrot and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur thought leader nandan who knows how to make things [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5389.0s)]
*  become reality and i think that's why it's great to have somebody like nandan here with us and of [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5398.92s)]
*  course i would say to be as he's an honorary member of the central banking community because [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5404.52s)]
*  he makes always very strong contributions in that respect now tokenization first is great that it [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5409.8s)]
*  has become a topic under which we can have a discussion like this in tokenization in terms [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5419.400000000001s)]
*  of its applicability to financial transactions i think tokenization has a huge potential to [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5427.4s)]
*  contribute to our financial transactions and the financial systems in general i would say at least [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5437.16s)]
*  in two two directions they can make very important contribution first it certainly can improve the [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5444.5199999999995s)]
*  way the financial system works today the most where more most developments have happened and [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5451.24s)]
*  more most attention has been paid off is with payments and well obviously currencies but those [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5458.679999999999s)]
*  are the most elementary type of transactions now today if you see how a payment is done what goes [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5465.639999999999s)]
*  behind the scenes is tremendously complex tremendously a cumbersome and it certainly [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5472.44s)]
*  would be who was to make them far simpler and that's something that organization can achieve [[01:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5480.759999999999s)]
*  today for example when you do a payment usually there is a separation between messaging [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5487.5599999999995s)]
*  reconciliation and settlement given that separation many mistakes can be made controls can be lost [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5493.96s)]
*  especially on kyc aml cft if you integrate everything the efficiency of the system is [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5500.68s)]
*  quite assured and this can be applied not only for payments but for many other financial transactions [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5510.84s)]
*  in that sense tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability which is to [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5518.92s)]
*  put a everything all the instructions all the procedures regulation and so on in a contained [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5526.84s)]
*  in a contained chip i would say that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5538.44s)]
*  to the point that we many of them for example we don't do today i mean traditionally if you [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5544.92s)]
*  have a discussion among economists many contingent the development of contingent [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5552.52s)]
*  assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we don't have a way to [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5559.8s)]
*  put them together and put put them into play tokenization definitely could facilitate this [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5565.8s)]
*  and therefore tokenization can really be the future of a of a financial system with the [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5573.64s)]
*  sophistication that today we cannot imagine another very attractive aspect of the tokenization [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5580.28s)]
*  and of technological development is the fact that it would allow many countries to leapfrog [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5587.24s)]
*  from where they are today india for example is a great example and through one of the contributions [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5597.5599999999995s)]
*  and and that made happen which is the identity of people and to be able to map [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5605.5599999999995s)]
*  accounts with individuals in in an unmistakable way really what you can do is to leapfrog [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5612.759999999999s)]
*  from being very backward very unsophisticated to something where you really can achieve the [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5620.599999999999s)]
*  financial system contribute to the well-being of the different nations the contribution of of this [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5627.56s)]
*  for inclusion is very very significant and that's why we are supporting this fully at the at the [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5637.080000000001s)]
*  bis now one can ask ask make the following question why the take off outside crypto has been slow [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5645.56s)]
*  in tech tokenization and i think part of it is because we have we have unleashed [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5654.599999999999s)]
*  many efforts but those efforts are isolated we have not been fully been able to fully [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5661.5599999999995s)]
*  come with a vision of how can we integrate that we have tried it through the internet here in [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5670.36s)]
*  nandan will speak later i also will speak later about it i really welcome what pierrot just said [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5676.599999999999s)]
*  about the fact that the in the sphere of dcb you're trying to integrate central bank money [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5682.84s)]
*  commercial bank money different assets and to have a joint vision to promote this if we have [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5690.84s)]
*  this vision that could allow a coordination devices and we can go from individual innovations [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5698.76s)]
*  and making the parts a in a way a work together in in in a in a virtuous way [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5707.4s)]
*  in a way that's what we're trying to do at the vius innovation hub we also have have started with [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5715.799999999999s)]
*  very specific projects many of them do not fit together but now we're paying attention on how [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5722.5199999999995s)]
*  they can fit together and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5729.799999999999s)]
*  participation and make the system work as a whole in terms of the for example the the the projects [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5735.64s)]
*  that we have been doing let me let me mention two for example one is is agora which is a is is a [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5742.84s)]
*  first effort major effort where we're working with 40 commercial banks seven central banks [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5751.08s)]
*  to really streamline dramatically cross-border payments and this base works based on [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5758.12s)]
*  mechanization the the enthusiasm is is great and this could be a major platform to really make a [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5763.88s)]
*  cross-border payments extremely efficient and again this could be the infrastructure we are [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5772.68s)]
*  creating can be part of broader developments the other is is is is project pine and project pine [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5778.92s)]
*  basically uses i would say the three the trilogy that i find that is important for a financial [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5786.76s)]
*  system of the future to have in tokenized in tokenized way wholesale cbdc in the way that [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5794.68s)]
*  michelle expressed commercial bank digital money and a and a government securities in tokenized [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5802.360000000001s)]
*  fashion and and here the idea on the project pine is how can this be used in an integrated way [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5810.92s)]
*  to facilitate the implementation of monetary policy so even for those purposes the tokenization [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5817.8s)]
*  effort could be great i would say that that our imagination is the limit in terms of using [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5824.4400000000005s)]
*  tokenization to to really shift the boundaries of the financial system today again is difficult [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5831.08s)]
*  very difficult to make transactions a lot of progress has been made but at some point we need [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5841.08s)]
*  to do we need we need to to achieve for example what in telecommunications was achieved many years [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5847.0s)]
*  ago like 10 years ago you would have a messaging machine you would have to access internet through [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5854.76s)]
*  a different device you would have a different phone you would have your camera it would be [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5861.96s)]
*  tremendously difficult even to to to take a photograph and send it today you can do it [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5867.8s)]
*  immediately because everything is integrated if we can do that in the financial system [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5873.56s)]
*  we really would be making a huge breakthrough and the important thing is that technology is there [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5879.72s)]
*  the technology is not the limiting factors what we need to work is on many different aspects [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5886.52s)]
*  regulation a regulation a coordination the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5893.72s)]
*  to make this reality i can comment that more about that later but in any case i think that the [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5903.0s)]
*  tokenization has a big promise into the future thanks so much agustin and yes so [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5909.64s)]
*  you know it's really the interplay between innovation which you know may [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5917.56s)]
*  go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5925.56s)]
*  that that is the current juncture in in in many aspects so nadam you have worked with agustin [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5932.280000000001s)]
*  on this concept that you labeled the internet so you know a kind of [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5945.4800000000005s)]
*  you know global payment system that is just as seamless as the internet i think 30 or so years [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5953.96s)]
*  ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet existing and nowadays it is everywhere [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5962.6s)]
*  and i think the internet so like gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and and financial [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5969.08s)]
*  services we could have such a seamless object so explain a little bit more your thinking around [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5974.28s)]
*  that and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5983.32s)]
*  thank you i think i think technology has been integral to financial services for several [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5991.0s)]
*  decades and we have seen that whether it's in banking the branch you now go to a mobile [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=5998.44s)]
*  phone app payments are becoming instant you can order an etf or a mutual fund on a phone so clearly [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6004.839999999999s)]
*  the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6012.679999999999s)]
*  but all these solutions we have tend to be siloed purpose specific infrastructure with their own [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6019.639999999999s)]
*  applications their own data their own maintenance and clearly we have to think about doing some [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6025.72s)]
*  things differently and i think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6031.8s)]
*  about just digitizing the old way of doing things it's designing a new foundation where money and [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6038.76s)]
*  assets are programmable portable and interoperable from day one now that's a huge transformation [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6046.6s)]
*  if we can pull it off and this is where the idea of the internet came in the thing is that they [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6053.72s)]
*  have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization many central banks are trying to [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6060.84s)]
*  launch tokenized currency countries are talking about stable coins some people are trying to [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6066.4400000000005s)]
*  tokenize bonds deposits so we're seeing a lot of work happening but if we really want to move the [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6071.8s)]
*  needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this new financial metaphor [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6077.88s)]
*  then we have to think differently and the idea of the internet came about because augustine and i [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6084.4400000000005s)]
*  met in banglore on the g20 meeting in february of 2023 and he had been writing about the internet [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6091.400000000001s)]
*  writing about this new financial architecture and my colleagues and i promote siddharth and myself [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6099.32s)]
*  had been working on population scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6106.44s)]
*  the last several years so we got together and said can we apply that population scale generic approach [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6112.839999999999s)]
*  to tokenization and that's how was born the idea of the internet and this was a paper which we [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6120.2s)]
*  started thinking about in february 23 and actually published the paper only in april of 24 [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6128.2s)]
*  now what we are trying to do is come out with a road map on how we can tokenize assets across the [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6136.5199999999995s)]
*  world so basically there are three important ways we look at it one is we should design this to be [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6144.919999999999s)]
*  user-centric it's not about institutions it's about putting the power of tokenization in the [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6152.759999999999s)]
*  hands of the user where the user can buy sell transfer assets of any type so user-centricity [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6160.6s)]
*  is a big fundamental belief in the internet the second is it should be a unified architecture [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6168.84s)]
*  for all types of assets in other words whether the asset is uh you know money or securities [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6177.160000000001s)]
*  property liabilities whatever it is bonds they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6183.56s)]
*  so this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach a third thing is that [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6190.76s)]
*  this is not for any purpose or geography but to create a universal infrastructure for the world [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6198.200000000001s)]
*  which is capable of doing this and it should be able to be used anywhere and we felt that if we [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6204.200000000001s)]
*  put this point of view across then at least creating a vision of what is possible possible [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6210.68s)]
*  and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion now it's exactly a year since we [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6216.84s)]
*  released this paper it was april of 24 and a lot has happened since then we find that the technology [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6223.4800000000005s)]
*  is actually quite mature enough we thought it was experimental but we believe it's more mature [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6231.08s)]
*  then second is that all of the world the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6236.68s)]
*  having uh tokenized assets and i think there's a sense of possibility everywhere and as augustine [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6242.92s)]
*  mentioned we we come from a background of actually getting things done so that's where we have been [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6250.2s)]
*  working in the last one year we have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6256.4400000000005s)]
*  look like how you do credentialing how you would create wallets we have a universal information [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6263.72s)]
*  tokenized system and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6270.28s)]
*  transaction level using public chain technology but we're not wedded to any technologies agnostic [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6277.8s)]
*  to which technology that we use and pilots are underway today both with central bankers and with [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6284.44s)]
*  companies and we think over the next year next few months by the end of by december of this year [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6291.639999999999s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to to show this working and these are in multiple [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6297.88s)]
*  areas deposits and you know wallets ledgers and so on so i think we believe that the time has come [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6304.92s)]
*  to really implement the internet approach and if we can work with making it user-centric universal [[01:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6313.0s)]
*  and unified we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6321.08s)]
*  and it's really a question of moving it now i think we we can demonstrate in the next few months [[01:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6328.2s)]
*  that technology is not going to be the challenge technology will be available it will be available [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6334.52s)]
*  as open source any country any company can use it it's really what applying it in a regulatory [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6340.36s)]
*  framework for the kind of assets that we want so that's where we are after one year and we are [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6346.36s)]
*  very confident that if the world embraces this approach we can get there much faster [[01:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6352.2s)]
*  great thanks so much for for that insight let me turn back to to pierrot and [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6359.8s)]
*  you know ask about the the broader capital market implications i think [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6368.36s)]
*  um agustin and nandan already alluded to uh to that um and and michelle as well [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6373.96s)]
*  so how do you see sort of like you know how what central banks are doing [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6383.08s)]
*  on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments um you know that are [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6390.04s)]
*  are often times beyond the normal operational reach of central banks. [[01:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6396.6s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6406.52s)]
*  You know we come from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6413.72s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6418.360000000001s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6422.68s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[01:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6425.0s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6429.4800000000005s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6435.8s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6438.6s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6441.56s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6445.8s)]
*  because some new platform based on tokenization is also an effort [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6452.36s)]
*  to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a financial [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6459.96s)]
*  capital, unified financial capital markets in Europe. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6465.719999999999s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension, right? [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6469.32s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT I think can be clustered [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6475.4s)]
*  into two groups. [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6480.36s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6481.88s)]
*  it in a more efficient way. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6487.639999999999s)]
*  And those are the low hanging fruit. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6489.5599999999995s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6492.2s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6494.5199999999995s)]
*  we treat money? [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6502.679999999999s)]
*  Now on the first front it's pretty simple, right? [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6504.44s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6507.639999999999s)]
*  So basically we could have a unified platform working around the clock all [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6516.92s)]
*  year long. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6525.32s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key function of the trading is the [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6526.759999999999s)]
*  negotiation, the settlement, and the custody are done on the three different [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6531.879999999999s)]
*  platforms, we could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6535.8s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6542.280000000001s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, [[01:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6549.16s)]
*  right, through digitalization, through DLT we could move to T plus zero [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6553.72s)]
*  immediately. [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6559.08s)]
*  So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6560.679999999999s)]
*  market. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6567.48s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a new blur, as has been said [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6568.599999999999s)]
*  for new services. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6577.48s)]
*  And to me everything boils down to one single concept. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6579.5599999999995s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6583.5599999999995s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file, a very sophisticated file, [[01:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6587.0s)]
*  but it's a file. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6593.4800000000005s)]
*  So on a file you can put all the conditions you want and so you can decide [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6594.92s)]
*  when to pay, how to pay, condition alone, all possible state of the world. [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6599.88s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6605.16s)]
*  financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6613.32s)]
*  But let me conclude. [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6618.5199999999995s)]
*  This is not an easy road, it's a bumpy road and many things can go wrong. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6619.88s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way because we can end up in new [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6624.92s)]
*  fragmentation, we could end up in a system where competition is low, and we [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6631.24s)]
*  could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for a [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6637.16s)]
*  long time. So we need something that avoids [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6642.92s)]
*  fragmentation, increase competition and make sure that innovation state had even [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6646.76s)]
*  at the infrastructure level. Let me stop here. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6652.92s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of ambition [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6657.16s)]
*  on this panel. I think Piero really aims at the broad [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6663.24s)]
*  financial market integration. From the nun we heard a really very [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6672.2s)]
*  foundational innovation around finance. So, Michel, turning back to you, how do [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6679.400000000001s)]
*  you see the role of central banks in all of this? Money, of course, is the [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6688.04s)]
*  foundation of the financial system. Central banks have a clear mandate. [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6694.76s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6701.8s)]
*  underpinning, to innovation and, as you already alluded to, to this tight [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6709.96s)]
*  interconnection with the private sector? Thanks, Tobias. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6717.400000000001s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. One of our own strategic priorities at [[01:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6722.92s)]
*  the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6727.96s)]
*  I don't mean dictate the future of money. I don't mean mandate the future of money. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6731.64s)]
*  But I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6736.52s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the [[01:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6740.36s)]
*  payment system. We issue bank notes. We're all operating [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6743.8s)]
*  RTGS systems. In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6748.2s)]
*  infrastructures, which are a very important potential use case for [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6754.04s)]
*  tokenisation. So, against all that, I think it's [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6758.76s)]
*  incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this and work with the [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6761.56s)]
*  commercial sector. We need to be working with them, I think. [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6766.6s)]
*  So, it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6769.88s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. And I think what central banks can bring, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6773.64s)]
*  and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, is the role of leadership in [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6779.4s)]
*  terms of what's in public policy's interests as well. Because these things [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6786.44s)]
*  are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all the [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6793.08s)]
*  reasons we've spoken about. So, there is a very big public policy [[01:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6797.88s)]
*  interest in this as well. And I think that's what central banks can bring to [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6801.4s)]
*  this. So, in our own thinking about this, some [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6804.76s)]
*  of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6808.6s)]
*  exercises are, for example, how will this innovation promote or be consistent with [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6812.280000000001s)]
*  monetary and financial stability? Because that's obviously important to us. [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6818.84s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes, [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6822.84s)]
*  and how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6829.5599999999995s)]
*  markets? So, I think these are really important [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6834.599999999999s)]
*  questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6836.44s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6840.2s)]
*  think we'll be completely behind the curve. And we might end up with [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6846.2s)]
*  circumstances which aren't ideal. So, for example, at the moment, we've [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6849.639999999999s)]
*  already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6855.32s)]
*  safest way to do it. It's not the only way, but it is. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6858.68s)]
*  And a lot of our high value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6863.0s)]
*  money. So, if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6868.04s)]
*  might be, you might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it. And [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6877.96s)]
*  that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6883.719999999999s)]
*  So, again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6889.879999999999s)]
*  what to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6894.839999999999s)]
*  central bank money might be used in these circumstances, and what the policy [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6898.44s)]
*  implications might be of that. And there's another point here I think is [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6905.5599999999995s)]
*  worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, for example, prudential [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6912.12s)]
*  regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also potentially [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6915.88s)]
*  interested in all these issues as well. So, we need to be thinking about who [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6921.48s)]
*  we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. Ultimately, these sorts of [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6925.72s)]
*  things are networks. And they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6929.96s)]
*  them work. So, that's how I see our role. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6937.16s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michel. And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6941.32s)]
*  ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. Of course, Michel [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6949.96s)]
*  mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance and [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6958.2s)]
*  legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. So, how do you [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6969.5599999999995s)]
*  see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, but also [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6976.2s)]
*  emerging markets and developing economies? [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6982.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6986.44s)]
*  internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, nationally. Now, [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6990.44s)]
*  the main coordination has to be between authorities. I think central banks should [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=6996.68s)]
*  play a leading role. But also, how to engage with the private sector. Most of [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7001.320000000001s)]
*  the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be [[01:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7007.64s)]
*  the private sector. Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7012.52s)]
*  steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. What [[01:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7021.080000000001s)]
*  we see in technology is that there are very big players, they tend to dominate [[01:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7026.2s)]
*  the game, and we can end up with walled gardens, where you have fragmentation and [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7032.76s)]
*  you don't have a lot of integration. So, we need to exploit the energy, the [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7039.16s)]
*  knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in a way that brings together [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7044.44s)]
*  an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. The other important [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7049.8s)]
*  part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make the system grow out [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7055.8s)]
*  of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7063.16s)]
*  Pieroculti is old fashioned. I don't think it's old fashioned. I think it's [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7068.2s)]
*  essential is to have the trust that central bank brings in itself, which is [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7072.280000000001s)]
*  to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. I think precisely to preserve [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7079.16s)]
*  that element of trust is essential. So, given these two conditions, one that we [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7088.68s)]
*  need to sort of steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7093.72s)]
*  trust, how should the central banks behave? Again, let me emphasize, number one, we [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7099.96s)]
*  need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly what is the [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7108.76s)]
*  vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. We need to get [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7114.280000000001s)]
*  people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7122.04s)]
*  together. Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7127.16s)]
*  appropriate regulatory framework. This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around [[01:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7133.4s)]
*  issues like the status of tokenized assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7139.48s)]
*  smart contracts and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7146.28s)]
*  counterparts. We need to assure interoperability between, not only across [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7151.799999999999s)]
*  jurisdictions, but between traditional and new expressions of the financial system, [[01:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7159.16s)]
*  we need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. Third, I think that, again, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7165.5599999999995s)]
*  central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7173.88s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7180.84s)]
*  do today already. Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7186.6s)]
*  representation. So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7194.040000000001s)]
*  tokenized government bonds, and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. And [[02:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7202.4400000000005s)]
*  also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7210.6s)]
*  connect the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7219.56s)]
*  financial system. And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. I [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7226.280000000001s)]
*  think that is essential. I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7232.360000000001s)]
*  table. Most of it, I would say, is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7237.5599999999995s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7244.919999999999s)]
*  four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. In terms of coordination among [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7252.36s)]
*  central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. I mean, we are the bank of the [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7261.08s)]
*  central banks. The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7266.36s)]
*  expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. I mean, we [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7272.92s)]
*  don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7279.0s)]
*  expression of interest. So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7284.92s)]
*  an expression of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes to this [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7290.76s)]
*  subject. So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. And I [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7299.64s)]
*  think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7308.28s)]
*  development and so on, can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7317.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. And so one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so, Nandan, [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7326.28s)]
*  so how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? And more specifically, [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7338.44s)]
*  on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments and privacy, which is foundational for [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7347.4s)]
*  money. But on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. So how [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7358.679999999999s)]
*  do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7366.44s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7371.5599999999995s)]
*  public sector in framing the rules of the game, in the regulations that will govern [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7376.599999999999s)]
*  the tokenization. And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7382.44s)]
*  then market players will innovate and create solutions. And the third leg of that is [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7389.24s)]
*  technology because tokenization technology needs to be demystified and made available [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7395.64s)]
*  in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating internet labs across [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7402.200000000001s)]
*  the world, the US, Europe, India and Singapore, and building the composable building blocks [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7407.8s)]
*  to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization in the real [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7415.16s)]
*  world. And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7421.0s)]
*  we can actually see significant progress. And it's really up to the people in this room [[02:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7426.28s)]
*  to drive this because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value for [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7431.56s)]
*  inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress that we have to make every effort [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7437.88s)]
*  to expedite that. And we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7443.72s)]
*  journey of internet. So please, we are welcome. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7448.36s)]
*  Okay. Thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating panel. I think there are [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7453.639999999999s)]
*  many topics to explore. Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7458.36s)]
*  in the international community. This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7464.5199999999995s)]
*  Bank meetings in official capacity, but we are all looking forward to working with you [[02:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7471.799999999999s)]
*  in your next chapter. Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7476.28s)]
*  in this very important topic. Thank you. [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7484.84s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7491.64s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7497.96s)]
*  improving the current situation of financial market essentially because DLT and tokenization [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7504.84s)]
*  allow a different representation of asset in a digital form and this allow many new [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7513.0s)]
*  developments and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7520.76s)]
*  And we also observed that the Europeans and the Europe banks are pretty active on this [[02:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7525.96s)]
*  field, in this space. From our contact with the market, we see that 60% of the banks are [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7532.84s)]
*  interested in experimenting with DLT and actually something like 22% of them have already [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7540.68s)]
*  put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. Also on the security sides, we have seen a [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7547.88s)]
*  growing interest in issuing that. We have also the European level of specific [[02:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7559.88s)]
*  legislation that allows that so this might have improved the conditions so that bank [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7565.8s)]
*  ventures more easily into this. So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, [[02:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7575.24s)]
*  we think that we need to be in this space very early on for two fundamental reasons. [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7584.5199999999995s)]
*  The one reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else will [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7590.04s)]
*  be there. We don't have anything against commercial bank money but certainly we have to [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7595.32s)]
*  recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk which [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7601.719999999999s)]
*  is near and into commercial bank money so that we need to be there immediately as a [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7607.08s)]
*  central bank money. And the second reason is that market is [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7613.5599999999995s)]
*  asking us to be there. From our contact with the market, we are [[02:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7617.16s)]
*  encouraged to offer central bank money because market participants say that this is [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7621.719999999999s)]
*  essential for the market to develop. So, with this situation in mind, last year [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7627.4s)]
*  from May to September, well from November, we launched an experiment, a work on allowing [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7635.4s)]
*  experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment and have transaction on DLT [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7645.88s)]
*  could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7653.5599999999995s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the [[02:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7658.5199999999995s)]
*  asset transaction on DLT with our target services which is our traditional system. [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7666.5199999999995s)]
*  The three central bank of the Euro system, they invented a very interesting solution [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7675.96s)]
*  so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7682.28s)]
*  money in the RTGS basically. The experiment had been a big success. [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7687.88s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance so a growing [[02:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7693.64s)]
*  interest more than what we were expecting. So the question is what do we do from there? [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7701.64s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7706.68s)]
*  production and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7713.4s)]
*  allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7720.44s)]
*  central bank money. Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT on the same [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7726.599999999999s)]
*  DLT where the assets are. This is for the short term. [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7733.16s)]
*  However, we are talking also thinking about what to do in the long term and here we are open to a [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7738.04s)]
*  much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have on [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7744.120000000001s)]
*  the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. [[02:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7752.76s)]
*  BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7757.56s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers which [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7763.0s)]
*  could take care of, you know, could specialize from different use case or adapt to specific [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7770.76s)]
*  condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7777.400000000001s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. More to come. [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7788.28s)]
*  Great. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7791.5599999999995s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7793.0s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7800.12s)]
*  interchangeable to first order approximation. So, you know, it is there are some minor [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7808.839999999999s)]
*  differences but, you know, DLT tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. [[02:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7818.04s)]
*  So, Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[02:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7824.76s)]
*  its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of working [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7833.56s)]
*  with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7842.76s)]
*  the world and you have been particularly working on tokenization, you know, with central bank but [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7851.72s)]
*  also with commercial banks and with technology firms. So where are you, you know, having done [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7857.72s)]
*  this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7864.6s)]
*  to the financial system and so like the future of tokenization and finance? [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7870.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Tobias. It's great to be in this panel with two very [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7878.12s)]
*  distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur, [[02:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7883.24s)]
*  thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality and I think that's why [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7890.5199999999995s)]
*  it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us and of course I would say Tobias is [[02:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7897.48s)]
*  an honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always very strong [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7902.44s)]
*  contributions in that respect. Now, tokenization, first it's great that it has become a topic [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7908.759999999999s)]
*  under which we can have a discussion like this. And tokenization in terms of its [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7918.28s)]
*  applicability to financial transactions. I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7924.12s)]
*  our financial transactions and the financial systems in general. I would say at least in two [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7934.28s)]
*  directions they can make very important contribution. First, it certainly can improve the way the [[02:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7941.88s)]
*  financial system works today. Where most developments have happened and most attention has [[02:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7947.96s)]
*  been paid off is with payments and well obviously currencies but those are the most elementary type [[02:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7956.92s)]
*  of transactions. Now today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7963.64s)]
*  tremendously complex, tremendously cumbersome and it certainly would be good to make them far simpler [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7970.36s)]
*  and that's something that tokenization can achieve. Today for example when you do a payment, [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7980.679999999999s)]
*  usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation and settlement. Given that [[02:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7987.32s)]
*  separation many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost especially on KYC, AML CFD. If you integrate [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=7993.56s)]
*  everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured and this can be applied not only for [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8002.360000000001s)]
*  payments but for many other financial transactions. In that sense tokenization also allows something [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8010.76s)]
*  that we can call programmability which is to put everything, all the instructions, all the [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8018.2s)]
*  procedures, regulation and so on in a contained chip I would say that would allow the execution of [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8027.96s)]
*  very complex transactions to the point that many of them for example we don't do today. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8039.4s)]
*  I mean traditionally if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, the development [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8047.16s)]
*  of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we don't [[02:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8055.08s)]
*  have a way to put them together and put them into play. Tokenization definitely could facilitate [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8061.4s)]
*  and therefore tokenization can really be the future of a financial system with the [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8069.8s)]
*  sophistication that today we cannot imagine. Another very attractive aspect of tokenization [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8076.599999999999s)]
*  and of technological development is the fact that it would allow many countries to leapfrog [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8083.639999999999s)]
*  from where they are today. India for example is a great example and through one of the [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8093.8s)]
*  contributions that Nanda made happen which is the identity of people and to be able to map [[02:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8101.0s)]
*  accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. Really what you can do is to leapfrog from being [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8108.6s)]
*  very backward, very unsophisticated to something where you really can achieve the financial system [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8117.88s)]
*  contribute to the well-being of the different nations. The contribution of this for inclusion [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8125.24s)]
*  is very, very significant and that's why we are supporting this fully at the BIS. Now one can ask [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8135.400000000001s)]
*  make the following question why the take-off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization and I think [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8145.0s)]
*  part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts but those efforts are isolated. We have not [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8153.08s)]
*  been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. We have tried it [[02:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8163.08s)]
*  through the internet here in London. We'll speak later. I also will speak later about it. I really [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8171.08s)]
*  welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCB you're trying to integrate [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8177.5599999999995s)]
*  central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets and to have a joint vision to promote [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8185.48s)]
*  these. If we have this vision that could allow a coordination devices and we can go from individual [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8193.16s)]
*  innovations and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. In a way that's what [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8202.6s)]
*  we're trying to do at the BIS Innovation Hub. We also have started with very specific projects. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8212.92s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together and [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8221.8s)]
*  how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation and make the system [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8228.04s)]
*  work as a whole. In terms of the, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8234.44s)]
*  two. For example, one is Agora, which is a first effort, major effort, where we're working with 40 [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8242.6s)]
*  commercial banks, seven central banks to really streamline dramatically cross border payments. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8251.640000000001s)]
*  This works based on technization. The enthusiasm is great and this could be a major platform to [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8258.36s)]
*  really make a cross border payments extremely efficient. Again, this could be the infrastructure [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8267.64s)]
*  we're creating can be part of broader developments. The other is Project Pine. Project Pine basically [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8275.08s)]
*  uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important for a financial system of the future [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8283.88s)]
*  to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way that Michelle expressed, commercial bank [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8292.52s)]
*  digital money and government securities in tokenized fashion. Here the idea on the Project Pine is how [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8301.560000000001s)]
*  can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. Even for those [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8310.92s)]
*  purposes the tokenization effort could be great. I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8318.6s)]
*  of using tokenization to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. Today, again, [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8326.44s)]
*  it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. A lot of progress has been made, but at some point [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8336.68s)]
*  we need to achieve, for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. Many years ago, [[02:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8343.0s)]
*  like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. You would have to access internet through [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8351.48s)]
*  a different device. You would have a different phone. You would have your camera. It would be [[02:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8358.44s)]
*  tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. Today you can do it immediately [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8364.2s)]
*  because everything is integrated. If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8370.76s)]
*  making a huge breakthrough. The important thing is that technology is there. The technology is not [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8377.48s)]
*  the limiting factors. What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8384.84s)]
*  the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. I can comment [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8395.96s)]
*  more about that later, but in any case I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8402.119999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustin. It's really the interplay between innovation which may [[02:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8410.359999999999s)]
*  go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8419.72s)]
*  that that is the current juncture in many aspects. So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustin on this [[02:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8428.76s)]
*  concept that you labeled the Finternet. A kind of global payment system that is just as seamless [[02:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8443.08s)]
*  as the internet. I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet [[02:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8455.16s)]
*  existing and nowadays it is everywhere. I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8462.12s)]
*  financial payments and financial services we could have such a seamless object. So explain a little [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8468.68s)]
*  bit more your thinking around that and particularly this intersection between the public and the [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8478.36s)]
*  private sector in that regard. Thank you. I think technology has been integral to financial [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8484.36s)]
*  services for several decades and we have seen that whether it's in banking, the branch, you [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8493.8s)]
*  now go to a mobile phone app, payments are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a [[02:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8499.56s)]
*  mutual fund on a phone. So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8506.599999999999s)]
*  technology to financial services. But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8513.32s)]
*  purpose specific infrastructure with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8519.56s)]
*  and clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. And I think why we are excited [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8525.64s)]
*  by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things, [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8531.72s)]
*  it's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, portable and interoperable [[02:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8539.16s)]
*  from day one. That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. And this is where the idea of the [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8546.84s)]
*  internet came in. The thing is that they have a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[02:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8553.48s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. Countries are talking about stable coins. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8561.48s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. So we're seeing a lot of work happening. But if we [[02:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8567.48s)]
*  really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8573.4s)]
*  new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. And the idea of the internet came [[02:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8579.32s)]
*  about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023 and he had been [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8585.64s)]
*  writing about the internet, writing about this new financial architecture and my colleagues and I [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8593.64s)]
*  and Ramod, Siddharth and myself had been working on population scale systems with billions of users [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8601.0s)]
*  and billions of transactions over the last several years. So we got together and said, can we apply [[02:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8607.8s)]
*  that population scale generic approach to tokenization? And that's how was born the idea of [[02:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8613.56s)]
*  the internet. And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 and actually [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8621.32s)]
*  published the paper only in April of 24. Now what we're trying to do is come out with a road map [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8628.12s)]
*  on how we can tokenize assets across the world. So basically there are three important ways we look at it. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8636.84s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user centric. It's not about institutions. It's about putting the power [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8646.6s)]
*  of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8655.64s)]
*  So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in the internet. The second is it should be a unified [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8664.12s)]
*  architecture for all types of assets. In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8672.44s)]
*  property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, they should all be able to work with the same [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8680.039999999999s)]
*  infrastructure. So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8685.88s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, but to create a universal [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8693.08s)]
*  infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. And it should be able to be used [[02:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8699.08s)]
*  anywhere. And we felt that if we put this point of view across, then we're at least creating a [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8704.84s)]
*  vision of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. Now it's exactly a [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8710.52s)]
*  year since we released this paper. It was April of 24, and a lot has happened since then. We find that [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8718.92s)]
*  the technology is actually quite mature enough. We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8726.76s)]
*  more mature. Then second is that all of the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8731.72s)]
*  framework for having tokenized assets. And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. And as [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8738.279999999999s)]
*  Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. So that's where we [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8746.199999999999s)]
*  have been working in the last one year. We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8752.599999999999s)]
*  internet would look like, how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. We have a universal [[02:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8759.48s)]
*  information tokenized system, and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8766.279999999999s)]
*  billions of transaction level using public chain technology. But we're not wedded to any [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8773.72s)]
*  technology. It's agnostic to which technology that we use. And pilots are underway today, both with [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8779.72s)]
*  central bankers and with companies. And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of, [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8786.12s)]
*  by December of this year, we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8792.92s)]
*  And these are multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. So I think we believe that the [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8799.400000000001s)]
*  time has come to really implement the internet approach. And if we can work with making it [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8808.12s)]
*  user-centric, universal and unified, we're really going to create a financial network that works for [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8815.880000000001s)]
*  everyone everywhere. And it's really a question of moving it now. I think we can demonstrate in the [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8822.84s)]
*  next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. Technology will be available. [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8830.36s)]
*  It will be available as open source. Any country, any company can use it. It's really about applying [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8835.88s)]
*  it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. So that's where we are after one [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8841.72s)]
*  year. And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8846.84s)]
*  faster. Great. Thanks so much for that insight. Let me turn back to Piero. And, you know, [[02:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8853.64s)]
*  ask about the broader capital market implications. I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8866.039999999999s)]
*  that and Michelle as well. So how do you see sort of like, you know, how what central banks are doing [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8875.64s)]
*  on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments, you know, that are, [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8886.36s)]
*  you know, oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8892.92s)]
*  So, you know, this question is particularly interesting for the European market. You know, [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8902.68s)]
*  we come from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. I don't even remember how [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8910.44s)]
*  many trading venues we have. I think we are in the order of 41. We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8916.76s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market, you know, in this condition. Fragmentation is a high cost. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8926.12s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a [[02:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8935.320000000002s)]
*  problem. So we see our effort in terms of developing, you know, a unified ledger or some [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8941.08s)]
*  new platform based on tokenization as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, [[02:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8951.88s)]
*  at least the backbone of a financial capital, unified financial capital market in Europe. [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8959.48s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension, right? The potential, [[02:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8965.48s)]
*  the transformational potential of DLT, I think, can be clustered in two groups. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8972.36s)]
*  As Augustine was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8977.960000000001s)]
*  efficient way. And those are the low-hanging fruit. And then there is another dimension. [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8984.28s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=8990.679999999998s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? Just to give you some example, DLT would [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9000.599999999999s)]
*  allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. So basically, we could have a unified, you know, platform [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9008.599999999999s)]
*  working around the clock all year long. Second, if you think today the three key [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9018.6s)]
*  functions of trading is, you know, the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody [[02:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9025.720000000001s)]
*  are done on three different platforms. You know, we could bring on the DLT on the same platform, [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9030.52s)]
*  the three functions. This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9037.4s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, right? Through [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9045.4s)]
*  digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. So all this, at the end [[02:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9050.84s)]
*  of the day, would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. But the key difference will be [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9058.28s)]
*  the thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new services. And to me, everything boils [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9066.84s)]
*  down to one single concept. Digitalization changes the nature of money. Money is not any longer a [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9074.2s)]
*  scriptural, it's a file. A very sophisticated file, but it's a file. So on a file, you can put all the [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9082.28s)]
*  conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, how to pay, conditional on all possible [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9089.88s)]
*  states of the world. So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9096.839999999998s)]
*  the financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. But let me conclude. This is not [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9104.92s)]
*  an easy road. It's a bumpy road. And many things can go wrong. So we need to do it in a very [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9114.199999999999s)]
*  attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. We could end up in a system where [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9120.279999999999s)]
*  competition is low, and we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9127.32s)]
*  technology for a long time. So we need something that avoids fragmentation, something that [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9134.679999999998s)]
*  increases competition, and makes sure that innovation states are even at the infrastructure level. [[02:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9141.64s)]
*  Let me stop here. Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9150.599999999999s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. From the nun we heard [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9160.92s)]
*  really a very foundational innovation around finance. So, Michel, turning back to you, [[02:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9173.720000000001s)]
*  how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? Money, of course, is the foundation of [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9183.72s)]
*  the financial system. Central banks have a clear mandate. How can central banks help in this [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9192.039999999999s)]
*  broader transition to a new technological underpinning, to innovation? And as you [[02:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9201.56s)]
*  already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector. Thanks, Tobias. [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9210.28s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve [[02:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9219.08s)]
*  Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. Now, I don't mean dictate the future of [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9224.6s)]
*  money. I don't mean mandate the future of money. But I think helping to determine the future of [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9229.560000000001s)]
*  money is really important. From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9234.92s)]
*  payment system. We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems. In our own case, we're [[02:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9239.96s)]
*  also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are a very important potential [[02:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9247.4s)]
*  use case for tokenisation. So, against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9254.039999999999s)]
*  banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. We need to be working with [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9258.919999999998s)]
*  them, I think. So, it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. I think [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9265.4s)]
*  it's a partnership role as well. And I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9270.039999999999s)]
*  of ourselves of bringing, is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public, what's in public [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9276.68s)]
*  policies interests as well. Because these things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9285.8s)]
*  to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. So, there is a very big public policy [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9292.84s)]
*  interest in this and well, I think that's what central banks can bring to this. So, in our own [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9297.56s)]
*  thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9303.56s)]
*  are, for example, how will this innovation promote and be or be consistent with monetary and financial [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9309.32s)]
*  stability? Because that's obviously important to us. What sort of issues are there for the [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9316.2s)]
*  tokenisation of potential asset classes and how will they promote safety and resilience as well [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9322.52s)]
*  as efficiency of markets? So, I think these are really important questions and central banks bring [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9329.800000000001s)]
*  that perspective to it. I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9334.92s)]
*  I think we'll be completely behind the curve and we might end up with circumstances which aren't [[02:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9342.2s)]
*  ideal. So, for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9347.320000000002s)]
*  central bank money is the safest way to do it. It's not the only way, but it is and a lot of [[02:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9353.640000000001s)]
*  our high value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. So, if we don't engage with [[02:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9360.2s)]
*  this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you might pair with payments, then we [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9369.56s)]
*  might get left out of it and that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9378.359999999999s)]
*  risk. So, again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what to do, [[02:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9384.84s)]
*  but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money might be used in [[02:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9391.48s)]
*  these circumstances and what the policy implications might be of that. And there's [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9399.08s)]
*  another point here I think is worth making is that other regulatory authorities, for example, [[02:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9407.24s)]
*  prudential regulators, consumer regulators and the government are also potentially interested in all [[02:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9411.56s)]
*  these issues as well. So, we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9418.36s)]
*  our stakeholders. Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks and they need lots of [[02:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9423.8s)]
*  stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. So, that's how I see our role. [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9430.599999999999s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9437.64s)]
*  the coordination, cooperation across countries. Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9447.4s)]
*  but they're also broader issues around governance and legal certainty, which are extremely important [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9457.48s)]
*  across countries. So, how do you see that playing out across countries and not just [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9469.72s)]
*  advanced economies, but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9477.32s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, [[02:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9482.679999999998s)]
*  I would say at the beginning, nationally. Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9489.24s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role, but also how to engage with the private sector. [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9496.12s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9503.240000000002s)]
*  private sector. Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9508.92s)]
*  participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. What we see in technology is [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9517.880000000001s)]
*  that there are very big players. They tend to dominate the game, and we can end up with world [[02:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9524.84s)]
*  gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. So, we need to exploit [[02:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9532.36s)]
*  the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in a way that brings together [[02:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9539.56s)]
*  an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. The other important part, [[02:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9545.960000000001s)]
*  the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9552.28s)]
*  we have in today's traditional banking system. Pieroculti is old-fashioned. I don't think it's [[02:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9560.84s)]
*  old-fashioned. I think it's essential to have the trust that central bank brings in itself, [[02:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9566.92s)]
*  which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. I think precisely [[02:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9574.6s)]
*  to preserve that element of trust is essential. So, given these two conditions, one that we need to [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9584.2s)]
*  sort of steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9590.28s)]
*  central banks behave? Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly [[02:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9597.72s)]
*  and articulate more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9607.4s)]
*  joint experimentation. We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9614.84s)]
*  bring that picture together. Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9622.279999999999s)]
*  appropriate regulatory framework. This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the [[02:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9629.64s)]
*  status of tokenized assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts, and the [[02:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9637.0s)]
*  relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. We need to assure [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9643.64s)]
*  interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, but between traditional and [[02:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9651.16s)]
*  new expressions of the financial system. We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9658.52s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9667.16s)]
*  assets and platforms. This is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask [[02:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9675.24s)]
*  of what we do today already. Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9682.28s)]
*  technological representation. Here, I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits, [[02:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9689.32s)]
*  and tokenized government bonds, and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9698.44s)]
*  Also, we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to connect [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9706.84s)]
*  the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9716.2s)]
*  Fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. I think that is essential. I think [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9724.599999999999s)]
*  there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. Most of it, I would say, is there, [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9730.359999999999s)]
*  but we need to find ways to coordinate this. I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9736.92s)]
*  will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals, and it would facilitate [[02:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9745.0s)]
*  to get where we want. In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the [[02:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9751.64s)]
*  BIS is there for. We are the bank of the central banks. The fact that the BIS has been [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9758.6s)]
*  doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9766.92s)]
*  subject matter. We don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9772.76s)]
*  to the expression of interest. What we have done through the hope is more than anything of an [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9780.76s)]
*  expression of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9787.16s)]
*  In any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. I think the IMF, [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9798.12s)]
*  through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development, and so on, [[02:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9805.8s)]
*  can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9815.48s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. One of the things you pointed to is AML-CFT. [[02:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9823.4s)]
*  So, how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? More specifically, [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9834.119999999999s)]
*  on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments and privacy, which is foundational for money, [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9844.039999999999s)]
*  but on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, AML-CFT compliance. How do you think [[02:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9855.24s)]
*  about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? Well, I think like everything [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9863.0s)]
*  else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9868.92s)]
*  of the game, in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. Once those rules are well defined [[02:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9875.32s)]
*  and the playing field is defined, then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9883.72s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9889.56s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9897.32s)]
*  internet labs across the world, the US, Europe, India, and Singapore, and building the [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9902.2s)]
*  composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9909.64s)]
*  tokenization in the real world. And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts [[02:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9915.56s)]
*  and minds on it, we can actually see significant progress. And it's really up to the people in this [[02:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9921.48s)]
*  room to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value for [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9926.92s)]
*  inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress, that we have to make every effort to [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9934.119999999999s)]
*  expedite that. And we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the internet [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9940.039999999999s)]
*  journey. So please, we are welcome. Okay, thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9945.16s)]
*  panel. I think there are many topics to explore. Let me again thank Augustin particularly for his [[02:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9953.16s)]
*  long service in the international community. This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World [[02:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9959.88s)]
*  Bank meetings in official capacity, but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9967.96s)]
*  chapter. Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this very important [[02:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9975.32s)]
*  topic. Thank you. And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9982.36s)]
*  is a growing interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role [[02:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=9993.32s)]
*  in improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[02:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10001.0s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new developments, [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10009.56s)]
*  and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. We also observed that the Europeans and [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10017.8s)]
*  in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, in this space. From our contact with the market, [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10026.759999999998s)]
*  we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT, and actually something [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10034.039999999999s)]
*  like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. Also on [[02:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10041.48s)]
*  the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. We have also the European level [[02:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10053.96s)]
*  of specific legislation that allows that, so this might have improved the conditions so that banks [[02:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10061.32s)]
*  venture more easily into this. So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to [[02:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10072.039999999999s)]
*  be in this space very early on for two fundamental reasons. One reason is the fact that if we are not [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10082.2s)]
*  there with central bank money, somebody else will be there. We don't have anything against [[02:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10088.68s)]
*  commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10094.52s)]
*  of the system and credit risk, which is near and into commercial bank money, so that we need to be [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10100.84s)]
*  there immediately as a central bank money. The second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[02:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10107.96s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[02:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10115.08s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. So, with this situation in mind, [[02:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10121.08s)]
*  last year from May to September, well from November, we launched an experiment, [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10130.76s)]
*  a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment [[02:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10140.04s)]
*  and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10146.28s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10154.52s)]
*  coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional [[02:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10161.16s)]
*  system. The three central banks of the euro system, they invented a very interesting solution so that [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10171.32s)]
*  you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank money in the RTGS. [[02:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10179.64s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, [[02:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10187.32s)]
*  big issuance, so a growing interest, more than what we were expecting. [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10195.64s)]
*  The question is what do we do from there? We want to continue and get into production, [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10200.36s)]
*  move from the experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise soon a solution [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10206.12s)]
*  in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in expanding their [[02:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10213.08s)]
*  business on DLT while providing for us central bank money. Again, we are not at this stage putting [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10219.320000000002s)]
*  money on the DLT on the same DLT where the assets are. This is for the short term. However, we are [[02:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10226.84s)]
*  thinking about what to do in the long term. Here we are open to a much more possible [[02:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10235.64s)]
*  integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have on the same platform [[02:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10241.64s)]
*  central bank money, commercial bank money assets. BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10249.880000000001s)]
*  this and this is a possibility. An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10256.92s)]
*  fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of the special life of different use case [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10263.56s)]
*  or adapt to specific conditions or even allow for a better transition from the traditional [[02:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10271.4s)]
*  RTGS to this new solution. So the news is stay tuned. More to come. [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10280.519999999999s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much, Piero. Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[02:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10287.8s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly [[02:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10296.76s)]
*  interchangeable to a first order approximation. There are some minor differences but DLT [[02:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10304.84s)]
*  tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for [[02:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10316.84s)]
*  International Settlement in Basel has been very active through its innovation hub in particular [[02:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10324.6s)]
*  but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of working with central banks [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10332.36s)]
*  to explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world. [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10341.24s)]
*  You have been particularly working on tokenization with central banks but also with commercial banks [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10349.16s)]
*  and with technology firms. So where are you having done this for a number of years now? [[02:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10355.560000000001s)]
*  Where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10362.52s)]
*  and the future of tokenization and finance? Well, thank you very much, Tobias. It's great [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10368.599999999999s)]
*  to be in this panel. We are two very distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero and a tremendously [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10377.08s)]
*  dynamic entrepreneur, thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[02:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10384.359999999999s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10392.919999999998s)]
*  And of course, I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because [[02:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10396.76s)]
*  he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. Now, tokenization, first is great that [[02:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10402.36s)]
*  it has become a topic under which we can have a discussion like this. And tokenization in terms [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10411.800000000001s)]
*  of its applicability to financial transactions. I think tokenization has a huge potential to [[02:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10419.96s)]
*  contribute to our financial transactions and the financial systems in general. I would say at least [[02:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10429.72s)]
*  in two directions they can make very important contribution. First, it certainly can improve the [[02:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10437.08s)]
*  way the financial system works today. Where most developments have happened and most attention [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10443.8s)]
*  has been paid off is with payments and, well, obviously currencies. But those are the most [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10452.84s)]
*  elementary type of transactions. Now, today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10458.759999999998s)]
*  is tremendously complex, tremendously cumbersome. And it certainly would be good to make them far [[02:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10466.439999999999s)]
*  simpler. And that's something that tokenization can achieve. Today, for example, when you do a [[02:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10475.88s)]
*  payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation, and settlement. Given [[02:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10482.519999999999s)]
*  that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially on KYC, [[02:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10488.68s)]
*  AML, CFD. If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured. And this can be [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10496.2s)]
*  applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. In that sense, tokenization [[02:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10505.64s)]
*  also allows something that we can call programmability, which is to put everything, [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10513.48s)]
*  all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation, and so on, in a contained chip, [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10521.88s)]
*  that would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that many of them, [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10533.24s)]
*  for example, we don't do today. Traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10539.88s)]
*  many contingent, the development of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10547.8s)]
*  in its application because we don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10555.4s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this, and therefore, tokenization can really be the [[02:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10561.8s)]
*  future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. Another very [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10569.56s)]
*  attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10576.759999999998s)]
*  it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10585.4s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10592.68s)]
*  which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10599.4s)]
*  way. Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated, [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10608.92s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10616.68s)]
*  of the different nations. The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant, [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10623.32s)]
*  and that's why we are supporting this fully at the BIS. Now one can ask, make the following [[02:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10633.64s)]
*  question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization? And I think part of it [[02:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10642.199999999999s)]
*  is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts are isolated. We have not been [[02:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10650.359999999999s)]
*  fully able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. We have tried it through [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10659.72s)]
*  the internet here. Nanda will speak later. I also will speak later about it. I really welcome what [[02:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10667.64s)]
*  Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCB, you're trying to integrate [[02:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10674.519999999999s)]
*  central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, and to have a joint vision [[02:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10681.64s)]
*  to promote this. If we have this vision, that would allow coordination devices, and we can go [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10688.839999999998s)]
*  from individual innovations and making the parts, in a way, work together in a virtuous way. [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10697.72s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the BIS Innovation Hub. We also have started with very [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10708.359999999999s)]
*  specific projects. Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how [[02:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10715.48s)]
*  they can fit together and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10722.439999999999s)]
*  and make the system work as a whole. In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, [[02:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10729.72s)]
*  let me mention two. For example, one is AGORA, which is a first effort, major effort, where we're [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10737.08s)]
*  working with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks, to really streamline dramatically cross-border [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10746.68s)]
*  payments. This works based on tokenization. The enthusiasm is great, and this could be a major [[02:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10753.640000000001s)]
*  platform to really make cross-border payments extremely efficient. Again, this could be [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10762.68s)]
*  the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. The other is Project Pine. [[02:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10770.28s)]
*  Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important for a [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10778.36s)]
*  financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way that [[02:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10786.76s)]
*  Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money, and government securities in tokenized fashion. [[02:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10794.92s)]
*  Here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate [[03:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10805.16s)]
*  implementation of monetary policy. So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10811.4s)]
*  great. I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really [[03:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10817.88s)]
*  shift the boundaries of the financial system. Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult, [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10826.84s)]
*  to make transactions. A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to [[03:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10834.36s)]
*  achieve, for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. Many years ago, like 10 years ago, [[03:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10842.84s)]
*  you would have a messaging machine. You would have to access internet through a different device. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10848.68s)]
*  You would have a different phone. You would have your camera. It would be tremendously difficult [[03:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10856.04s)]
*  even to take a photograph and send it. Today you can do it immediately because everything is [[03:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10861.64s)]
*  integrated. If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[03:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10868.279999999999s)]
*  The important thing is that technology is there. The technology is not the limiting factors. What [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10876.359999999999s)]
*  we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, the provision of basic [[03:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10883.08s)]
*  infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. I can comment more about that later, [[03:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10893.48s)]
*  but in any case, I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[03:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10899.88s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10905.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustin. It's really the interplay between innovation, which may [[03:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10906.52s)]
*  go in different directions, and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around [[03:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10918.119999999999s)]
*  that. That is the current juncture in many aspects. Nandan, you have worked with Agustin [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10924.84s)]
*  on this concept that you labeled the Finternet, a kind of global payment system that is just as [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10938.04s)]
*  seamless as the Internet. I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10950.36s)]
*  existing, and nowadays it is everywhere. I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for [[03:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10958.2s)]
*  payments and financial services we could have such a seamless object. Explain a little bit more [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10964.84s)]
*  your thinking around that, and particularly this intersection between the public and the private [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10974.92s)]
*  sector in that regard. Thank you. I think technology has been integral to financial services [[03:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10980.6s)]
*  for several decades. We have seen that, whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile [[03:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10990.44s)]
*  phone app, payments are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=10997.4s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial [[03:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11004.119999999999s)]
*  services. But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose-specific infrastructure with [[03:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11010.84s)]
*  their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance. And clearly we have to think about [[03:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11017.88s)]
*  doing some things differently. And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11023.56s)]
*  it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation [[03:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11030.76s)]
*  where money and assets are programmable, portable, and interoperable from day one. [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11038.12s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. And this is where the idea of the Finternet came [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11044.12s)]
*  in. The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. Many [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11050.44s)]
*  central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. Countries are talking about stable [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11057.88s)]
*  coins. Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11063.16s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time [[03:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11069.0s)]
*  to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. And the idea of the [[03:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11074.279999999999s)]
*  Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11080.759999999998s)]
*  2023. And he had been writing about this new financial architecture. And my colleagues and I, [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11087.24s)]
*  Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population scale systems with billions of users [[03:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11097.0s)]
*  and billions of transactions over the last several years. So we got together and said, [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11103.88s)]
*  can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? And that's how was [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11108.68s)]
*  born the idea of the Finternet. And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February [[03:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11116.2s)]
*  23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24. Now what we are trying to do is come out [[03:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11123.0s)]
*  with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. So basically there are three [[03:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11131.400000000001s)]
*  important ways we look at it. One is we should design this to be user centric. It's not about [[03:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11140.92s)]
*  institutions. It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11148.28s)]
*  user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in [[03:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11154.44s)]
*  the Finternet. The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11163.72s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11172.279999999999s)]
*  bonds, they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. So this asset agnostic [[03:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11178.84s)]
*  approach is very important to create a unified approach. The third thing is that this is not for [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11185.32s)]
*  any purpose or geography, but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11191.72s)]
*  capable of doing this. And it should be able to be used anywhere. And we felt that if we put this [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11197.16s)]
*  point of view across, then at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be [[03:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11203.88s)]
*  done in a more systematic fashion. Now it's exactly a year since we released this paper. It was April [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11210.199999999999s)]
*  of 24. And a lot has happened since then. We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11217.8s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. Then second is that all of the world, [[03:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11225.88s)]
*  the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. And I [[03:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11231.24s)]
*  think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a [[03:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11238.679999999998s)]
*  background of actually getting things done. So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11244.6s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, how you do [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11251.48s)]
*  credentialing, how you create wallets. We have a universal information tokenized system. And we're [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11257.800000000001s)]
*  actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11264.84s)]
*  chain technology. But we're not ready to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11273.0s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. And we think over the [[03:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11279.24s)]
*  next year, next few months, by the end of by December of this year, we'll actually have enough [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11286.36s)]
*  working technology to show this working. And these are multiple areas, deposits and, you know, [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11291.72s)]
*  wallets, ledgers and so on. So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11300.039999999999s)]
*  the internet approach. And if we can work with making it user centric, universal and unified, [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11307.32s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11315.24s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. I think we can demonstrate in the next few months [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11320.76s)]
*  that technology is not going to be the challenge. Technology will be available. It will be available [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11327.08s)]
*  as open source. Any country, any company can use it. It's really about applying it in a regulatory [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11332.92s)]
*  framework for the kind of assets that we want. So that's where we are after one year. And we are [[03:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11338.92s)]
*  very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11344.76s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for that insight. Let me turn back to Piero and, you know, [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11350.2s)]
*  ask about the broader capital market implications. I think [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11362.36s)]
*  Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that and Michelle as well. So how do you see sort of like, [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11367.480000000001s)]
*  you know, how what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11378.279999999999s)]
*  market developments, you know, that are, you know, oftentimes beyond the normal operational [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11386.68s)]
*  reach of central banks? So, you know, this question is particularly interesting for the [[03:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11395.88s)]
*  European market. You know, we come from a situation where our markets are completely [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11404.2s)]
*  fragmented. I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. I think we are in the [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11409.720000000001s)]
*  order of 41. We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. It's hard to talk about capital market, [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11415.720000000001s)]
*  you know, in this condition. Fragmentation is a high cost. Access to finance is a problem. [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11425.64s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. So we see our effort [[03:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11433.880000000001s)]
*  in terms of developing, you know, a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11441.32s)]
*  as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a [[03:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11450.68s)]
*  financial capital, unified financial capital markets in Europe. And to simplify, I can simplify [[03:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11457.48s)]
*  by thinking to the dimension, right? The potential, the transformational potential of DLT, I think, [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11464.36s)]
*  can be clustered in two groups. As Augustine was saying, we can think of things that we already do [[03:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11471.720000000001s)]
*  and we can do it in a more efficient way. And those are the low-hanging fruit. And then there [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11478.76s)]
*  is another dimension. What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11484.92s)]
*  the way we treat money? Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? Just to give you some [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11494.36s)]
*  example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. So basically, we could have a unified [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11503.08s)]
*  platform working around the clock all year long. Second, if you think today the three key function [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11513.96s)]
*  of the trading is, you know, the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody are done on the three [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11522.44s)]
*  different platforms. You know, we could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11527.88s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. Third, if you think the effort [[03:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11534.759999999998s)]
*  we are making to move to T plus something, right? Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move [[03:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11543.56s)]
*  to T plus zero immediately. So all this, at the end of the day, would reduce costs and make it a [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11550.2s)]
*  more efficient market. But the key difference will be the thinking about DLT as a nibbler, [[03:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11559.0s)]
*  as has been said, for new services. And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11568.52s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. Money is not any longer a scriptural, it is a file, [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11575.88s)]
*  a very sophisticated file, but it's a file. So on a file, you can put all the conditions you want, [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11583.8s)]
*  and so you can decide when to pay, how to pay, condition alone, all possible state of the world. [[03:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11590.6s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11597.4s)]
*  and the financial sector to a different stage. But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11607.96s)]
*  It's a bumpy road, and many things can go wrong. So we need to do it in a very [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11613.56s)]
*  attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. We could end up in a system [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11620.92s)]
*  where competition is low, and we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11626.68s)]
*  with the new technology for a long time. So we need something that avoids fragmentation, [[03:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11633.48s)]
*  increases competition, and makes sure that innovation stays hard even at the infrastructure [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11639.960000000001s)]
*  level. Let me stop here. Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11646.28s)]
*  ambition on this panel. I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11654.759999999998s)]
*  From the nun we heard, a very foundational innovation around finance. So Michelle, [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11667.16s)]
*  turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[03:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11678.92s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. Central banks have a clear mandate. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11685.720000000001s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11694.2s)]
*  to innovation, and as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector? [[03:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11703.48s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. I think central banks do have a role. One of our own strategic priorities at the [[03:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11712.68s)]
*  Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. I don't mean dictate the future [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11720.52s)]
*  of money. I don't mean mandate the future of money, but I think helping to determine the future of [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11725.72s)]
*  money is really important. From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, [[03:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11731.24s)]
*  we are all in the payment system. We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems. [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11735.32s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11742.44s)]
*  a very important potential use case for tokenisation. So against all that, I think it's incumbent upon [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11747.8s)]
*  central banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. We need to be [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11754.84s)]
*  working with them, I think. So it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11761.08s)]
*  than that. I think it's a partnership role as well. And I think what central banks can bring, [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11765.72s)]
*  and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, is the role of leadership in terms of what's in [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11771.880000000001s)]
*  the public, what's in public policy's interests as well. Because these things are, yes, it's [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11779.8s)]
*  commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11786.84s)]
*  So there is a very big public policy interest in this as well. And I think that's what central [[03:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11791.48s)]
*  banks can bring to this. So in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11796.359999999999s)]
*  ourselves as we go through these exercises are, for example, how will this innovation promote [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11803.16s)]
*  or be consistent with monetary and financial stability? Because that's obviously important to [[03:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11809.96s)]
*  us. What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes? And how will [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11814.92s)]
*  they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? So I think these are really [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11822.439999999999s)]
*  important questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. I also think that if central [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11828.439999999999s)]
*  banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I think we'll be completely behind the curve, [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11835.64s)]
*  and we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. So for example, at the moment, [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11841.0s)]
*  we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11847.48s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is. And all our high value systems at the moment, they settle in [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11853.56s)]
*  central bank money. So if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11859.8s)]
*  you might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it. And that might not have good [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11871.72s)]
*  results for financial stability and settlement risk. So again, we think we're not going to drive [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11877.24s)]
*  this. We're not going to tell people what to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11885.88s)]
*  it, how central bank money might be used in these circumstances, and what the policy implications [[03:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11890.039999999999s)]
*  might be of that. And there's another point here I think is worth making, is that other regulatory [[03:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11898.759999999998s)]
*  authorities, for example, provincial regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11906.599999999999s)]
*  potentially interested in all these issues as well. So we need to be thinking about who we're [[03:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11913.08s)]
*  partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks, [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11918.36s)]
*  and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. So that's how I see our [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11924.76s)]
*  role. Thanks so much, Michelle. And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11931.72s)]
*  the coordination, cooperation across countries. Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11943.64s)]
*  but they also brought issues around governance and legal certainty, which are extremely important [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11953.72s)]
*  across countries. So how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11966.039999999999s)]
*  economies, but also emerging markets and developing economies? Well, it's very important to have [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11974.119999999999s)]
*  coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11980.919999999998s)]
*  nationally. Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. I think central banks should [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11987.24s)]
*  play a leading role, but also how to engage with the private sector. Most of the development, [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=11993.8s)]
*  most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. Now, [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12001.08s)]
*  I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private sector [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12007.8s)]
*  in a more coherent fashion. What we see in technology is that they are very big players. [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12016.359999999999s)]
*  They tend to dominate the game, and we can end up with walled gardens, where you have fragmentation [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12023.96s)]
*  and you don't have a lot of integration. So we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12031.4s)]
*  the resources of the private sector, but in a way that brings together an efficient, competitive [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12037.4s)]
*  financial system open to everybody. The other important part, the other important pillar, [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12044.2s)]
*  is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that we have in today's [[03:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12050.519999999999s)]
*  traditional banking system. Pieroculti is old-fashioned. I don't think it's old-fashioned. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12058.439999999999s)]
*  I think it's essential to have the trust that a central bank brings in itself, which is to [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12063.8s)]
*  facilitate the singleness of money and finality. I think precisely to preserve the element of [[03:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12071.88s)]
*  trust is essential. So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of [[03:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12082.199999999999s)]
*  steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12087.48s)]
*  banks behave? Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12094.44s)]
*  more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[03:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12104.92s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture [[03:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12113.560000000001s)]
*  together. Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate [[03:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12119.64s)]
*  regulatory framework. This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12126.519999999999s)]
*  of tokenized assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts, and the [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12133.8s)]
*  relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. We need to assure [[03:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12139.88s)]
*  interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, but between traditional and [[03:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12147.4s)]
*  new expressions of the financial system. We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12154.76s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational [[03:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12163.4s)]
*  assets and platforms. This is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask [[03:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12171.48s)]
*  of what we do today already. Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate [[03:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12178.52s)]
*  technological representation. Here, I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits, [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12185.56s)]
*  and tokenized government bonds, and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12194.6s)]
*  Also, we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to connect [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12203.08s)]
*  the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[03:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12212.44s)]
*  Fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. I think that is essential. I think [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12220.839999999998s)]
*  there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. Most of it, I would say, is there, [[03:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12226.599999999999s)]
*  but we need to find ways to coordinate this. I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12233.08s)]
*  will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals, and it would facilitate [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12241.24s)]
*  to get where we want. In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12247.88s)]
*  BIS is there for. We are the bank of the central banks. The fact that the BIS has been [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12254.84s)]
*  doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12263.08s)]
*  subject matter. We don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12268.92s)]
*  to the expression of interest. What we have done through the hope is more than anything of an [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12277.0s)]
*  expression of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[03:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12283.4s)]
*  In any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. I think the IMF, [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12294.36s)]
*  through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development and so on, [[03:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12302.039999999999s)]
*  can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12311.72s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. One of the things you pointed to is AML-CFT. [[03:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12319.64s)]
*  So, how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? More specifically, [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12330.359999999999s)]
*  on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments and privacy, which is foundational for money, [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12340.279999999999s)]
*  but on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, AML-CFT compliance. How do you think [[03:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12351.48s)]
*  about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? Well, I think like everything [[03:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12359.24s)]
*  else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12365.16s)]
*  of the game, in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. Once those rules are well defined [[03:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12371.56s)]
*  and the playing field is defined, then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[03:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12379.96s)]
*  The third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12385.88s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating [[03:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12393.56s)]
*  internet labs across the world, the US, Europe, India and Singapore, and building the [[03:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12398.44s)]
*  composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12405.88s)]
*  tokenization in the real world. I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and [[03:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12411.8s)]
*  minds on it, we can actually see significant progress. It's really up to the people in this [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12417.8s)]
*  room to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value for [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12423.08s)]
*  inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress, that we have to make every effort [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12430.359999999999s)]
*  to expedite that. We are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the internet [[03:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12436.039999999999s)]
*  journey. So please, we are welcome. Okay, thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating [[03:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12441.32s)]
*  panel. I think there are many topics to explore. Let me again thank Augustin particularly for his [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12449.32s)]
*  long service in the international community. This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12456.119999999999s)]
*  Bank meetings in official capacity, but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12464.199999999999s)]
*  chapter. Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this very important [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12471.56s)]
*  topic. Thank you. And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12478.6s)]
*  is a growing interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12489.56s)]
*  in improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12497.24s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new developments, [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12505.8s)]
*  and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. We also observed that the Europeans and [[03:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12514.039999999999s)]
*  in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, in this space. From our contact with the market, [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12523.0s)]
*  we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT, and actually something [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12530.28s)]
*  like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. Also on [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12537.720000000001s)]
*  the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. We have also at the European [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12550.2s)]
*  level a specific legislation that allows that, so this might have improved the conditions so that [[03:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12557.16s)]
*  banks venture more easily into this. So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need [[03:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12567.320000000002s)]
*  to be in this space very early on for two fundamental reasons. The one reason is the fact [[03:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12578.28s)]
*  that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else will be there. We don't have anything [[03:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12584.04s)]
*  against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12589.400000000001s)]
*  new fragmentation of the system and credit risk, which is near and into commercial bank money, [[03:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12596.12s)]
*  so we need to be there immediately as a central bank money. The second reason is that the market [[03:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12602.52s)]
*  is asking us to be there. From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central [[03:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12609.24s)]
*  bank money because market participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12615.960000000001s)]
*  So, with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, well from November, [[03:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12622.84s)]
*  we launched an experiment, a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12631.960000000001s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[03:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12641.240000000002s)]
*  The concept that we explored was this concept of synchronization or [[03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12650.76s)]
*  coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional [[03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12657.4s)]
*  system. The three central banks of the euro system, they invented a very interesting solution so that [[03:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12667.56s)]
*  you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank money [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12675.48s)]
*  in the RTGS basically. The experiment has been a big success. We had more than 60 participants [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12681.08s)]
*  exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing interest, more than what we were expecting. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12689.56s)]
*  The question is what do we do from there? We want to continue and get into production, [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12696.68s)]
*  move from the experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise soon a solution [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12702.44s)]
*  in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in expanding their [[03:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12709.4s)]
*  business on DLT while providing for us central bank money. Again, we are not at this stage putting [[03:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12715.560000000001s)]
*  money on the DLT on the same DLT where the assets are. This is for the short term. However, we are [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12723.16s)]
*  thinking about what to do in the long term. Here we are open to a much more possible [[03:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12731.88s)]
*  integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have on the same platform [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12737.88s)]
*  central bank money, commercial bank money assets. BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all [[03:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12746.12s)]
*  this and this is a possibility. An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of [[03:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12753.16s)]
*  fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of the special life of different use case [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12759.8s)]
*  or adapt to specific conditions or even allow for a better transition from the traditional [[03:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12767.64s)]
*  RTGS to this new solution. So the news is stay tuned. More to come. [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12776.759999999998s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much, Piero. Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[03:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12784.039999999999s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12793.0s)]
*  interchangeable to a first order approximation. There are some minor differences but DLT [[03:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12801.08s)]
*  tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12813.08s)]
*  International Settlement in Basel has been very active through its innovation hub in particular [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12820.84s)]
*  but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of working with central banks [[03:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12828.6s)]
*  to explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world. [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12837.48s)]
*  You have been particularly working on tokenization with central banks but also with commercial banks [[03:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12845.4s)]
*  and with technology firms. So where are you having done this for a number of years now? [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12851.880000000001s)]
*  Where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12858.76s)]
*  and the future of tokenization and finance? Well, thank you very much, Tobias. It's great [[03:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12864.84s)]
*  to be in this panel. We are two very distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero, and a tremendously [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12873.320000000002s)]
*  dynamic entrepreneur, thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[03:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12880.6s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. And of course, [[03:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12889.16s)]
*  I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12893.56s)]
*  very strong contributions in that respect. Now tokenization, first it's great that it has become [[03:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12900.199999999999s)]
*  a topic under which we can have a discussion like this. And tokenization in terms of its [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12909.88s)]
*  applicability to financial transactions. I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to [[03:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12916.68s)]
*  our financial transactions and the financial systems in general. I would say at least in two [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12926.68s)]
*  directions they can make very important contribution. First, it certainly can improve the way the [[03:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12934.36s)]
*  financial system works today. Where most developments have happened and most attention [[03:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12940.44s)]
*  has been paid off is with payments and well obviously currencies. But those are the most [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12949.08s)]
*  elementary type of transactions. Now today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12955.0s)]
*  scenes. It's tremendously complex, tremendously cumbersome. And it certainly would be good to make [[03:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12962.439999999999s)]
*  them far simpler. And that's something that tokenization can achieve. Today, for example, [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12971.24s)]
*  when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation, [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12977.4s)]
*  and settlement. Given that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12983.8s)]
*  especially on KYC, AML CFD. If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12989.48s)]
*  quite assured. And this can be applied not only for payments, but for many other financial [[03:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=12999.64s)]
*  transactions. In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13005.88s)]
*  which is to put everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation, and so on, [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13013.96s)]
*  in a contained chip, I would say, that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[03:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13027.32s)]
*  to the point that many of them, for example, we don't do today. Traditionally, if you have a [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13033.72s)]
*  discussion among economists, many contingent, the development of contingent assets or contingent [[03:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13041.72s)]
*  transactions are limited in its application because we don't have a way to put them together [[03:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13049.64s)]
*  and put them into play. Tokenization definitely could facilitate this. And therefore, tokenization [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13055.96s)]
*  can really be the future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[03:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13064.199999999999s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13072.279999999999s)]
*  is the fact that it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13079.56s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, [[03:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13088.92s)]
*  which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13095.64s)]
*  in an unmistakable way. Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, [[03:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13103.72s)]
*  very unsophisticated to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13111.24s)]
*  well-being of the different nations. The contribution of this for inclusion is very, [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13118.68s)]
*  very significant. And that's why we are supporting this fully at the PIS. Now, one can ask, [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13128.52s)]
*  make the following question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization. [[03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13137.56s)]
*  And I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts are isolated. [[03:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13145.0s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[03:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13154.76s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here. Nanda will speak later. I also will speak later [[03:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13162.68s)]
*  about it. I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of the ECB, [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13168.36s)]
*  you're trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, [[03:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13175.800000000001s)]
*  and to have a joint vision to promote this. If we have this vision, that could allow [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13182.44s)]
*  coordination devices. And we can go from individual innovations and making the parts [[03:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13191.0s)]
*  in a way work together in a virtuous way. In a way, that's what we're trying to do [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13198.44s)]
*  at the VIES Innovation Hub. We also have started with very specific projects. [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13206.68s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13214.28s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13220.28s)]
*  and make the system work as a whole. In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13225.960000000001s)]
*  let me mention two. For example, one is AGORA, which is a first effort, major effort, [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13234.04s)]
*  where we're working with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks, to really streamline [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13242.44s)]
*  dramatically cross-border payments. And this works based on technization. The enthusiasm is [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13248.28s)]
*  great, and this could be a major platform to really make cross-border payments extremely [[03:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13256.6s)]
*  efficient. And again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13263.880000000001s)]
*  broader developments. The other is Project Pine. And Project Pine basically uses, I would say, [[03:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13269.64s)]
*  the trilogy that I find that is important for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized [[03:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13278.599999999999s)]
*  way wholesale CBDC in the way that Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money, [[03:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13287.32s)]
*  and government securities in tokenized fashion. And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13295.64s)]
*  be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. So even [[03:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13304.68s)]
*  for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. I would say that our imagination is the [[03:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13310.6s)]
*  limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[03:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13317.88s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. A lot of progress has been made, [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13327.8s)]
*  but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. [[03:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13334.599999999999s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. You would have to [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13343.0s)]
*  access internet through a different device. You would have a different phone. You would have your [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13349.32s)]
*  camera. It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. Today you can do [[03:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13355.0s)]
*  it immediately because everything is integrated. If we can do that in the financial system, [[03:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13362.12s)]
*  we really would be making a huge breakthrough. And the important thing is that technology is there. [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13368.52s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. What we need to work is on many different aspects, [[03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13375.32s)]
*  regulation, coordination, the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13382.52s)]
*  to make this reality. I can comment more about that later, but in any case, I think that [[03:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13391.800000000001s)]
*  tokenization has a big promise into the future. Thanks so much, Agustín. [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13398.52s)]
*  It's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, and then [[03:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13406.68s)]
*  putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that. That is the current [[03:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13416.6s)]
*  juncture in many aspects. So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustín on this concept [[03:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13424.84s)]
*  that you labeled the Finternet, a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13436.84s)]
*  the internet. I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13448.12s)]
*  existing, and nowadays it is everywhere. I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13454.52s)]
*  payments and financial services we could have such a seamless object. So explain a little bit more [[03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13461.08s)]
*  your thinking around that, and particularly this intersection between the public and the private [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13471.240000000002s)]
*  sector in that regard. Thank you. I think technology has been integral to financial services [[03:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13476.84s)]
*  for several decades, and we have seen that, whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile [[03:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13486.68s)]
*  phone app, payments are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[03:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13493.64s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial [[03:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13500.36s)]
*  services. But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose-specific infrastructure with [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13507.08s)]
*  their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance, and clearly we have to think about [[03:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13514.12s)]
*  doing some things differently. And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that [[03:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13519.880000000001s)]
*  it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation [[03:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13527.0s)]
*  where money and assets are programmable, portable, and interoperable from day one. [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13534.36s)]
*  Now that's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. And this is where the idea of the Finternet [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13540.36s)]
*  came in. The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[03:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13546.44s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. Countries are talking about stable coins. [[03:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13553.88s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. So we're seeing a lot of work happening. But if you [[03:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13559.8s)]
*  really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this [[03:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13565.64s)]
*  new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. And the idea of the Finternet came [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13571.32s)]
*  about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. [[03:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13577.64s)]
*  And he had been writing about this new financial architecture. And my colleagues and I, Pramod, [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13584.92s)]
*  Siddharth, and myself had been working on population scale systems with billions of [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13594.199999999999s)]
*  users and billions of transactions over the last several years. So we got together and said, [[03:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13599.56s)]
*  can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? And that's how was [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13604.92s)]
*  born the idea of the Finternet. And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February [[03:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13612.44s)]
*  23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24. Now what we are trying to do is come out [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13619.24s)]
*  with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. So basically there are three [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13627.56s)]
*  important ways we look at it. One is we should design this to be user-centric. It's not about [[03:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13637.16s)]
*  institutions. It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the [[03:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13644.519999999999s)]
*  user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. So user-centricity is a big fundamental belief in [[03:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13650.68s)]
*  the Finternet. The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13659.960000000001s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13668.52s)]
*  bonds, they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. So this asset agnostic [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13675.16s)]
*  approach is very important to create a unified approach. The third thing is that this is not [[03:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13681.56s)]
*  for any purpose or geography, but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13687.8s)]
*  capable of doing this. And it should be able to be used anywhere. And we felt that if we put this [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13693.48s)]
*  point of view across, then at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be done [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13700.2s)]
*  in a more systematic fashion. Now it's exactly a year since we released this paper. It was April [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13706.84s)]
*  of 24 and a lot has happened since then. We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[03:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13714.04s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. Then second is that all of the [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13722.12s)]
*  world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[03:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13727.16s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. And as Augustine mentioned, we come [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13734.6s)]
*  from a background of actually getting things done. So that's where we have been working in the last [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13740.36s)]
*  one year. We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this Finternet would look like, [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13746.28s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. We have a universal information tokenized system [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13753.48s)]
*  and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13760.6s)]
*  using public chain technology. But we're not ready to any technologies, agnostic to which [[03:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13768.12s)]
*  technology that we use. And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13773.64s)]
*  companies. And we think over the next year, next few months by the end of, by December of this year, [[03:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13780.44s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. And these are in multiple [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13786.68s)]
*  areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. So I think we believe that the time has come [[03:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13793.720000000001s)]
*  to really implement the Finternet approach. And if we can work with making it user-centric, [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13801.800000000001s)]
*  universal and unified, we're really going to create a financial network that works for [[03:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13809.08s)]
*  everyone everywhere. And it's really a question of moving it now. I think we can demonstrate [[03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13815.16s)]
*  in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. Technology will be [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13822.44s)]
*  available. It will be available as open source. Any country, any company can use it. It's really [[03:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13827.32s)]
*  about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. So that's where [[03:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13833.32s)]
*  we are after one year. And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, [[03:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13838.36s)]
*  we can get there much faster. Great. Thanks so much for that insight. [[03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13844.92s)]
*  Let me turn back to Piero and ask about the broader capital market implications. I think [[03:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13852.76s)]
*  Agustin and Nandan already alluded to that and Michelle as well. So how do you see [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13862.52s)]
*  what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments [[03:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13872.36s)]
*  that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[03:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13883.4s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. We came from a situation [[03:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13895.0s)]
*  where our markets are completely fragmented. I don't even remember how many trading venues we [[03:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13904.28s)]
*  have. I think we are in the order of 41. We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. It's hard to talk [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13910.44s)]
*  about capital market in this condition. Fragmentation is a high cost. Access to finance is a problem. [[03:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13919.560000000001s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. So we see our effort in [[03:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13930.12s)]
*  terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization as also an effort [[03:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13937.88s)]
*  to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a unified financial capital market [[03:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13949.24s)]
*  in Europe. And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. The potential, [[03:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13956.759999999998s)]
*  the transformational potential of DLT, I think can be clustered in two groups. [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13964.84s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more [[03:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13970.44s)]
*  efficient way. And those are the low-hanging fruit. And then there is another dimension. [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13976.76s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13983.16s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? Just to give you some example, [[03:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=13993.08s)]
*  DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. So basically, we could have a unified [[03:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14000.36s)]
*  platform working around the clock all year long. Second, if you think today the three key function [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14010.2s)]
*  of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody are done on three different platforms. [[03:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14018.68s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. This would reduce [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14026.76s)]
*  reconciliation costs, time, and data processing. Third, if you think the effort we are making to [[03:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14032.2s)]
*  move to T plus something, right? Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14040.6s)]
*  immediately. So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient [[03:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14047.880000000001s)]
*  market. But the key difference will be the thinking about DLT as an enabler, as has been said, [[03:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14055.880000000001s)]
*  for new services. And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. Digitalization [[03:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14066.2s)]
*  changes the nature of money. Money is not any longer a scriptural, it is a file, a very sophisticated [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14073.400000000001s)]
*  file, but it's a file. So on a file, you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14081.400000000001s)]
*  when to pay, how to pay, conditional on all possible states of the world. So this is the kind [[03:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14088.36s)]
*  of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service and the financial sector [[03:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14095.0s)]
*  to a different stage. But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. It's a bumpy road. And many [[03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14105.72s)]
*  things can go wrong. So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new [[03:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14111.96s)]
*  fragmentation. We could end up in a system where competition is low, and we could end up in a [[03:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14119.8s)]
*  situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. So we need something [[03:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14126.92s)]
*  that avoids fragmentation, increase competition, and make sure that innovation state had even at [[03:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14134.439999999999s)]
*  the infrastructure level. Let me stop here. Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14141.64s)]
*  lack of ambition on this panel. I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market [[03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14149.4s)]
*  integration. From the nun we heard a really very foundational innovation around finance. So [[03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14162.039999999999s)]
*  Michelle, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[03:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14174.119999999999s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. Central banks have a clear mandate. [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14181.88s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14190.44s)]
*  to innovation, and as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector? [[03:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14199.64s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. I think central banks do have a role. One of our own strategic priorities at [[03:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14208.84s)]
*  the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. I don't mean dictate the [[03:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14216.68s)]
*  future of money. I don't mean mandate the future of money. But I think helping to determine the [[03:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14221.64s)]
*  future of money is really important. From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, [[03:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14227.08s)]
*  we are all in the payment system. We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems. [[03:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14231.56s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are a very [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14238.68s)]
*  important potential use case for tokenisation. So against all that, I think it's incumbent upon [[03:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14244.36s)]
*  central banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. We need to be [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14251.08s)]
*  working with them, I think. So it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more [[03:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14257.32s)]
*  than that. I think it's a partnership role as well. And I think what central banks can bring, [[03:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14261.96s)]
*  and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14268.12s)]
*  public policy's interests as well. Because these things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really [[03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14276.2s)]
*  critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. So there is a very big public policy [[03:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14284.84s)]
*  interest in this as well. And I think that's what central banks can bring to this. So in our own [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14290.04s)]
*  thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises [[03:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14296.12s)]
*  are, for example, how will this innovation promote and be or be consistent with monetary and financial [[03:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14301.8s)]
*  stability? Because that's obviously important to us. What sort of issues are there for the [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14308.679999999998s)]
*  tokenisation of potential asset classes? And how will they promote safety and resilience as well as [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14315.0s)]
*  efficiency of markets? So I think these are really important questions, and central banks bring [[03:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14322.519999999999s)]
*  that perspective to it. I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive [[03:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14327.4s)]
*  way, I think we'll be completely behind the curve. And we might end up with circumstances which aren't [[03:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14334.2s)]
*  ideal. So for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central [[03:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14339.800000000001s)]
*  bank money is the safest way to do it. It's not the only way, but it is. And all our high value [[03:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14346.52s)]
*  systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. So if we don't engage with this and think [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14354.36s)]
*  about how the new tokenisation might be, you might pair with payments, then we might get left out of [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14363.08s)]
*  it. And that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. So again, [[03:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14371.880000000001s)]
*  we think we're not going to drive this. We're not going to tell people what to do, but I think it's [[03:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14379.48s)]
*  really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money might be used in these circumstances, [[03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14384.6s)]
*  and what the policy implications might be of that. And there's another point here I think is worth [[03:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14393.0s)]
*  making, is that other regulatory authorities, for example, prudential regulators, consumer regulators, [[04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14401.16s)]
*  and the government are also potentially interested in all these issues as well. So we need to be [[04:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14407.88s)]
*  thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. Ultimately, [[04:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14413.56s)]
*  these sorts of things are networks. And they need lots of stakeholders co-operating in order to make [[04:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14418.039999999999s)]
*  them work. So that's how I see our role. Thanks so much, Michelle. And leading onto [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14425.8s)]
*  that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the co-ordination, co-operation across countries. [[04:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14434.84s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, but there are also broader [[04:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14443.880000000001s)]
*  issues around governance and legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. [[04:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14453.4s)]
*  So how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14462.52s)]
*  but also emerging markets and developing economies? Well, it's very important to have [[04:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14470.36s)]
*  coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, [[04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14476.6s)]
*  nationally. Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. I think central banks should [[04:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14483.080000000002s)]
*  play a leading role. But also how to engage with the private sector. Most of the development, [[04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14490.039999999999s)]
*  most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. [[04:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14497.32s)]
*  Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation [[04:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14502.92s)]
*  of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. What we see in technology is that there are very [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14511.16s)]
*  big players. They tend to dominate the game, and we can end up with walled gardens, where you have [[04:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14518.36s)]
*  fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. So we need to exploit the energy, [[04:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14526.68s)]
*  the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in a way that brings together an efficient, [[04:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14532.84s)]
*  competitive financial system open to everybody. The other important part, the other important pillar [[04:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14539.640000000001s)]
*  is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that we have in today's [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14546.76s)]
*  traditional banking system. I don't think it's old-fashioned. I think it's essential [[04:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14554.76s)]
*  is to have the trust that a central bank brings in itself, which is to facilitate the singleness [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14562.12s)]
*  of money and finality. I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14569.96s)]
*  So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of the private [[04:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14580.279999999999s)]
*  sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? Again, let me emphasize [[04:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14586.599999999999s)]
*  number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly what is the vision [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14596.519999999999s)]
*  in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. We need to get people [[04:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14604.199999999999s)]
*  working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture together. Number two, [[04:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14611.24s)]
*  we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. [[04:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14617.8s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets, [[04:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14624.68s)]
*  data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts, and the relationship between [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14631.880000000001s)]
*  tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. We need to assure interoperability [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14637.64s)]
*  between not only across jurisdictions, but between traditional and new expressions of the financial [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14646.12s)]
*  system. We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. Third, I think that again, [[04:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14653.4s)]
*  central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14662.6s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we do today already. [[04:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14669.56s)]
*  Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[04:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14677.56s)]
*  So here, I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits, and tokenized government bonds, [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14683.960000000001s)]
*  and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. And also, we might support [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14692.76s)]
*  the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to connect the unified layers [[04:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14702.359999999999s)]
*  to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. And fourth, I think we need to [[04:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14709.4s)]
*  work for private-public partnerships. I think that is essential. I think there's a lot that the [[04:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14717.32s)]
*  private sector can bring to the table. Most of it, I would say, is there, but we need to find where [[04:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14723.16s)]
*  to find ways to coordinate this. I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously [[04:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14731.16s)]
*  powerful towards these four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[04:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14739.16s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. I mean, [[04:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14747.48s)]
*  we are the bank of the central banks. The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this [[04:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14753.88s)]
*  is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. I mean, [[04:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14760.92s)]
*  we don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14767.48s)]
*  of interest. So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression [[04:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14774.12s)]
*  of the interest and the relevance that central bank attributes to this subject. [[04:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14782.76s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. I think the IMF, [[04:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14789.08s)]
*  through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development, and so on, [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14799.800000000001s)]
*  can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[04:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14807.880000000001s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. One of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so, Nandan, [[04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14814.68s)]
*  how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? More specifically, on the one [[04:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14827.480000000001s)]
*  hand, you want to have ease of payments and privacy, which is foundational for money, [[04:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14837.0s)]
*  but on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. So how do you [[04:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14847.720000000001s)]
*  think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? Well, I think like everything [[04:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14855.320000000002s)]
*  else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules of [[04:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14861.48s)]
*  the game, in the regulations that will govern the tokenization, and once those rules are well [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14867.96s)]
*  defined and the playing field is defined, then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[04:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14875.48s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[04:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14882.039999999999s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating [[04:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14889.8s)]
*  internet labs across the world, the US, Europe, India, and Singapore, and building the [[04:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14894.68s)]
*  composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of [[04:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14902.119999999999s)]
*  tokenization in the real world. And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts [[04:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14908.039999999999s)]
*  and minds on it, we can actually see significant progress. And it's really up to the people in [[04:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14913.96s)]
*  this room to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value [[04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14919.08s)]
*  for inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress, that we have to make every effort to [[04:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14926.359999999999s)]
*  expedite that. And we are on this journey, and anybody can join us if they want on the [[04:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14932.519999999999s)]
*  internet journey. So please, we are welcome. [[04:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14937.16s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating panel. I think there are many [[04:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14942.36s)]
*  topics to explore. Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the [[04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14947.48s)]
*  international community. This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in [[04:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14954.039999999999s)]
*  official capacity, but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. Thank [[04:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14961.32s)]
*  you so much for all panelists, and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[04:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14969.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14975.8s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14980.279999999999s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in [[04:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14986.52s)]
*  improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[04:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=14993.720000000001s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new developments, [[04:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15002.12s)]
*  and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. We also observed that the European, [[04:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15010.28s)]
*  in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, in this space. From our contact with the market, [[04:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15019.320000000002s)]
*  we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT, and actually something [[04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15026.6s)]
*  like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. Also, [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15034.04s)]
*  on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. We have also the European [[04:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15046.36s)]
*  level, a specific legislation that allows that, so this might have improved the conditions so that [[04:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15053.480000000001s)]
*  banks venture more easily into this. So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15063.56s)]
*  to be in this space very early on for two fundamental reasons. The one reason is the fact that if we are [[04:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15074.519999999999s)]
*  not there with central bank money, somebody else will be there. We don't have anything against [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15080.92s)]
*  commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15086.92s)]
*  of the system and credit risk, which is near and into commercial bank money, so that we need to be [[04:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15093.32s)]
*  there immediately as a central bank money. And the second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[04:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15100.36s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15107.56s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. So, with this situation in mind, [[04:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15113.56s)]
*  last year from May to September, well from November, we launched an experiment, [[04:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15123.24s)]
*  a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment and [[04:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15132.52s)]
*  transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. The concept that we [[04:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15140.6s)]
*  explored was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with [[04:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15148.76s)]
*  our target services, which is our traditional system. The three central banks of the euro system, [[04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15158.04s)]
*  they invented a very interesting solution so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and [[04:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15167.32s)]
*  the settlement on central bank money in the FTGS basically. The experiment have been a big success. [[04:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15175.0s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing interest, [[04:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15182.44s)]
*  more than what we were expecting. So, the question is what do we do from there? So, we want to continue [[04:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15190.6s)]
*  and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into production, and we will devise [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15197.16s)]
*  soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in [[04:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15204.44s)]
*  expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central bank money. Again, we are not at [[04:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15210.92s)]
*  this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets are. This is for the short [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15218.12s)]
*  term. However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term and here we are open to a much [[04:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15225.560000000001s)]
*  more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15232.76s)]
*  on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. BIS has been very vocal about [[04:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15241.08s)]
*  the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. An alternative possibility would be to have an [[04:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15248.44s)]
*  ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of, you know, could specialize [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15255.16s)]
*  from different use case or adapt to specific condition or even allow for a better transition [[04:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15262.28s)]
*  from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. So, the news is stay tuned. More to come. [[04:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15271.72s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much, Piero. Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15280.279999999999s)]
*  So, when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly [[04:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15289.24s)]
*  interchangeable to a first order approximation. So, you know, it is there are some minor [[04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15297.32s)]
*  differences but, you know, DLT tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. [[04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15306.44s)]
*  So, Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[04:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15313.480000000001s)]
*  its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of working [[04:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15322.2s)]
*  with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around [[04:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15331.56s)]
*  the world and you have been particularly working on tokenization, you know, with central bank but [[04:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15340.359999999999s)]
*  also with commercial banks and with technology firms. So, where are you, you know, having done [[04:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15346.439999999999s)]
*  this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15353.32s)]
*  to the financial system and so like the future of tokenization and finance? [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15359.32s)]
*  Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Tobias. It's great to be in this panel. [[04:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15367.0s)]
*  We two very distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur, [[04:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15371.16s)]
*  thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality and I think that's why [[04:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15379.4s)]
*  it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us and of course I would say Tobias is an [[04:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15386.36s)]
*  honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always very strong contributions [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15391.24s)]
*  in that respect. Now, tokenization, first it's great that it has become a topic under which we [[04:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15398.44s)]
*  can have a discussion like this. And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial [[04:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15407.640000000001s)]
*  transactions. I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[04:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15414.6s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. I would say at least in two directions they can make [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15425.24s)]
*  very important contribution. First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15432.12s)]
*  The most where more of most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15439.4s)]
*  is with payments and well obviously currencies but those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[04:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15446.36s)]
*  Now today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously complex, [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15453.800000000001s)]
*  tremendously cumbersome and it certainly would behoove us to make them far simpler. And that's [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15461.0s)]
*  something that tokenization can achieve. Today for example when you do a payment usually there is a [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15469.800000000001s)]
*  separation between messaging, reconciliation and settlement. Given that separation many mistakes [[04:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15477.0s)]
*  can be made, controls can be lost especially on KYC, AML CFD. If you integrate everything [[04:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15483.56s)]
*  the efficiency of the system is quite assured and this can be applied not only for payments [[04:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15492.68s)]
*  but for many other financial transactions. In that sense tokenization also allows something that [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15500.359999999999s)]
*  we can call programmability which is to put everything, all the instructions, [[04:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15507.8s)]
*  all the procedures, regulation and so on in a contained chip I would say that would allow [[04:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15516.279999999999s)]
*  the execution of very complex transactions to the point that many of them for example we don't [[04:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15526.84s)]
*  do today. I mean traditionally if you have a discussion among economists many contingent, [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15534.199999999999s)]
*  the development of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application [[04:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15543.0s)]
*  because we don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. tokenization definitely [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15549.4s)]
*  could facilitate this and therefore tokenization can really be the future of a [[04:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15556.44s)]
*  financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. Another very attractive [[04:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15564.12s)]
*  aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that it would allow [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15570.04s)]
*  many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. India for example is a great example [[04:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15579.72s)]
*  and through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen which is the identity of people [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15587.960000000001s)]
*  and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. Really what you can do [[04:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15595.880000000001s)]
*  is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated to something where [[04:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15604.039999999999s)]
*  you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being of the different [[04:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15610.759999999998s)]
*  nations. The contribution of this for inclusion is very very significant and that's why we are [[04:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15616.679999999998s)]
*  supporting this fully at the BIS. Now one can ask make the following question why the take-up [[04:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15627.64s)]
*  outside crypto has been slow in tokenization and I think part of it is because we have [[04:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15636.76s)]
*  unleashed many efforts but those efforts are isolated. We have not been fully been able to [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15645.4s)]
*  fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. We have tried it through the internet here [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15653.64s)]
*  in Nandan. We'll speak later. I also will speak later about it. I really welcome what Piero just [[04:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15661.56s)]
*  said about the fact that in the sphere of DCB you're trying to integrate central bank money, [[04:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15667.56s)]
*  commercial bank money, different assets and to have a joint vision to promote this. [[04:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15675.88s)]
*  If we have this vision that could allow a coordination devices and we can go from [[04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15683.24s)]
*  individual innovations and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15690.6s)]
*  In a way that's what we're trying to do at the BIS Innovation Hub. We also have started with very [[04:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15700.84s)]
*  specific projects. Many of them do not fit together but now we're paying attention on how [[04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15707.96s)]
*  they can fit together and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation [[04:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15714.919999999998s)]
*  and make the system work as a whole. In terms of the for example the projects that we have been doing [[04:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15722.199999999999s)]
*  let me mention two. For example one is Agora which is a first effort [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15729.56s)]
*  major effort where we're working with 40 commercial banks seven central banks to really [[04:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15737.48s)]
*  streamline dramatically cross-border payments and this base works based on the organization. [[04:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15743.72s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great and this could be a major platform to really make a cross-border payments [[04:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15750.52s)]
*  extremely efficient and again this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15759.08s)]
*  broader developments. The other is project Pine and project Pine basically uses I would say the [[04:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15765.88s)]
*  trilogy that I find that is important for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized [[04:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15775.96s)]
*  way wholesale CBDC in the way that Michelle expressed commercial bank digital money and [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15783.56s)]
*  and a government securities in tokenized fashion and here the idea on the project Pine is how can this [[04:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15792.439999999999s)]
*  be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. So even for [[04:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15800.919999999998s)]
*  those purposes the tokenization effort could be great. I would say that that our imagination is [[04:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15807.08s)]
*  the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[04:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15813.96s)]
*  Today again it's difficult very difficult to make transactions a lot of progress has been made but [[04:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15824.039999999999s)]
*  at some point we need to achieve for example what in telecommunications was achieved. [[04:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15831.08s)]
*  Many years ago like 10 years ago you would have a messaging machine you would have to [[04:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15839.32s)]
*  access internet through a different device you would have a different phone you would have your [[04:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15845.64s)]
*  camera it would be tremendously difficult even to to take a photograph and send it. Today you can [[04:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15851.32s)]
*  do it immediately because everything is integrated. If we can do that in the financial system we [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15858.2s)]
*  really would be making a huge breakthrough and the important thing is that technology is there. [[04:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15865.08s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. What we need to work is on many different aspects [[04:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15871.64s)]
*  regulation regulation coordination the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15878.84s)]
*  this reality. I can comment more about that later but in any case I think that the [[04:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15888.44s)]
*  tokenization has a big promise into the future. Thanks so much Agustin and yes so [[04:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15894.76s)]
*  you know it's really the interplay between innovation which you know may [[04:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15902.6s)]
*  go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around [[04:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15910.68s)]
*  that. That is the current juncture in many aspects. So Nandan you have worked with Agustin [[04:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15917.4s)]
*  on this concept that you labeled the internet. So you know a kind of [[04:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15930.6s)]
*  you know global payment system that is just as seamless as the internet. I think [[04:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15939.08s)]
*  30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet existing and nowadays it is [[04:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15946.84s)]
*  everywhere. And I think the internet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial [[04:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15952.76s)]
*  services we could have such a seamless object. So explain a little bit more your thinking around that [[04:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15959.4s)]
*  and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[04:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15969.16s)]
*  Thank you. I think I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades [[04:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15974.44s)]
*  and we have seen that whether it's in banking the branch you know mobile phone app payments are [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15984.04s)]
*  becoming instant. You can order ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. So clearly the financial sector [[04:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15991.560000000001s)]
*  has been the leadership or applying technology to financial services. But all these solutions we have [[04:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=15999.08s)]
*  tend to be siloed purpose specific infrastructure with their own applications their own data [[04:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16006.84s)]
*  their own maintenance. And clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. And I think [[04:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16012.6s)]
*  why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing the old way [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16018.84s)]
*  of doing things. It's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable portable [[04:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16026.28s)]
*  and interoperable from day one. That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. And this [[04:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16034.44s)]
*  is where the idea of the internet came in. The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts [[04:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16041.08s)]
*  around the world on tokenization. Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[04:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16047.24s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. Some people are trying to tokenize bonds deposits. So we're seeing a lot of work [[04:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16053.08s)]
*  happening. But if you really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this new [[04:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16060.12s)]
*  financial metaphor then we have to think differently. And the idea of the internet came about because Augustine and I met in [[04:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16067.24s)]
*  Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. And he had been writing about the internet writing about this new financial architecture. [[04:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16076.92s)]
*  And my colleagues and I promote said that and myself had been working on population scale systems with billions of users and [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16087.08s)]
*  billions of transactions over the last several years. So we got together and said can we apply that population scale [[04:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16096.68s)]
*  generic approach to tokenization. And that's how was born the idea of the internet. And this was a paper which we started [[04:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16103.72s)]
*  thinking about in February 23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16113.72s)]
*  Now what we are trying to do is come out with a road map on how we can tokenize assets across the world. So basically there are [[04:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16121.64s)]
*  three important ways we look at it. One is we should design this to be user centric. It's not about institutions. It's about [[04:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16133.0s)]
*  putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user with the user can buy sell transfer assets of any type. So user [[04:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16142.68s)]
*  centricity is a big fundamental belief in the internet. The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of [[04:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16153.32s)]
*  assets. In other words whether the asset is money or securities property liabilities whatever it is bonds they should all be [[04:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16163.48s)]
*  able to work with the same infrastructure. So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[04:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16173.039999999999s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is [[04:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16182.24s)]
*  capable of doing this. And it should be able to be used anywhere. And we felt that if we put this point of view across the [[04:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16189.72s)]
*  net is creating a vision of what is possible possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. Now it's exactly a [[04:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16198.119999999999s)]
*  year since we released this paper. It was April of 24 and a lot has happened since then. We find that the technology is [[04:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16207.88s)]
*  actually quite mature enough. We thought it was experimental but we believe it's more mature. Then second is that all of the [[04:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16216.32s)]
*  world the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. And I think there's a sense [[04:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16223.48s)]
*  of possibility everywhere. And as Augustine mentioned we we come from a background of actually getting things done. So that's [[04:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16231.96s)]
*  where we have been working in the last one year. We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this Internet would look [[04:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16240.839999999998s)]
*  like how you do credentialing how you create wallets. We have a universal information tokenized system and we're actually [[04:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16249.039999999999s)]
*  demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. But we're not [[04:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16257.74s)]
*  ready to any technologies agnostic to which technology that we use. And pilots are underway today both with central bankers [[04:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16267.64s)]
*  and with companies. And we think over the next year the next few months by the end of by December of this year we'll actually [[04:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16275.94s)]
*  have enough working technology to show this working. And these are in multiple areas deposits and wallets legends. So I think [[04:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16283.58s)]
*  we believe that the time has come to really implement the Internet approach. And if we can work with making it user centric [[04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16295.9s)]
*  universal and unified we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. And it's really a [[04:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16305.34s)]
*  question of moving it. Now I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16314.22s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. Any country any company can use it. It's really about applying [[04:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16322.54s)]
*  it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. So that's where we are after one year. And we are very [[04:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16330.34s)]
*  confident that if the world embraces this approach we can get there much faster. [[04:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16337.54s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for for that insight. Let me turn back to to Piero and you know ask about the broader capital market [[04:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16344.94s)]
*  implications. I think I've seen and none done already alluded to to that and Michelle as well. So how do you see sort of [[04:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16357.16s)]
*  like you know how what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments you know that [[04:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16369.84s)]
*  are you know oftentimes beyond beyond the normal operational reach of central banks. [[04:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16381.44s)]
*  So you know this is this question is particularly interesting for the European market. You know we come from a situation where our [[04:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16391.28s)]
*  markets are completely fragmented. I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. I think we are in the order of 41. [[04:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16401.12s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSE Europe. It's hard to talk about capital market. You know in this condition fragmentation is a high [[04:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16410.32s)]
*  cost access to finance is a problem. Market based finance for small and medium enterprises a problem. So we see our effort in terms [[04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16422.36s)]
*  of developing a unified ledger or some some new platform based on tokenization as also an effort an effort to improve the condition of [[04:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16434.56s)]
*  the capital at least the backbone of a financial capital unified financial capital markets in Europe and to simplify. I can [[04:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16447.48s)]
*  simplify by thinking to to to the dimension right. The potential the transformational potential of the L.T. I think can be clustered in two groups. [[04:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16456.2s)]
*  As I was saying we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. And those are the low hanging fruit. [[04:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16466.84s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. What can we do with the L.T. tokenization that we don't do. We cannot do today. [[04:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16477.04s)]
*  Because of the way we treat money. Now on the first front is pretty simple right. For just just to give you some some example. The L.T. would allow you to [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16486.4s)]
*  trade 24 7 360 days. So basically we could have a unified you know platform working working around the clock all year long. [[04:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16497.96s)]
*  Second if you think today the tricky function of trading is you know the negotiation the settlement and the custody are done on the three different [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16510.879999999997s)]
*  platform. You know we could bring on the DLT on the same platform the three function. This would reduce reconciliation costs the time and [[04:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16520.879999999997s)]
*  the data processing. Third if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something right through digitalization through the L.T. [[04:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16531.16s)]
*  we could move to T plus zero immediately. So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. But the key key [[04:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16542.079999999998s)]
*  difference will be the thinking about the L.T. as a nibbler as has been said for new services. And to me everything boils down to one single [[04:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16554.64s)]
*  concept. Digitalization changes the nature of money. Money is not any longer a scriptural is a is a file a very sophisticated file but is a [[04:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16567.16s)]
*  so on a file you can put all the condition you want. And so you can decide when to pay how to pay conditional on all possible state of the [[04:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16579.600000000002s)]
*  world. So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to to make that you know the financial service and the financial [[04:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16589.08s)]
*  sector to a different stage. But let me conclude this is not an easy road is a bumpy road and many things can go wrong. So we need to do it in a [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16601.84s)]
*  very attentive way because we can end up in new fragmentation. We could end up in a system that where competition is low and we could end up in a [[04:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16611.079999999998s)]
*  situation where we will be where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. So we need you know something that avoid [[04:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16623.16s)]
*  fragmentation increase competition and make sure that innovation state had even at the infrastructure level. Let me stop here. [[04:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16631.32s)]
*  Thanks so much. Piero and I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. I think Piero you know really aims at you know the [[04:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16640.84s)]
*  broader financial market integration from the nun we heard you know a really a very foundational innovation around finance. So [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16656.44s)]
*  Michelle turning turning back to you. How do you see the role of central banks in all of this. You know money of course is the [[04:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16670.44s)]
*  foundation of the financial system. You know central banks have a clear mandate. You know how can central banks help in this you know [[04:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16679.72s)]
*  broader transition to a new technological underpinning to innovation. And as you already alluded to to this tight interconnection with the [[04:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16690.24s)]
*  private sector. Thanks Tobias. I think central banks do have a role. Our own one of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of [[04:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16703.76s)]
*  Australia is to help shape the future of money. I don't mean dictate the future of money. I don't mean mandate the future of money but I [[04:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16713.719999999998s)]
*  think helping to determine the future money is really important from our own perspective. And I think many central banks we are all in [[04:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16721.76s)]
*  the payment system. We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems in our own case. We're also supervisors of financial market [[04:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16728.68s)]
*  infrastructures which are a very important potential use case for tokenization. So against all that I think it's incumbent upon central banks to [[04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16739.12s)]
*  take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. We need to be working with them I think. So it's sort of a catalyst role but it's [[04:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16748.08s)]
*  also a little bit more than that. I think it's a partnership role as well. And I think what central banks can bring and I think what I think of [[04:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16757.32s)]
*  ourselves of bringing is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public. What's in public policies interests as well because these [[04:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16765.6s)]
*  things are. Yes it's commercial but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. So there is a very big public policy [[04:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16777.64s)]
*  interest in this and well I think that's what central banks can bring to this. So in our own thinking about this some of the questions we'll be [[04:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16786.32s)]
*  asking ourselves as we go through these exercises are for example how will this innovation promote and be or be consistent with monetary and [[04:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16795.2s)]
*  financial stability because that's obviously important to us. What sort of issues are there for the tokenization of potential asset classes and how [[04:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16804.4s)]
*  will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets. So I think these are really important questions and central banks bring that [[04:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16814.88s)]
*  perspective to it. I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way I think we'll be completely behind the curve and we might end [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16823.920000000002s)]
*  up with circumstances which aren't ideal. So for example at the moment we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the [[04:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16834.32s)]
*  safest way to do it. It's not the only way but it is and a lot of our high value systems at the moment they settle in central bank money. So if we don't engage with this and think [[04:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16844.719999999998s)]
*  about how the new tokenization might be you might pair with payments then we might get left out of it and that might have good results for financial stability and [[04:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16859.32s)]
*  settlement risk. So again we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what to do but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central [[04:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16873.08s)]
*  banks, central bank money might be used in these circumstances and what the policy implications might be of that. And there's another point here I think is worth making is that other [[04:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16883.800000000003s)]
*  regulatory authorities for example prudential regulators, consumer regulators and the government are also potentially interested in all these issues as well. So we need to be thinking about who we're [[04:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16898.28s)]
*  partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. Ultimately these sorts of things are networks and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. So that's how I see our role. [[04:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16910.92s)]
*  Thanks so much Michelle and leading on to that let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. Of course Michelle mentioned settlement issues but they're also broader issues around governance and [[04:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16924.6s)]
*  legal certainty which are extremely important across countries. So how do you see that playing out across countries and not just advanced economies but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[04:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16954.04s)]
*  Well it's very important to have coordination, cooperation internationally but primarily I would say at the beginning nationally. Now the main coordination has to be between authorities. I think central banks should play a leading role but also how to engage with the private sector. [[04:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16970.04s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. Now I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. [[04:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=16991.8s)]
*  What we see in technology is that they are very big players, they tend to dominate the game and we can end up with walled gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. So we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector but in a way that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17010.92s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[04:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17039.640000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's old fashioned, I think it's essential to have the trust that central banks bring in itself which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[04:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17052.76s)]
*  So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? [[04:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17076.600000000002s)]
*  Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[04:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17088.84s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal but we need to try to bring that picture together. Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. [[04:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17106.12s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[04:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17121.0s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions but between traditional and new expressions of the financial system. We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17138.2s)]
*  Third, I think that again central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. This is something that happens today so it's not an additional ask of what we do today already. [[04:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17155.88s)]
*  Now we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized government bonds and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[04:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17173.96s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to connect the unified ledgers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[04:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17195.32s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. I think that is essential. I think there is a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. Most of it I would say is there but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[04:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17213.16s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[04:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17229.96s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well that's what the BIS is there for. I mean we are the bank of the central banks. The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[04:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17243.72s)]
*  I mean we don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest and the relevance that central bank attributes to this subject. [[04:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17262.84s)]
*  So in any way I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort and I think the IMF through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development and so on can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[04:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17285.0s)]
*  So one of the things you pointed to is the EMLCFT and so Nandan, how do you think about the public and private sector interplay and more specifically on the one hand you want to have ease of payments and privacy which is foundational for money. [[04:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17315.24s)]
*  But on the other hand you need to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. So how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17344.2s)]
*  Well I think like everything else we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17356.440000000002s)]
*  And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17370.079999999998s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology because tokenization technology needs to be demystified and made available in a much larger way which is what we are doing which is creating fintanet labs across the world, the US, Europe, India and Singapore. [[04:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17377.88s)]
*  And building the composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization in the real world. [[04:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17396.600000000002s)]
*  And I think over the next few years if we really put our hearts and minds on it we can actually see significant progress. [[04:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17406.2s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value for inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[04:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17414.64s)]
*  And we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the fintanet journey. So please we are welcome. [[04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17429.64s)]
*  Okay thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating panel. I think there are many topics to explore. Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international community. [[04:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17437.52s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17452.52s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[04:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17465.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17471.4s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale we have been observing that there is a growing interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in improving the current situation of financial markets. [[04:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17476.4s)]
*  Essentially because DLT and tokenization allow a different representation of assets in a digital form and this allows many new developments and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[04:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17495.280000000002s)]
*  We also observed that the European banks are pretty active in this field, in this space. [[04:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17511.16s)]
*  From our contact with the market we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT and actually something like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementation. [[04:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17520.16s)]
*  Also on the security side we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[04:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17541.16s)]
*  We have also the European level of specific legislation that allows that so this might have improved the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[04:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17548.16s)]
*  So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space very early on for two fundamental reasons. [[04:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17564.04s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money somebody else will be there. [[04:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17575.04s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk which is near and in terms of the future. [[04:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17581.04s)]
*  So we need to be there immediately as a central bank money. [[04:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17594.04s)]
*  The second reason is that the market is asking us to be there. [[04:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17600.04s)]
*  From our contact with the market we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[04:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17604.04s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, from November we launched an experiment, [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17615.920000000002s)]
*  a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[04:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17628.920000000002s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services which is our traditional system. [[04:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17643.8s)]
*  The three central banks of the Euro system invented a very interesting solution so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank money in the FTGS. [[04:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17661.68s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. [[04:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17676.68s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing interest more than what we were expecting. [[04:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17679.68s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[04:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17689.56s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into production and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central bank money. [[04:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17692.56s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets are. [[04:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17713.440000000002s)]
*  This is for the short term. [[04:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17720.440000000002s)]
*  However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term and here we are open to a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money, assets. [[04:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17723.440000000002s)]
*  You know, BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17742.32s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of, you know, could specialize for different use case or adapt to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional FTGS to this new. [[04:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17748.32s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned, more to come. [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17772.32s)]
*  Great. [[04:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17776.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero and let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17778.32s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly interchangeable to first order approximation. [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17785.32s)]
*  So, you know, it is there are some minor differences, but, you know, DLT tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. [[04:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17797.2s)]
*  So, Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through its innovation hub in particular, but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of working with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world. [[04:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17810.08s)]
*  And you have been particularly working on tokenization, you know, with central bank, but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. [[04:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17837.960000000003s)]
*  So where are you, you know, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and so like the future of tokenization and finance? [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17846.960000000003s)]
*  Well, thank you. Thank you very much, Tobias. It's great to be in this panel. We do very distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[04:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17862.84s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. And of course, I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[04:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17881.72s)]
*  Now, tokenization, first, it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have a discussion like this. [[04:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17896.600000000002s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[04:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17906.48s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions and the financial systems in general. [[04:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17912.48s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions, they can make very important contribution. [[04:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17924.48s)]
*  First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[04:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17930.36s)]
*  The most, where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with payments and well, obviously, currencies. [[04:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17936.36s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[04:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17946.36s)]
*  Now, today, if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[04:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17950.24s)]
*  And it certainly would be good to make them far simpler. [[04:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17960.24s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[04:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17965.24s)]
*  Today, for example, when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation and settlement. [[04:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17969.24s)]
*  Given that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially on KYC, AML CFD. [[04:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17978.120000000003s)]
*  If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[04:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17987.120000000003s)]
*  And this can be applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. [[04:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=17994.120000000003s)]
*  In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is to put everything, [[05:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18000.0s)]
*  all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation and so on, in a contained chip, I would say, [[05:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18011.0s)]
*  that would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that many of them, for example, we don't do today. [[05:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18021.88s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, [[05:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18031.88s)]
*  the development of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application [[05:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18038.88s)]
*  because we don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[05:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18045.88s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this, and therefore tokenization can really be the future of a financial system [[05:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18050.760000000002s)]
*  with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[05:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18061.760000000002s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that [[05:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18064.760000000002s)]
*  it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[05:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18073.64s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. [[05:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18080.64s)]
*  And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, which is the identity of people, [[05:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18083.64s)]
*  and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. [[05:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18092.64s)]
*  Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated, [[05:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18098.52s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being of the different nations. [[05:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18105.52s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant, [[05:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18114.52s)]
*  and that's why we are supporting this fully at the BIS. [[05:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18122.4s)]
*  Now one can ask, make the following question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization? [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18128.4s)]
*  And I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts are isolated. [[05:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18138.4s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[05:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18147.280000000002s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here in London, we'll speak later, I also will speak later about it. [[05:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18155.280000000002s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of the ECB, [[05:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18162.280000000002s)]
*  you're trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, [[05:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18169.280000000002s)]
*  and to have a joint vision to promote this. [[05:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18175.16s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices, [[05:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18179.16s)]
*  and we can go from individual innovations and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. [[05:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18185.16s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the BIS Innovation Hub. [[05:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18197.16s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects, many of them do not fit together, [[05:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18201.04s)]
*  but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together and how can we use a platform [[05:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18209.04s)]
*  that can invite more private sector participation and make the system work as a whole. [[05:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18215.04s)]
*  In terms of the, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[05:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18221.04s)]
*  For example, one is Agora, which is a first effort, major effort, [[05:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18227.920000000002s)]
*  where we're working with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks, [[05:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18234.920000000002s)]
*  to really streamline dramatically cross-border payments. [[05:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18239.920000000002s)]
*  And this works based on the organization, the enthusiasm is great, [[05:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18243.920000000002s)]
*  and this could be a major platform to really make cross-border payments extremely efficient. [[05:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18249.920000000002s)]
*  And again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[05:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18257.920000000002s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[05:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18263.920000000002s)]
*  And Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important [[05:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18266.920000000002s)]
*  for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC [[05:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18275.920000000002s)]
*  in the way that Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money [[05:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18282.8s)]
*  and government securities in tokenized fashion. [[05:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18288.8s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way [[05:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18293.8s)]
*  to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18299.8s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[05:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18302.8s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization [[05:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18307.68s)]
*  to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[05:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18313.68s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[05:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18318.68s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, [[05:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18324.68s)]
*  for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. [[05:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18332.68s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[05:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18335.56s)]
*  You would have to access Internet through a different device. [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18340.56s)]
*  You would have a different phone. You would have your camera. [[05:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18344.56s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[05:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18348.56s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[05:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18353.56s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough [[05:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18358.56s)]
*  and the important thing is that technology is there. [[05:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18364.440000000002s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[05:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18368.440000000002s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, [[05:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18372.440000000002s)]
*  coordination, the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[05:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18378.440000000002s)]
*  I can comment more about that later, but in any case, [[05:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18386.440000000002s)]
*  I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[05:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18390.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustín. [[05:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18395.32s)]
*  It's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions [[05:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18397.32s)]
*  and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that [[05:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18408.32s)]
*  that is the current juncture in many aspects. [[05:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18414.2s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustín on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[05:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18421.2s)]
*  So, a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as the Internet. [[05:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18431.2s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet existing [[05:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18441.08s)]
*  and nowadays it is everywhere. [[05:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18448.08s)]
*  And I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services [[05:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18450.08s)]
*  we could have such a seamless object. [[05:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18457.08s)]
*  So, explain a little bit more your thinking around that [[05:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18462.08s)]
*  and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[05:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18465.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18471.960000000003s)]
*  I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades [[05:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18473.960000000003s)]
*  and we have seen that whether it's in banking, the branch, [[05:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18480.960000000003s)]
*  you now go to a mobile phone app, payments are becoming instant, [[05:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18484.960000000003s)]
*  you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[05:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18489.960000000003s)]
*  So, clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services. [[05:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18493.84s)]
*  But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, [[05:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18500.84s)]
*  purpose specific infrastructure with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance [[05:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18504.84s)]
*  and clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. [[05:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18510.84s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization [[05:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18514.84s)]
*  is that it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things, [[05:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18518.72s)]
*  it's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, [[05:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18523.72s)]
*  portable and interoperable from day one. [[05:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18529.72s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[05:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18532.72s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Finternet came in. [[05:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18536.72s)]
*  The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization, [[05:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18539.72s)]
*  many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency, [[05:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18545.600000000002s)]
*  countries are talking about stable coins, some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[05:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18549.600000000002s)]
*  So we are seeing a lot of work happening, [[05:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18555.600000000002s)]
*  but if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time [[05:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18558.600000000002s)]
*  to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[05:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18563.600000000002s)]
*  And the idea of the Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore [[05:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18567.600000000002s)]
*  on the G20 meeting in February of 2023 [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18574.48s)]
*  and he had been writing about this new financial architecture [[05:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18577.48s)]
*  and my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth and myself had been working on [[05:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18583.48s)]
*  population scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[05:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18589.48s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization [[05:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18595.48s)]
*  and that's how was born the idea of the Finternet. [[05:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18603.36s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 [[05:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18607.36s)]
*  and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[05:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18612.36s)]
*  Now what we are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. [[05:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18617.36s)]
*  So basically there are three important ways we look at it. [[05:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18627.36s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user-centric. [[05:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18631.24s)]
*  It's not about institutions, it's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user [[05:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18635.24s)]
*  where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[05:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18643.24s)]
*  So user-centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Finternet. [[05:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18649.24s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[05:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18653.24s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, [[05:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18661.24s)]
*  they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[05:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18669.24s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[05:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18672.24s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography [[05:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18678.24s)]
*  but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[05:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18682.24s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[05:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18688.24s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, [[05:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18691.24s)]
*  then we're at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[05:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18695.24s)]
*  Now it's exactly a year since we released this paper, it was April of 24, [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18703.24s)]
*  and a lot has happened since then. [[05:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18708.24s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[05:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18711.24s)]
*  We thought it was experimental but we believe it's more mature. [[05:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18715.24s)]
*  Then second is that all of the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[05:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18718.120000000003s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[05:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18727.120000000003s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[05:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18730.120000000003s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[05:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18736.120000000003s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this Finternet would look like, [[05:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18740.120000000003s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[05:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18746.0s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[05:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18749.0s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. [[05:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18753.0s)]
*  But we're not ready to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[05:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18763.0s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[05:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18768.0s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months by the end of, by December of this year, [[05:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18773.88s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[05:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18779.88s)]
*  And these are in multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. [[05:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18783.88s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the Finternet approach. [[05:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18790.88s)]
*  And if we can work with making it user centric, universal and unified, [[05:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18797.760000000002s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[05:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18803.760000000002s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[05:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18809.760000000002s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[05:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18812.760000000002s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. [[05:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18818.760000000002s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[05:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18822.760000000002s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[05:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18825.64s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[05:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18830.64s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[05:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18832.64s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for that insight. [[05:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18840.64s)]
*  Let me turn back to Piero and, you know, ask about the broader capital market implications. [[05:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18844.64s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that and Michelle as well. [[05:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18854.52s)]
*  So how do you see sort of like, you know, how what central banks are doing on tokenization [[05:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18864.52s)]
*  linked to the broader capital market developments, you know, that are, you know, oftentimes beyond the normal operation [[05:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18874.52s)]
*  or the international reach of central banks? [[05:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18884.52s)]
*  So, you know, this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[05:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18887.52s)]
*  You know, we come from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[05:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18894.52s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[05:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18899.52s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[05:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18903.52s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[05:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18906.52s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market, you know, in this condition, fragmentation is a high cost. [[05:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18910.4s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[05:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18919.4s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[05:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18922.4s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing, you know, a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization [[05:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18926.4s)]
*  as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a financial capital, [[05:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18939.280000000002s)]
*  unified financial capital markets in Europe. [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18947.280000000002s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension, right? [[05:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18950.280000000002s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT, I think, can be clustered into groups. [[05:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18956.280000000002s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. [[05:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18962.16s)]
*  And those are the low-hanging fruit. [[05:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18970.16s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[05:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18973.16s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[05:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18976.16s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[05:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18985.16s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[05:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18989.04s)]
*  So basically we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[05:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=18998.04s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody [[05:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19007.04s)]
*  are done on the three different platforms. [[05:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19015.920000000002s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[05:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19018.920000000002s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[05:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19023.920000000002s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, right? [[05:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19029.920000000002s)]
*  Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[05:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19035.920000000002s)]
*  So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. [[05:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19041.8s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new services. [[05:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19049.8s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[05:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19060.8s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[05:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19064.8s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file. [[05:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19067.68s)]
*  A very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[05:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19071.68s)]
*  So on a file you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, how to pay, condition alone, all possible state of the world. [[05:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19074.68s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service easier. [[05:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19085.68s)]
*  And the financial sector to a different stage. [[05:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19097.68s)]
*  But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. [[05:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19100.68s)]
*  It's a bumpy road. And many things can go wrong. [[05:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19103.68s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way. [[05:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19106.68s)]
*  Because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[05:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19111.68s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low. [[05:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19114.68s)]
*  And we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[05:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19118.68s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, and makes sure that innovation stays at the infrastructure level. [[05:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19125.56s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[05:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19136.56s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[05:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19138.56s)]
*  And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[05:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19140.56s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[05:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19146.440000000002s)]
*  From the nun we heard, a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[05:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19156.440000000002s)]
*  So, Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[05:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19166.440000000002s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[05:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19174.32s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[05:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19179.32s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, to innovation? [[05:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19182.32s)]
*  And as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector. [[05:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19194.32s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. [[05:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19201.32s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[05:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19203.2s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[05:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19206.2s)]
*  I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[05:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19213.2s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money. [[05:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19215.2s)]
*  But I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[05:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19218.2s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[05:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19221.2s)]
*  We issue bank notes. [[05:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19226.2s)]
*  We're all operating RTGS systems. [[05:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19228.2s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, [[05:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19231.08s)]
*  which are a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[05:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19237.08s)]
*  So, against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this [[05:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19241.08s)]
*  and work with the commercial sector. [[05:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19246.08s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[05:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19249.08s)]
*  So, it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[05:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19252.08s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[05:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19255.08s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[05:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19257.960000000003s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in public policy's interests as well. [[05:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19263.960000000003s)]
*  Because these things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy [[05:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19272.960000000003s)]
*  for all the reasons we've spoken about. [[05:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19278.960000000003s)]
*  So, there is a very big public policy interest in this as well. [[05:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19280.960000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what central banks can bring to this. [[05:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19283.960000000003s)]
*  So, in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves [[05:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19286.84s)]
*  as we go through these exercises are, for example, [[05:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19292.84s)]
*  how will this innovation promote or be consistent with monetary and financial stability? [[05:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19295.84s)]
*  Because that's obviously important to us. [[05:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19301.84s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes? [[05:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19304.84s)]
*  And how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[05:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19310.72s)]
*  So, I think these are really important questions, [[05:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19316.72s)]
*  and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[05:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19318.72s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, [[05:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19321.72s)]
*  I think we'll be completely behind the curve. [[05:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19327.72s)]
*  And we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[05:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19330.72s)]
*  So, for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that [[05:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19333.72s)]
*  settlement in central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[05:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19338.600000000002s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is. [[05:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19342.600000000002s)]
*  And a lot of our high-value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. [[05:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19344.600000000002s)]
*  So, if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation [[05:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19351.600000000002s)]
*  might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it. [[05:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19359.600000000002s)]
*  And that mightn't have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[05:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19364.48s)]
*  So, again, we think we're not going to drive this, [[05:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19370.48s)]
*  we're not going to tell people what to do, [[05:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19374.48s)]
*  but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, [[05:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19376.48s)]
*  how central bank money might be used in these circumstances [[05:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19379.48s)]
*  and what the policy implications might be of that. [[05:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19385.48s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making, [[05:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19389.36s)]
*  is that other regulatory authorities, for example, prudential regulators, [[05:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19393.36s)]
*  consumer regulators and the government are also potentially interested [[05:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19397.36s)]
*  in all these issues as well. [[05:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19402.36s)]
*  So, we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, [[05:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19404.36s)]
*  the breadth of our stakeholders. [[05:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19408.36s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks. [[05:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19410.36s)]
*  And they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them more [[05:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19413.36s)]
*  comfortable in their own work. [[05:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19419.36s)]
*  So, that's how I see our role. [[05:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19421.36s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[05:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19424.36s)]
*  And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine [[05:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19426.36s)]
*  and ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. [[05:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19432.36s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, [[05:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19439.36s)]
*  but they're also broader issues around governance and legal certainty, [[05:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19443.24s)]
*  which are extremely important across countries. [[05:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19453.24s)]
*  So, how do you see that playing out across countries [[05:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19456.24s)]
*  and not just advanced economies, [[05:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19462.24s)]
*  but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[05:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19464.24s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination, cooperation, [[05:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19468.24s)]
*  internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, nationally. [[05:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19472.120000000003s)]
*  Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19478.120000000003s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role. [[05:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19482.120000000003s)]
*  But also how to engage with the private sector. [[05:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19485.120000000003s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, [[05:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19489.120000000003s)]
*  whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. [[05:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19492.120000000003s)]
*  Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation [[05:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19496.0s)]
*  and to steer the participation of the private sector [[05:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19502.0s)]
*  in a more coherent fashion. [[05:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19505.0s)]
*  What we see in technology is that they are very big players, [[05:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19507.0s)]
*  they tend to dominate the game, [[05:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19512.0s)]
*  and we can end up with walled gardens, [[05:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19516.0s)]
*  where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. [[05:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19519.0s)]
*  So, we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, [[05:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19522.88s)]
*  the resources of the private sector, [[05:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19526.88s)]
*  but in a way that brings together an efficient, [[05:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19528.88s)]
*  competitive financial system open to everybody. [[05:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19532.88s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar [[05:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19535.88s)]
*  is to preserve and to make this system grow [[05:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19539.88s)]
*  out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[05:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19543.88s)]
*  I don't think it's old-fashioned, [[05:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19549.760000000002s)]
*  I think it's essential to have the trust that central banks bring in itself, [[05:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19552.760000000002s)]
*  which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. [[05:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19558.760000000002s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[05:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19564.760000000002s)]
*  So, given these two conditions, [[05:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19572.760000000002s)]
*  one that we need to sort of steer the participation of the private sector [[05:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19574.64s)]
*  and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? [[05:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19579.64s)]
*  Again, let me emphasize, number one, [[05:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19584.64s)]
*  we need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly [[05:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19589.64s)]
*  what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[05:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19594.64s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, [[05:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19601.52s)]
*  but we need to try to bring that picture together. [[05:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19605.52s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, [[05:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19609.52s)]
*  we need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. [[05:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19613.52s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues [[05:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19617.52s)]
*  like the status of tokenized assets, data privacy, [[05:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19621.52s)]
*  the legal enforceability of smart contracts [[05:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19625.52s)]
*  and the relationship between tokenized assets [[05:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19628.4s)]
*  and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[05:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19631.4s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between, [[05:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19634.4s)]
*  not only across jurisdictions, [[05:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19639.4s)]
*  but between traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[05:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19642.4s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the AML-CFT and KYC. [[05:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19646.4s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities [[05:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19652.4s)]
*  should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. [[05:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19657.280000000002s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, [[05:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19661.280000000002s)]
*  so it's not an additional ask of what we do today already. [[05:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19664.280000000002s)]
*  Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[05:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19669.280000000002s)]
*  So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, [[05:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19676.280000000002s)]
*  tokenized deposits and tokenized government bonds, [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19680.280000000002s)]
*  and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[05:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19685.16s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, [[05:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19691.16s)]
*  basically how to connect the unified layers [[05:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19699.16s)]
*  to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[05:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19703.16s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[05:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19709.16s)]
*  I think that is essential. [[05:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19713.04s)]
*  I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[05:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19716.04s)]
*  Most of it, I would say, is there, [[05:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19720.04s)]
*  but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[05:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19723.04s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing [[05:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19727.04s)]
*  will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals, [[05:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19730.04s)]
*  and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[05:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19735.04s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, [[05:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19739.920000000002s)]
*  well, that's what the BIS is there for. [[05:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19742.920000000002s)]
*  I mean, we are the bank of the central banks. [[05:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19745.920000000002s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this [[05:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19748.920000000002s)]
*  is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[05:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19753.920000000002s)]
*  I mean, we don't have a life on our own. [[05:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19758.920000000002s)]
*  We respond to the needs of the central banks, [[05:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19762.920000000002s)]
*  to the expression of interest. [[05:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19765.920000000002s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope [[05:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19767.8s)]
*  is more than anything of an expression of the interest [[05:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19770.8s)]
*  and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[05:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19776.8s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[05:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19782.8s)]
*  And I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, [[05:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19788.8s)]
*  your capacity development and so on, [[05:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19796.68s)]
*  can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[05:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19800.68s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. [[05:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19807.68s)]
*  So one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT. [[05:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19810.68s)]
*  So, Nandan, how do you think about the public and private sector [[05:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19818.68s)]
*  interplay and more specifically, [[05:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19825.56s)]
*  on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19829.56s)]
*  and privacy, which is foundational for money. [[05:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19835.56s)]
*  But on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, [[05:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19840.56s)]
*  EMLCFT compliance. [[05:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19844.56s)]
*  So how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[05:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19846.56s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, [[05:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19852.440000000002s)]
*  we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector [[05:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19854.440000000002s)]
*  in framing the rules of the game, [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19859.440000000002s)]
*  in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. [[05:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19861.440000000002s)]
*  And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, [[05:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19866.440000000002s)]
*  then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[05:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19870.440000000002s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, [[05:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19874.440000000002s)]
*  because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[05:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19877.32s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, [[05:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19882.32s)]
*  which is what we are doing, which is creating internet labs across the world, [[05:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19885.32s)]
*  the US, Europe, India and Singapore, [[05:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19890.32s)]
*  and building the composable building blocks to make this happen [[05:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19893.32s)]
*  so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization in the real world. [[05:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19898.32s)]
*  And I think over the next few years, [[05:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19903.2s)]
*  if we really put our hearts and minds on it, [[05:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19906.2s)]
*  we can actually see significant progress. [[05:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19908.2s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this, [[05:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19910.2s)]
*  because this has such enormous value for society, [[05:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19914.2s)]
*  such enormous value for inclusion, [[05:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19917.2s)]
*  such enormous value for economic progress, [[05:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19920.2s)]
*  that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[05:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19923.2s)]
*  And we are on this journey, [[05:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19926.2s)]
*  and anybody can join us if they want on the Fintanet journey. [[05:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19928.2s)]
*  So please, we are welcome. [[05:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19931.08s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. [[05:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19935.08s)]
*  So this is the end of this fascinating panel. [[05:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19937.08s)]
*  I think there are many topics to explore. [[05:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19939.08s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustin particularly for his long service [[05:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19942.08s)]
*  in the international community. [[05:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19946.08s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings [[05:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19949.08s)]
*  in official capacity, [[05:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19954.08s)]
*  but we are all looking forward to working with you [[05:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19956.08s)]
*  in your next chapter. [[05:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19957.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists, [[05:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19959.960000000003s)]
*  and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[05:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19961.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19963.960000000003s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, [[05:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19965.960000000003s)]
*  we have been observing that there is a growing interest [[05:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19967.960000000003s)]
*  from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT [[05:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19969.960000000003s)]
*  can play a role in improving the capital [[05:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19971.960000000003s)]
*  and the market. [[05:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19974.960000000003s)]
*  And I think that this is a very important topic. [[05:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19976.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19978.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19980.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19982.960000000003s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19984.960000000003s)]
*  I think that DLT plays a role in improving the current situation [[05:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19986.84s)]
*  of financial market, [[05:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19988.84s)]
*  essentially because DLT and tokenization [[05:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19990.84s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets [[05:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19992.84s)]
*  in a digital form, [[05:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19994.84s)]
*  and this allows many new developments [[05:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19996.84s)]
*  and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[05:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=19998.84s)]
*  We also observed that the Europeans, [[05:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20000.84s)]
*  in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field [[05:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20002.84s)]
*  in the space of the European Union. [[05:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20004.84s)]
*  So I think that this is a very important topic [[05:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20006.84s)]
*  and I think that we can look at it in the next chapter [[05:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20008.84s)]
*  and we can look at it in the next chapter [[05:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20010.84s)]
*  and we can look at it in the next chapter [[05:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20012.84s)]
*  to see how banks are being active in this field, in this space. [[05:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20014.72s)]
*  From our contact with the market, [[05:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20016.72s)]
*  we see that 60% of the banks are interested [[05:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20018.72s)]
*  in experimenting with DLT [[05:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20020.72s)]
*  and actually something like 22% of them [[05:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20022.72s)]
*  have already put in place [[05:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20024.72s)]
*  some sort of application [[05:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20026.72s)]
*  implementing DLT. [[05:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20028.72s)]
*  Also on the security side, [[05:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20030.72s)]
*  we have seen a growing interest [[05:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20032.72s)]
*  in issuing a very important piece [[05:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20036.72s)]
*  on the security side. [[05:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20038.72s)]
*  And I think that this is a very important topic [[05:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20040.72s)]
*  a growing interest in issuing that. [[05:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20041.72s)]
*  We have also at the European level a specific legislation that allows that so this might [[05:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20044.760000000002s)]
*  have improved the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[05:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20049.800000000003s)]
*  So confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space [[05:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20062.760000000002s)]
*  very early on for two fundamental reasons. [[05:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20068.280000000002s)]
*  The one reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody [[05:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20071.56s)]
*  else will be there. [[05:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20076.0s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money but certainly we have to recognize [[05:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20077.48s)]
*  that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk which is near [[05:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20083.48s)]
*  and into commercial bank money so that we need to be there immediately as a central [[05:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20088.640000000003s)]
*  bank money. [[05:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20095.120000000003s)]
*  And the second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[05:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20096.120000000003s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[05:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20100.38s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[05:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20106.18s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, well from November, [[05:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20111.86s)]
*  we launched an experiment, a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[05:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20121.06s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank [[05:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20130.18s)]
*  money. [[05:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20138.86s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the [[05:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20139.86s)]
*  asset transaction on DLT with our target services which is our traditional system. [[05:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20147.58s)]
*  The three central banks of the Euro system, they invented a very interesting solution [[05:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20157.82s)]
*  so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank [[05:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20163.34s)]
*  money in the RTGS basically. [[05:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20169.18s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. [[05:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20172.7s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing [[05:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20175.22s)]
*  interest more than what we were expecting. [[05:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20182.579999999998s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[05:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20185.54s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into [[05:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20188.14s)]
*  production and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability [[05:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20194.58s)]
*  allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central [[05:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20201.54s)]
*  bank money. [[05:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20208.3s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets [[05:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20210.3s)]
*  are. [[05:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20216.66s)]
*  This is for the short term. [[05:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20217.66s)]
*  However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term and here we are open to [[05:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20219.059999999998s)]
*  a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could [[05:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20224.98s)]
*  have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. [[05:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20233.78s)]
*  You know, BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[05:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20239.02s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers [[05:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20244.3s)]
*  which could take care of, you know, could specialize for different use case or adapt [[05:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20251.739999999998s)]
*  to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS [[05:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20257.940000000002s)]
*  to this new solution. [[05:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20266.62s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. [[05:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20269.7s)]
*  More to come. [[05:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20271.78s)]
*  Great. [[05:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20272.78s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[05:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20273.78s)]
*  And let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[05:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20275.82s)]
*  When our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are [[05:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20281.98s)]
*  fairly interchangeable to a first order approximation. [[05:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20289.3s)]
*  So you know, there are some minor differences but, you know, DLT, tokenization and blockchain [[05:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20293.34s)]
*  are more or less the same thing. [[05:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20303.78s)]
*  So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[05:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20306.3s)]
*  its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of [[05:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20314.86s)]
*  working with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial for many [[05:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20323.7s)]
*  countries around the world. [[05:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20332.34s)]
*  And you have been particularly working on tokenization, you know, with central banks [[05:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20334.38s)]
*  but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. [[05:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20338.98s)]
*  So where are you, you know, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking [[05:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20343.1s)]
*  today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and so like the future [[05:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20348.58s)]
*  of tokenization and finance? [[05:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20355.26s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[05:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20358.54s)]
*  Thank you very much, Tobi. [[05:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20360.62s)]
*  I say it's great to be in this panel. [[05:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20361.62s)]
*  We have two very distinguished central bankers, Michelle Piero and the tremendously dynamic [[05:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20364.539999999997s)]
*  entrepreneur thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[05:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20370.34s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[05:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20378.26s)]
*  And of course I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because [[05:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20382.14s)]
*  he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[05:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20387.5s)]
*  Now, tokenization, first it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[05:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20393.14s)]
*  a discussion like this. [[05:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20400.98s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[05:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20402.78s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[05:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20409.22s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. [[05:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20417.899999999998s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions they can make very important contribution. [[05:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20420.86s)]
*  First it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[05:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20427.18s)]
*  The most, where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with [[05:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20432.74s)]
*  payments and well obviously currencies. [[05:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20439.62s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[05:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20442.9s)]
*  Now today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[05:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20446.62s)]
*  complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[05:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20452.5s)]
*  And it certainly would be good to make them far simpler. [[05:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20457.46s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[05:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20462.219999999998s)]
*  Today for example when you do a payment usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation [[05:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20465.579999999998s)]
*  and settlement. [[05:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20472.7s)]
*  Given that separation many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially on [[05:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20473.7s)]
*  KYC, AML, CFD. [[05:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20479.14s)]
*  If you integrate everything the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[05:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20482.98s)]
*  And this can be applied not only for payments but for many other financial transactions. [[05:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20489.940000000002s)]
*  In that sense tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is [[05:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20496.780000000002s)]
*  to put everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation and so on in a [[05:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20503.780000000002s)]
*  contained chip I would say that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[05:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20513.780000000002s)]
*  to the point that many of them for example we don't do today. [[05:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20522.74s)]
*  I mean traditionally if you have a discussion among economists many contingent, the development [[05:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20528.58s)]
*  of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we [[05:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20536.34s)]
*  don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[05:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20542.5s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this and therefore tokenization can really be the [[05:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20547.86s)]
*  future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[05:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20554.620000000003s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact [[05:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20561.58s)]
*  that it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[05:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20569.46s)]
*  India for example is a great example and through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen [[05:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20578.100000000002s)]
*  which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an [[05:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20584.46s)]
*  unmistakable way. [[05:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20593.1s)]
*  Really what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated [[05:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20595.66s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being [[05:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20601.899999999998s)]
*  of the different nations. [[05:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20608.379999999997s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant and that's why we are [[05:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20611.820000000003s)]
*  supporting this fully at the PIS. [[05:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20620.300000000003s)]
*  Now one can ask, make the following question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow [[05:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20624.620000000003s)]
*  in tokenization and I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts but [[05:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20632.300000000003s)]
*  those efforts are isolated. [[05:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20641.26s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate [[05:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20643.82s)]
*  that. [[05:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20650.78s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here, Nandan will speak later, I also will speak [[05:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20651.78s)]
*  later about it. [[05:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20656.78s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCV you're [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20658.179999999997s)]
*  trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets and to have a [[05:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20665.18s)]
*  joint vision to promote this. [[05:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20671.98s)]
*  If we have this vision that would allow coordination devices and we can go from individual innovations [[05:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20675.42s)]
*  and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. [[05:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20685.1s)]
*  In a way that's what we're trying to do at the VIES Innovation Hub. [[05:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20693.62s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[05:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20697.899999999998s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together [[05:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20703.46s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation and make [[05:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20709.18s)]
*  the system work as a whole. [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20715.26s)]
*  In terms of the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[05:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20717.54s)]
*  For example, one is AGORA, which is a first effort, major effort where we're working with [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20724.34s)]
*  40 commercial banks, seven central banks to really streamline dramatically cross border [[05:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20732.46s)]
*  payments. [[05:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20738.66s)]
*  This works based on the key station. [[05:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20739.9s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great and this could be a major platform to really make cross border [[05:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20743.82s)]
*  payments extremely efficient. [[05:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20751.14s)]
*  Again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[05:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20753.26s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[05:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20760.34s)]
*  Project Pine basically uses, I would say the trilogy that I find that is important [[05:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20763.86s)]
*  for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way [[05:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20771.38s)]
*  that Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money and government securities in tokenized [[05:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20779.100000000002s)]
*  fashion. [[05:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20788.62s)]
*  Here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate [[05:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20789.86s)]
*  implementation of monetary policy. [[05:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20796.46s)]
*  Even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[05:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20799.5s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift [[05:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20803.98s)]
*  the boundaries of the financial system. [[05:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20812.379999999997s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[05:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20816.62s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what [[05:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20821.3s)]
*  in telecommunications was achieved. [[05:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20829.46s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[05:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20832.18s)]
*  You would have to access internet through a different device. [[05:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20836.78s)]
*  You would have a different phone. [[05:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20841.26s)]
*  You would have your camera. [[05:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20843.26s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[05:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20845.1s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[05:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20850.26s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[05:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20854.82s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[05:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20861.34s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[05:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20864.42s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, the provision [[05:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20868.42s)]
*  of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[05:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20878.059999999998s)]
*  I can comment more about that later, but in any case, I think that the tokenization has [[05:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20882.14s)]
*  a big promise into the future. [[05:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20888.579999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustín. [[05:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20891.98s)]
*  That's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, and [[05:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20896.3s)]
*  then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that. [[05:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20904.94s)]
*  That is the current juncture in many aspects. [[05:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20912.059999999998s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustín on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[05:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20917.98s)]
*  So, a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as the internet. [[05:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20927.54s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet existing, and [[05:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20938.58s)]
*  nowadays it is everywhere. [[05:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20944.18s)]
*  I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services [[05:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20947.94s)]
*  we could have such a seamless object. [[05:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20953.22s)]
*  So explain a little bit more your thinking around that, and particularly this intersection [[05:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20958.7s)]
*  between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[05:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20964.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20968.98s)]
*  I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades, and we have [[05:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20970.58s)]
*  seen that, whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, payments [[05:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20977.460000000003s)]
*  are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[05:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20984.18s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial [[05:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20989.460000000003s)]
*  services. [[05:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20995.940000000002s)]
*  All these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose specific infrastructure with their [[05:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=20998.06s)]
*  own applications, their own data, their own maintenance, and clearly we have to think [[05:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21003.140000000003s)]
*  about doing some things differently. [[05:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21008.420000000002s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just [[05:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21011.18s)]
*  digitizing the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation where money and [[05:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21017.18s)]
*  assets are programmable, portable, and interoperable from day one. [[05:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21024.3s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[05:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21029.1s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Fintanet came in. [[05:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21033.539999999997s)]
*  The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[05:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21037.219999999998s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[05:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21043.019999999997s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. [[05:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21047.34s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[05:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21048.859999999997s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[05:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21052.04s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount [[05:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21054.34s)]
*  of time to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[05:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21058.48s)]
*  And the idea of the Fintanet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 [[05:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21064.84s)]
*  meeting in February of 2023, and he had been writing about the Fintanet, writing about [[05:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21071.32s)]
*  this new financial architecture. [[05:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21078.18s)]
*  And my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population [[05:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21080.62s)]
*  scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[05:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21086.3s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to [[05:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21092.38s)]
*  tokenization? [[05:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21098.46s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Fintanet. [[05:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21100.420000000002s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 and actually published [[05:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21104.1s)]
*  the paper only in April of 24. [[05:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21109.859999999997s)]
*  Now what we are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across [[05:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21114.379999999997s)]
*  the world. [[05:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21122.46s)]
*  So basically there are three important ways we look at it. [[05:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21123.76s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user centric. [[05:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21127.98s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[05:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21132.58s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user can [[05:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21134.58s)]
*  buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[05:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21140.100000000002s)]
*  So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Fintanet. [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21145.5s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[05:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21150.34s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever [[05:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21157.62s)]
*  it is, bonds, they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[05:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21163.1s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[05:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21168.66s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, but to create a universal [[05:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21174.26s)]
*  infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[05:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21180.14s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[05:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21184.12s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, then we're at least creating a vision [[05:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21186.82s)]
*  of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[05:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21192.54s)]
*  Now it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[05:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21198.739999999998s)]
*  It was April of 24. [[05:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21202.22s)]
*  And a lot has happened since then. [[05:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21204.3s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[05:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21207.38s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[05:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21211.18s)]
*  And second is that all over the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create [[05:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21214.84s)]
*  a framework for having tokenized assets. [[05:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21219.32s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[05:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21223.760000000002s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[05:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21227.0s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[05:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21232.82s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, how you [[05:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21236.8s)]
*  do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[05:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21242.82s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[05:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21245.78s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction [[05:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21249.78s)]
*  level using public chain technology. [[05:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21256.14s)]
*  But we're not wedded to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[05:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21259.92s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[05:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21264.62s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of December of this year, [[05:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21270.78s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21275.86s)]
*  And these are in multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers, and so on. [[05:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21280.98s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the internet approach. [[05:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21287.539999999997s)]
*  If we can work with making it user-centric, universal, and unified, we're really going [[05:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21295.26s)]
*  to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[05:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21301.02s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[05:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21306.22s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be [[05:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21309.1s)]
*  the challenge. [[05:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21313.78s)]
*  Technology will be available. [[05:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21315.7s)]
*  It will be available as open source. [[05:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21316.7s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[05:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21319.42s)]
*  We're still able to apply it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[05:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21321.98s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[05:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21326.899999999998s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much [[05:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21329.02s)]
*  faster. [[05:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21334.78s)]
*  Great. [[05:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21335.78s)]
*  Thanks so much for that insight. [[05:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21336.78s)]
*  Let me turn back to Piero and ask about the broader capital market implications. [[05:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21341.82s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that, and Michelle as well. [[05:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21350.66s)]
*  So how do you see what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital [[05:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21360.98s)]
*  developments that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[05:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21372.78s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[05:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21384.02s)]
*  We came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[05:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21391.539999999997s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[05:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21395.62s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[05:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21400.260000000002s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[05:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21403.06s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[05:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21407.78s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[05:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21414.02s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[05:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21417.14s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[05:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21419.46s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based [[05:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21424.02s)]
*  on tokenization as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the [[05:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21434.420000000002s)]
*  backbone of a unified financial capital market in Europe. [[05:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21441.38s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. [[05:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21447.06s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT, I think can be clustered in two groups. [[05:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21452.82s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more [[05:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21459.54s)]
*  efficient way. [[05:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21465.62s)]
*  And those are the low-hanging fruit. [[05:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21467.14s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[05:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21469.78s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat [[05:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21472.22s)]
*  money? [[05:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21480.7s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[05:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21482.02s)]
*  For just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[05:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21485.38s)]
*  So basically, we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[05:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21494.5s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, [[05:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21504.74s)]
*  the custody are done on the three different platforms. [[05:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21510.9s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[05:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21515.7s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[05:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21519.780000000002s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, through digitalization, [[05:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21526.74s)]
*  through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[05:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21533.38s)]
*  So all this, at the end of the day, would reduce costs and make it a more efficient [[05:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21538.18s)]
*  market. [[05:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21544.82s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new [[05:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21545.82s)]
*  services. [[05:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21555.7s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[05:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21556.7s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[05:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21561.06s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file. [[05:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21565.38s)]
*  A very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[05:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21568.980000000003s)]
*  So on a file, you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, [[05:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21572.38s)]
*  how to pay, conditional on all possible states of the world. [[05:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21578.02s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial [[05:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21582.7s)]
*  service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[05:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21592.58s)]
*  But let me conclude. [[05:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21596.100000000002s)]
*  This is not an easy road. [[05:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21597.100000000002s)]
*  It's a bumpy road. [[05:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21598.620000000003s)]
*  And many things can go wrong. [[06:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21600.3s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[06:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21602.58s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low. [[06:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21610.3s)]
*  And we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for [[06:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21614.3s)]
*  a long time. [[06:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21620.38s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, and makes sure that [[06:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21621.46s)]
*  innovation stays hard even at the infrastructure level. [[06:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21627.82s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[06:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21631.98s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[06:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21634.66s)]
*  And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[06:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21635.82s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[06:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21642.34s)]
*  From the nun we heard a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[06:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21652.54s)]
*  So Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[06:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21662.02s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[06:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21671.14s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[06:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21676.1s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning [[06:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21679.46s)]
*  to innovation? [[06:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21688.539999999997s)]
*  And as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector. [[06:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21690.899999999998s)]
*  Thanks Tobias. [[06:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21698.1s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[06:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21700.58s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape [[06:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21703.9s)]
*  the future of money. [[06:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21707.940000000002s)]
*  Now I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[06:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21708.940000000002s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money. [[06:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21711.38s)]
*  But I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[06:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21714.3s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[06:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21718.14s)]
*  We issue bank notes. [[06:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21722.54s)]
*  We're all operating RTGS systems. [[06:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21724.98s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are [[06:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21727.74s)]
*  a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[06:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21732.9s)]
*  So against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in [[06:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21737.980000000003s)]
*  this and work with the commercial sector. [[06:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21741.58s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[06:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21745.34s)]
*  So it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[06:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21747.620000000003s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[06:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21751.300000000003s)]
*  I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[06:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21755.22s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in public policy's interests as well. [[06:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21760.58s)]
*  These things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all [[06:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21770.18s)]
*  the reasons we've spoken about. [[06:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21775.300000000003s)]
*  So there is a very big public policy interest in this as well. [[06:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21776.780000000002s)]
*  I think that's what central banks can bring to this. [[06:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21779.98s)]
*  So in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as [[06:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21783.96s)]
*  we go through these exercises are, for example, how will this innovation promote or be consistent [[06:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21788.96s)]
*  with monetary and financial stability, because that's obviously important to us. [[06:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21796.12s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes, and how will they [[06:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21802.2s)]
*  promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[06:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21807.719999999998s)]
*  So I think these are really important questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[06:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21812.72s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I think [[06:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21818.960000000003s)]
*  we'll be completely behind the curve, and we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[06:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21824.04s)]
*  So for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central [[06:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21829.84s)]
*  bank money is the safest way to do it. [[06:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21835.4s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is, and a lot of our high-value systems at the moment, they [[06:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21838.8s)]
*  settle in central bank money. [[06:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21844.559999999998s)]
*  So if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you [[06:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21848.359999999997s)]
*  might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it, and that mightn't have good [[06:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21857.079999999998s)]
*  results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[06:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21862.399999999998s)]
*  So again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what [[06:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21867.58s)]
*  to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money might [[06:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21872.54s)]
*  be used in these circumstances, and what the policy implications might be of that. [[06:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21879.5s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, [[06:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21887.5s)]
*  for example, prudential regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also potentially [[06:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21892.58s)]
*  interested in all these issues as well. [[06:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21899.02s)]
*  So we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[06:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21900.9s)]
*  Ultimately these sorts of things are networks, and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating [[06:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21906.420000000002s)]
*  in order to make them work. [[06:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21913.9s)]
*  So that's how I see our role. [[06:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21915.5s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michel. [[06:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21919.3s)]
*  Leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, cooperation [[06:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21923.3s)]
*  across countries. [[06:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21930.98s)]
*  Of course, Michel mentioned settlement issues, but there are also broader issues around governance [[06:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21934.14s)]
*  and legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. [[06:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21946.82s)]
*  So how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, [[06:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21952.739999999998s)]
*  but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[06:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21959.82s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21963.14s)]
*  I would say at the beginning, nationally. [[06:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21970.62s)]
*  Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21973.780000000002s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role. [[06:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21977.58s)]
*  But also how to engage with the private sector. [[06:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21981.620000000003s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be [[06:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21985.08s)]
*  the private sector. [[06:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21990.100000000002s)]
*  Now I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private [[06:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=21991.9s)]
*  sector in a more coherent fashion. [[06:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22000.66s)]
*  What we see in technology is that there are very big players, they tend to dominate the [[06:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22003.78s)]
*  game, and we can end up with walled gardens, where you have fragmentation and you don't [[06:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22011.14s)]
*  have a lot of integration. [[06:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22017.02s)]
*  So we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in [[06:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22019.24s)]
*  a way that brings together an efficient, competitive financial system open to everybody. [[06:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22025.34s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system [[06:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22032.34s)]
*  grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[06:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22038.78s)]
*  Pieroculti is old fashioned. [[06:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22046.18s)]
*  I don't think it's old fashioned. [[06:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22047.66s)]
*  I think it's essential is to have the trust that central bank, a central bank brings in [[06:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22048.9s)]
*  itself, which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. [[06:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22055.7s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve the element of trust is essential. [[06:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22061.82s)]
*  So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of [[06:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22069.34s)]
*  the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? [[06:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22074.9s)]
*  Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more [[06:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22082.780000000002s)]
*  clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[06:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22089.780000000002s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture [[06:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22098.780000000002s)]
*  together. [[06:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22104.780000000002s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory [[06:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22106.66s)]
*  framework. [[06:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22112.66s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized [[06:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22113.66s)]
*  assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts and the relationship between [[06:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22119.66s)]
*  tokenized assets and the non-tokenized counterparts. [[06:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22126.66s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, but between [[06:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22130.54s)]
*  traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[06:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22138.54s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the AML CFT and KYC. [[06:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22142.54s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational [[06:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22147.54s)]
*  assets and platforms. [[06:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22156.54s)]
*  This is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we do today [[06:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22159.420000000002s)]
*  already. [[06:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22165.420000000002s)]
*  Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[06:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22166.420000000002s)]
*  Here, I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized government bonds, and [[06:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22172.420000000002s)]
*  to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[06:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22181.420000000002s)]
*  Also, we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to [[06:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22188.3s)]
*  connect the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[06:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22197.3s)]
*  Fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[06:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22205.3s)]
*  I think that is essential. [[06:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22209.3s)]
*  I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[06:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22211.3s)]
*  Most of it, I would say, is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[06:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22217.18s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these [[06:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22222.18s)]
*  four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[06:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22230.18s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. [[06:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22236.18s)]
*  I mean, we are the bank of the central banks. [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22242.18s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the [[06:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22247.06s)]
*  interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[06:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22252.06s)]
*  I mean, we don't have a life on our own. [[06:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22255.06s)]
*  We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. [[06:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22259.06s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest, [[06:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22264.06s)]
*  and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[06:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22273.940000000002s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[06:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22278.940000000002s)]
*  And I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity, [[06:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22284.940000000002s)]
*  and so on, can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[06:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22295.82s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. [[06:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22303.82s)]
*  And so, you know, one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so, Nandan, so how do you [[06:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22306.82s)]
*  think about the public and private sector interplay? [[06:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22318.7s)]
*  And more specifically, on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments and privacy, [[06:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22322.7s)]
*  right, which is foundational for money, but on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, [[06:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22333.7s)]
*  and so how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[06:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22341.58s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the [[06:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22348.58s)]
*  public sector in framing the rules of the game, in the regulations that will govern [[06:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22354.18s)]
*  the tokenization. [[06:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22361.18s)]
*  And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, then market [[06:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22363.18s)]
*  players will innovate and create solutions. [[06:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22367.74s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[06:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22371.14s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating internet [[06:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22378.74s)]
*  labs across the world, the U.S., Europe, India, and Singapore, and building the composable [[06:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22384.02s)]
*  building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization [[06:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22391.74s)]
*  in the real world. [[06:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22397.9s)]
*  And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, we [[06:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22399.100000000002s)]
*  can actually see significant progress, and it's really up to the people in this room [[06:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22403.86s)]
*  to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, such enormous value for [[06:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22409.22s)]
*  conclusions, such enormous value for economic progress, that we have to make every effort [[06:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22415.58s)]
*  to expedite that, and we are on this journey, and anybody can join us if they want on the [[06:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22421.260000000002s)]
*  Finternet journey. [[06:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22425.980000000003s)]
*  So please, we are welcome. [[06:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22426.980000000003s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. [[06:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22429.980000000003s)]
*  So this is the end of this fascinating panel. [[06:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22432.38s)]
*  I think there are many topics to explore. [[06:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22434.940000000002s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international [[06:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22438.06s)]
*  community. [[06:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22444.74s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity, [[06:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22446.260000000002s)]
*  but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[06:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22451.460000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists, and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[06:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22458.260000000002s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22465.26s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in [[06:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22475.34s)]
*  improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[06:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22482.539999999997s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22490.54s)]
*  developments, and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[06:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22498.100000000002s)]
*  And we also observed that the Europeans, in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, [[06:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22504.100000000002s)]
*  in this space. [[06:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22511.86s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we see that 60 percent of the banks are interested in [[06:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22513.58s)]
*  experimenting with DLT, and actually something like 22 percent of them have already put in [[06:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22519.06s)]
*  place some sort of application implementing DLT. [[06:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22526.460000000003s)]
*  Also on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[06:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22535.260000000002s)]
*  We have also at the European level a specific legislation that allows that, so this might [[06:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22541.06s)]
*  improve the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[06:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22550.74s)]
*  So confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space [[06:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22559.06s)]
*  very early on for two fundamental reasons. [[06:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22564.54s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else [[06:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22568.26s)]
*  will be there. [[06:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22572.5s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize [[06:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22573.78s)]
*  that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk, which is near [[06:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22579.78s)]
*  and into commercial bank money, so that we need to be there immediately as a central [[06:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22584.94s)]
*  bank money. [[06:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22591.379999999997s)]
*  And the second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[06:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22592.46s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[06:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22596.7s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[06:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22602.5s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, well from November, [[06:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22607.5s)]
*  we launched an experiment of work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[06:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22617.34s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank [[06:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22624.34s)]
*  money. [[06:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22633.34s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the [[06:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22634.34s)]
*  asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional system. [[06:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22642.34s)]
*  The three central banks of the Euro system, they invented a very interesting solution, [[06:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22650.34s)]
*  so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank [[06:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22657.34s)]
*  money in the RTGS basically. [[06:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22662.34s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. [[06:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22665.34s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing [[06:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22668.34s)]
*  interest, more than what we were expecting. [[06:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22676.34s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[06:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22679.34s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into [[06:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22682.34s)]
*  production, and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability [[06:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22689.34s)]
*  allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central [[06:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22696.34s)]
*  bank money. [[06:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22704.34s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets [[06:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22705.34s)]
*  are. [[06:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22713.34s)]
*  This is for the short term. [[06:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22714.34s)]
*  However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term, and here we are open [[06:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22715.34s)]
*  to a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you [[06:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22720.34s)]
*  could have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. [[06:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22728.34s)]
*  You know, BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this, and this is a possibility. [[06:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22733.34s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers [[06:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22740.34s)]
*  which could take care of, you know, could specialize for different use case or adapt [[06:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22747.34s)]
*  to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS [[06:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22753.34s)]
*  to this new solution. [[06:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22762.34s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. [[06:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22765.34s)]
*  More to come. [[06:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22767.34s)]
*  Great. [[06:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22768.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero, and let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[06:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22769.34s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are [[06:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22777.34s)]
*  fairly interchangeable to first order approximation. [[06:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22785.34s)]
*  So, you know, it is, there are some minor differences, but, you know, DLT, tokenization, [[06:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22789.34s)]
*  and blockchain are more or less the same thing. [[06:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22798.34s)]
*  So, Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active [[06:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22802.34s)]
*  through its innovation hub in particular, but also its other activities at the BIS [[06:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22810.34s)]
*  in terms of working with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial [[06:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22818.34s)]
*  for many countries around the world, and you have been particularly working on tokenization, [[06:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22827.34s)]
*  you know, with central bank, but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. [[06:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22832.34s)]
*  So where are you, you know, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking [[06:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22838.34s)]
*  today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and sort of the future [[06:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22844.34s)]
*  of tokenization and finance? [[06:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22850.34s)]
*  Well, thank you, thank you very much, Tobias. [[06:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22854.34s)]
*  It's great to be in this panel with two very distinguished central bankers, Michelle Piero [[06:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22857.34s)]
*  and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur, thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make [[06:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22862.34s)]
*  things to become reality, and I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan [[06:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22871.34s)]
*  here with us. [[06:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22876.34s)]
*  And of course, I would say Tobias, he's an honorary member of the central banking community [[06:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22877.34s)]
*  because he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[06:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22882.34s)]
*  Now, tokenization, first, it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[06:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22887.34s)]
*  a discussion like this. [[06:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22895.34s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[06:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22898.34s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[06:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22904.34s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. [[06:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22913.34s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions they can make very important contribution. [[06:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22916.34s)]
*  First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[06:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22922.34s)]
*  The most, where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with [[06:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22927.34s)]
*  payments and, well, obviously currencies, but those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[06:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22934.34s)]
*  Now, today, if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[06:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22941.34s)]
*  complex, tremendously cumbersome, and it certainly would behoove us to make them far safer. [[06:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22947.34s)]
*  It would make them far simpler. [[06:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22956.34s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[06:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22958.34s)]
*  Today, for example, when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, [[06:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22961.34s)]
*  reconciliation, and settlement. [[06:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22968.34s)]
*  Given that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially on KYC, [[06:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22970.34s)]
*  AML CFD. [[06:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22977.34s)]
*  When you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured, and this can be [[06:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22979.34s)]
*  applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. [[06:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22987.34s)]
*  In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is to put [[06:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=22992.34s)]
*  everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation, and so on, in a contained chip, [[06:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23002.34s)]
*  I would say, that would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that many of [[06:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23013.34s)]
*  them, for example, we don't do today. [[06:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23020.34s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, the development of [[06:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23024.34s)]
*  contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we don't have a way [[06:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23032.34s)]
*  to put them together and put them into play. [[06:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23039.34s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this, and therefore, tokenization can really be the future of a [[06:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23043.34s)]
*  financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[06:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23052.34s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that it would [[06:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23057.34s)]
*  allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[06:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23067.34s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example, and through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, [[06:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23073.34s)]
*  which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. [[06:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23080.34s)]
*  Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated to something where you [[06:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23090.34s)]
*  really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being of the different nations. [[06:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23099.34s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant, and that's why we are supporting this fully at the BIS. [[06:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23106.34s)]
*  Now, one can ask, make the following question, why the take-up outside crypto has been slow in tokenization, [[06:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23120.34s)]
*  and I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts are isolated. [[06:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23129.34s)]
*  We have not been fully able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[06:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23139.34s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here, and Nanda will speak later. [[06:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23147.34s)]
*  I also will speak later about it. [[06:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23151.34s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of the ECB, [[06:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23153.34s)]
*  you're trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, and to have a joint vision to promote this. [[06:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23160.34s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices, and we can go from individual innovations [[06:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23170.34s)]
*  and making the parts, in a way, work together in a virtuous way. [[06:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23180.34s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the BIS Innovation Hub. [[06:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23188.34s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[06:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23193.34s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together [[06:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23198.34s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation and make the system work as a whole. [[06:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23204.34s)]
*  In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[06:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23212.34s)]
*  For example, one is AGORA, which is a first effort, major effort, where we're working with 40 commercial banks, [[06:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23219.34s)]
*  seven central banks, to really streamline dramatically cross-border payments. [[06:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23229.34s)]
*  This works based on the key station. [[06:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23235.34s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great, and this could be a major platform to really make cross-border payments extremely efficient. [[06:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23238.34s)]
*  Again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[06:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23249.34s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[06:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23255.34s)]
*  Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important for a financial system of the future [[06:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23259.34s)]
*  to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way that Michelle expressed, [[06:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23269.34s)]
*  commercial bank digital money and government securities in tokenized fashion. [[06:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23277.34s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[06:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23285.34s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[06:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23294.34s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[06:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23299.34s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[06:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23311.34s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. [[06:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23316.34s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[06:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23327.34s)]
*  You would have to access Internet through a different device. [[06:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23332.34s)]
*  You would have a different phone. You would have your camera. [[06:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23336.34s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[06:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23340.34s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[06:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23345.34s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[06:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23350.34s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[06:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23356.34s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[06:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23359.34s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, regulation, coordination, the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[06:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23363.34s)]
*  I can comment more about that later. [[06:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23377.34s)]
*  But in any case, I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[06:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23380.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustin. [[06:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23386.34s)]
*  And yes, so, you know, it's really the interplay between innovation, which, you know, may go in different directions and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that. [[06:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23389.34s)]
*  That is the current juncture in many aspects. [[06:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23406.34s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustin on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[06:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23412.34s)]
*  So, you know, a kind of, you know, global payment system that is just as seamless as the Internet. [[06:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23423.34s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet existing, and nowadays it is everywhere. [[06:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23433.34s)]
*  And I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services we could have such a seamless object. [[06:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23441.34s)]
*  So explain a little bit more your thinking around that and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[06:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23453.34s)]
*  Thank you. I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades. [[06:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23462.34s)]
*  And we have seen that, whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, payments are becoming instant. [[06:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23471.34s)]
*  You can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[06:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23480.34s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services. [[06:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23484.34s)]
*  But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose specific infrastructure with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance. [[06:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23492.34s)]
*  And clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. [[06:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23502.34s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things. [[06:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23506.34s)]
*  It's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, portable and interoperable from day one. [[06:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23515.34s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[06:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23524.34s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Finternet came in. [[06:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23528.34s)]
*  The thing is that they have a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[06:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23531.34s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[06:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23537.34s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[06:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23541.34s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[06:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23546.34s)]
*  But if you really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[06:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23549.34s)]
*  And the idea of the Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. [[06:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23559.34s)]
*  And he had been writing about the Finternet, writing about this new financial architecture. [[06:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23568.34s)]
*  And my colleague and I, Pramod Siddharth and myself, had been working on population scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[06:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23575.34s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? [[06:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23587.34s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Finternet. [[06:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23595.34s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[06:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23599.34s)]
*  Now, what we are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. [[06:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23609.34s)]
*  So basically, there are three important ways we look at it. [[06:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23618.34s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user centric. [[06:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23623.34s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[06:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23627.34s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[06:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23629.34s)]
*  So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Finternet. [[06:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23639.34s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[06:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23644.34s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, [[06:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23652.34s)]
*  they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[06:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23659.34s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[06:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23663.34s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, [[06:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23669.34s)]
*  but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[06:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23673.34s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[06:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23678.34s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, [[06:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23681.34s)]
*  then at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[06:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23685.34s)]
*  Now, it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[06:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23693.34s)]
*  It was April of 24, and a lot has happened since then. [[06:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23697.34s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[06:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23701.34s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[06:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23705.34s)]
*  Then second is that all of the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[06:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23708.34s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[06:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23717.34s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[06:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23720.34s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[06:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23726.34s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, [[06:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23731.34s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[06:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23737.34s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[06:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23740.34s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. [[06:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23744.34s)]
*  But we're not wedded to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[06:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23754.34s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[06:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23759.34s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of by December of this year, [[06:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23765.34s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[06:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23770.34s)]
*  And these are in multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. [[06:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23775.34s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the internet approach. [[06:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23783.34s)]
*  And if we can work with making it user centric, universal and unified, [[06:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23790.34s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[06:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23796.34s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23801.34s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[06:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23804.34s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. [[06:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23810.34s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[06:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23814.34s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[06:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23817.34s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[06:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23822.34s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[06:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23824.34s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for that insight. [[06:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23833.34s)]
*  Let me turn back to Pierro and ask about the broader capital market implications. [[06:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23836.34s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that and Michelle as well. [[06:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23846.34s)]
*  So how do you see what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments [[06:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23856.34s)]
*  that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[06:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23869.34s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[06:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23878.34s)]
*  We came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[06:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23885.34s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[06:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23890.34s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[06:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23894.34s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[06:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23897.34s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[06:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23902.34s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[06:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23909.34s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[06:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23912.34s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[06:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23915.34s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization. [[06:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23919.34s)]
*  It's also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a unified financial capital market in Europe. [[06:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23930.34s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. [[06:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23941.34s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT I think can be clustered into two groups. [[06:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23947.34s)]
*  As Augustine was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. [[06:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23954.34s)]
*  And those are the low hanging fruit. [[06:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23962.34s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[06:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23965.34s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[06:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23967.34s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[06:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23977.34s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[06:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23980.34s)]
*  So basically we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[06:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23989.34s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody, [[06:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=23999.34s)]
*  I've done on the three different platforms. [[06:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24007.34s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[06:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24010.34s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and then data processing. [[06:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24015.34s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, right? [[06:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24021.34s)]
*  Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[06:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24027.34s)]
*  So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. [[06:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24033.34s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new services. [[06:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24040.34s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[06:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24052.34s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[06:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24056.34s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file, a very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[06:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24059.34s)]
*  So on a file you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, [[06:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24066.34s)]
*  how to pay, conditional on all possible states of the world. [[06:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24072.34s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial services more efficient. [[06:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24076.34s)]
*  And we need to bring the financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[06:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24088.34s)]
*  But let me conclude. [[06:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24093.34s)]
*  This is not an easy road. [[06:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24095.34s)]
*  It's a bumpy road, and many things can go wrong. [[06:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24097.34s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[06:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24100.34s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low, and we could end up in a situation [[06:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24108.34s)]
*  where we are stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[06:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24114.34s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, [[06:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24117.34s)]
*  and makes sure that innovation stays hard even at the infrastructure level. [[06:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24122.34s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[06:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24128.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[06:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24130.34s)]
*  And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[06:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24132.34s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[06:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24138.34s)]
*  From the nun we heard a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[06:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24148.34s)]
*  So, Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[06:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24158.34s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[06:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24166.34s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[06:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24171.34s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, [[06:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24175.34s)]
*  to innovation, and as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector? [[06:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24184.34s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. [[06:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24193.34s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[06:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24196.34s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[06:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24199.34s)]
*  I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[06:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24205.34s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money, but I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[06:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24207.34s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[06:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24213.34s)]
*  We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems. [[06:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24218.34s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, [[06:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24223.34s)]
*  which are a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[06:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24228.34s)]
*  So, against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. [[06:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24233.34s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[06:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24241.34s)]
*  So, it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[06:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24243.34s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[06:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24247.34s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[06:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24250.34s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public policy's interests as well. [[06:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24256.34s)]
*  Because these things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. [[06:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24264.34s)]
*  So, there is a very big public policy interest in this as well. [[06:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24272.34s)]
*  And I think that's what central banks can bring to this. [[06:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24275.34s)]
*  So, in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises are, [[06:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24278.34s)]
*  for example, how will this innovation promote or be consistent with monetary and financial stability? [[06:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24286.34s)]
*  Because that's obviously important to us. [[06:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24293.34s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes? [[06:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24296.34s)]
*  And how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[06:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24302.34s)]
*  So, I think these are really important questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[06:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24308.34s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I think we'll be completely behind the curve. [[06:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24314.34s)]
*  And we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[06:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24322.34s)]
*  So, for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[06:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24325.34s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is. [[06:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24334.34s)]
*  And a lot of our high value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. [[06:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24336.34s)]
*  So, if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you might pair with payments, [[06:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24342.34s)]
*  then we might get left out of it, and that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[06:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24355.34s)]
*  So, again, we think we're not going to drive this. [[06:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24363.34s)]
*  We're not going to tell people what to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in it. [[06:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24367.34s)]
*  How central bank money might be used in these circumstances, and what the policy implications might be of that. [[06:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24371.34s)]
*  And there's another point here I think it's worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, for example, [[06:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24382.34s)]
*  prudential regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also potentially interested in all these issues as well. [[06:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24388.34s)]
*  So, we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[06:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24396.34s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks, and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24401.34s)]
*  So, that's how I see our role. [[06:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24410.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24413.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[06:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24415.34s)]
*  And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. [[06:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24416.34s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance and legal certainty, [[06:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24430.34s)]
*  which are extremely important across countries. [[06:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24445.34s)]
*  So, how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[06:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24448.34s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, nationally. [[06:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24459.34s)]
*  Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[06:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24469.34s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role, but also how to engage with the private sector. [[06:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24473.34s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. [[06:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24480.34s)]
*  Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. [[06:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24487.34s)]
*  What we see in technology is that there are very big players. [[06:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24499.34s)]
*  They tend to dominate the game, and we can end up with walled gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. [[06:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24504.34s)]
*  So, we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, [[06:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24514.34s)]
*  but in a way that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. [[06:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24520.34s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[06:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24527.34s)]
*  Pierro called it old-fashioned. I don't think it's old-fashioned. [[06:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24540.34s)]
*  I think it's essential to have the trust that a central bank brings in itself, [[06:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24544.34s)]
*  which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. [[06:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24551.34s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[06:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24557.34s)]
*  So, given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust, [[06:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24564.34s)]
*  how should the central banks behave? [[06:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24574.34s)]
*  Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[06:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24577.34s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture together. [[06:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24594.34s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. [[06:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24601.34s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets, data privacy, [[06:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24609.34s)]
*  the legal enforceability of smart contracts and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[06:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24618.34s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, [[06:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24626.34s)]
*  but between traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[06:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24633.34s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[06:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24638.34s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. [[06:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24643.34s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we do today already. [[06:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24653.34s)]
*  Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[06:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24661.34s)]
*  So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized government bonds, [[06:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24668.34s)]
*  and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[06:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24677.34s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, [[06:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24683.34s)]
*  basically how to connect the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[06:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24691.34s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[06:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24701.34s)]
*  I think that is essential. I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[06:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24705.34s)]
*  Most of it, I would say, is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[06:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24711.34s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals, [[06:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24718.34s)]
*  and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[06:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24727.34s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. [[06:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24732.34s)]
*  I mean, we are the bank of the central banks. [[06:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24738.34s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[06:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24741.34s)]
*  I mean, we don't have a life on our own. We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. [[06:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24751.34s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[06:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24760.34s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[06:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24775.34s)]
*  And I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development and so on, [[06:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24781.34s)]
*  can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[06:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24793.34s)]
*  Thanks so much. And so, you know, one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so Nandan, [[06:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24801.34s)]
*  so how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? [[06:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24812.34s)]
*  And more specifically, so like on the one hand, you know, you want to have sort of like ease of payments and privacy, right, [[06:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24818.34s)]
*  which is foundational for money. But on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, I am all CFT compliance. [[06:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24830.34s)]
*  So, you know, how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[06:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24838.34s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules of the game, [[06:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24845.34s)]
*  in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, [[06:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24853.34s)]
*  then market players will innovate and create solutions. And the third leg of that is technology, [[06:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24862.34s)]
*  because tokenization technology needs to be demystified and made available in a much larger way, [[06:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24869.34s)]
*  which is what we are doing, which is creating Internet labs across the world, the US, Europe, India and Singapore, [[06:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24876.34s)]
*  and building the composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization in the real world. [[06:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24884.34s)]
*  And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, we can actually see significant progress. [[06:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24894.34s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, [[06:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24902.34s)]
*  such enormous value for inclusion, such enormous value for economic progress that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[06:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24909.34s)]
*  And we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the internet journey. [[06:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24918.34s)]
*  So please, you're welcome. [[06:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24923.34s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating panel. I think there are many topics to explore. [[06:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24927.34s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international community. [[06:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24933.34s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity, [[06:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24941.34s)]
*  but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[06:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24947.34s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[06:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24953.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24960.34s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing interest from market participants [[06:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24965.34s)]
*  to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in improving the current situation of financial market, [[06:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24973.34s)]
*  essentially because DLT and tokenization allow a different representation of assets in a digital form. [[06:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24983.34s)]
*  And these allow many new developments and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[06:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24992.34s)]
*  We also observed that the Europeans and the Europe banks are pretty active on this field, in this space. [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=24999.34s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT [[06:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25008.34s)]
*  and actually something like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. [[06:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25016.34s)]
*  Also on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[06:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25028.34s)]
*  We have also at the European level a specific legislation that allows that. [[06:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25035.34s)]
*  So this might improve the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[06:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25040.34s)]
*  So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space fairly early on for two fundamental reasons. [[06:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25049.34s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else will be there. [[06:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25061.34s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system [[06:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25067.34s)]
*  and credit risk, which is near and into commercial bank money. [[06:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25076.34s)]
*  So that we need to be there immediately as a central bank money. [[06:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25081.34s)]
*  And the second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[06:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25085.34s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[06:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25090.34s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, from November, we launched an experiment [[06:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25101.34s)]
*  of allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[06:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25113.34s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our market. [[06:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25128.34s)]
*  The concept of synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional system. [[06:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25140.34s)]
*  The three central banks of the euro system, they invented a very interesting solution so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT [[06:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25150.34s)]
*  and the settlement on central bank money in the RTGS basically. [[06:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25160.34s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing interest more than what we were expecting. [[06:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25165.34s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[06:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25177.34s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into production. [[06:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25180.34s)]
*  So we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability, allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central bank money. [[06:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25188.34s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets are. This is for the short term. [[07:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25202.34s)]
*  However, we are thinking about what to do in the long term. [[07:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25211.34s)]
*  And here we are open to a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you could have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. [[07:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25216.34s)]
*  You know, BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[07:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25231.34s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers which could take care of, you know, with the special life of different use case or adapt to specific condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. [[07:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25236.34s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. More to come. Great. Thanks so much, Piero. [[07:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25261.34s)]
*  And let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[07:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25267.34s)]
*  So when when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are fairly interchangeable to a first order approximation. [[07:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25273.34s)]
*  So, you know, it is there. [[07:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25285.34s)]
*  There are some minor differences, but, you know, DLT tokenization and blockchain are more or less the same thing. [[07:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25288.34s)]
*  So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through its innovation hub in particular, [[07:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25298.34s)]
*  but also its other activities at the at the BIS in terms of working with central banks to explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world. [[07:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25309.34s)]
*  And you have been particularly working on tokenization with central bank, but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. [[07:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25325.34s)]
*  So where are you, you know, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and so like the future of tokenization and finance? [[07:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25335.34s)]
*  Well, thank you. Thank you very much. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25350.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25353.34s)]
*  Tobias, it's great to be in this panel with two very distinguished central bankers, Michelle Piero and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[07:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25354.34s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[07:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25370.34s)]
*  And of course, I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[07:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25374.34s)]
*  Now, tokenization first is great that it has become a topic under which we can have a discussion like this. [[07:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25385.34s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[07:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25395.34s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions and the financial systems in general. [[07:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25401.34s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions they can make very important contribution. [[07:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25412.34s)]
*  First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[07:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25418.34s)]
*  The most where more of most developments have happened and more attention has been paid off is with payments and where obviously currencies. [[07:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25424.34s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[07:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25435.34s)]
*  Now, today, if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[07:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25438.34s)]
*  And it certainly would behoove us to make them far simpler. [[07:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25448.34s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[07:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25453.34s)]
*  Today, for example, when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation and settlement. [[07:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25456.34s)]
*  Given that separation, many mistakes can be made. [[07:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25465.34s)]
*  Controls can be lost, especially on KYC, AML CFD. [[07:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25468.34s)]
*  If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[07:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25474.34s)]
*  And this can be applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. [[07:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25481.34s)]
*  In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is to put everything, all the instructions, [[07:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25488.34s)]
*  all the procedures, regulation and so on, in a contained chip, I would say, [[07:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25500.34s)]
*  that would allow the execution of very complex transactions to the point that many of them, for example, we don't do today. [[07:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25510.34s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, the development of contingent assets or contingent transactions [[07:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25520.34s)]
*  are limited in its application because we don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[07:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25531.34s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this. [[07:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25539.34s)]
*  And therefore, tokenization can really be the future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[07:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25543.34s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[07:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25552.34s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. [[07:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25569.34s)]
*  And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. [[07:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25572.34s)]
*  Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated to something where you really can achieve the financial system, [[07:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25587.34s)]
*  contribute to the well-being of the different nations. [[07:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25598.34s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant. [[07:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25602.34s)]
*  And that's why we are supporting this fully at the PIS. [[07:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25610.34s)]
*  Now, one can ask, make the following question. [[07:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25616.34s)]
*  Why the take-off outside crypto has been slow in tokenization? [[07:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25619.34s)]
*  And I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts are isolated. [[07:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25625.34s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[07:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25635.34s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here in London. [[07:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25643.34s)]
*  We'll speak later. [[07:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25646.34s)]
*  I also will speak later about it. [[07:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25648.34s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCV, you're trying to integrate central bank money, [[07:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25650.34s)]
*  commercial bank money, different assets, and to have a joint vision to promote this. [[07:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25660.34s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices. [[07:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25667.34s)]
*  And we can go from individual innovations and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. [[07:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25674.34s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the VIS Innovation Hub. [[07:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25685.34s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[07:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25690.34s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together [[07:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25695.34s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation and make the system work as a whole. [[07:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25701.34s)]
*  In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[07:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25709.34s)]
*  For example, one is Agora, which is a first effort, major effort, where we're working with 40 commercial banks, [[07:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25716.34s)]
*  seven central banks, to really streamline dramatically cross-border payments. [[07:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25726.34s)]
*  And this works based on the organization. [[07:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25731.34s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great, and this could be a major platform to really make a cross-border payments extremely efficient. [[07:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25735.34s)]
*  And again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[07:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25745.34s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[07:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25752.34s)]
*  And Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important for a financial system of the future [[07:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25755.34s)]
*  to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way that Michelle expressed, [[07:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25765.34s)]
*  commercial bank digital money and government securities in tokenized fashion. [[07:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25773.34s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[07:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25781.34s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[07:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25790.34s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[07:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25795.34s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[07:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25807.34s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. [[07:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25812.34s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[07:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25823.34s)]
*  You would have to access Internet through a different device. [[07:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25828.34s)]
*  You would have a different phone. [[07:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25832.34s)]
*  You would have your camera. [[07:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25834.34s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[07:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25835.34s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[07:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25841.34s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[07:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25845.34s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[07:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25852.34s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[07:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25855.34s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[07:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25860.34s)]
*  I can comment more about that later. [[07:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25874.34s)]
*  But in any case, I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[07:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25877.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustín. [[07:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25883.34s)]
*  Yes, so it's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, [[07:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25885.34s)]
*  and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that that is the current juncture in many aspects. [[07:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25896.34s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustín on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[07:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25909.34s)]
*  So, you know, a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as the Internet. [[07:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25919.34s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet existing, and nowadays it is everywhere. [[07:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25929.34s)]
*  And I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services we could have such a seamless object. [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25938.34s)]
*  So, explain a little bit more your thinking around that, and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[07:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25950.34s)]
*  Thank you. I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades, [[07:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25960.34s)]
*  and we have seen that whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, payments are becoming instant. [[07:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25968.34s)]
*  You can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[07:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25977.34s)]
*  So, clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services. [[07:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25981.34s)]
*  But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose-specific infrastructure with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance. [[07:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25988.34s)]
*  And clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. [[07:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=25998.34s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing the old way of doing things. [[07:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26002.34s)]
*  It's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, portable, and interoperable from day one. [[07:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26011.34s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[07:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26020.34s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Finternet came in. [[07:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26024.34s)]
*  The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[07:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26029.34s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[07:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26034.34s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[07:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26038.34s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[07:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26043.34s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time to be in this new financial metaphor, [[07:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26046.34s)]
*  then we have to think differently. [[07:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26054.34s)]
*  And the idea of the Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. [[07:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26056.34s)]
*  And he had been writing about this new financial architecture. [[07:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26065.34s)]
*  And my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population scale systems [[07:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26072.34s)]
*  with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[07:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26079.34s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? [[07:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26084.34s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Finternet. [[07:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26092.34s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[07:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26096.34s)]
*  Now, what we're trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. [[07:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26106.34s)]
*  So basically, there are three important ways we look at it. [[07:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26115.34s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user centric. [[07:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26120.34s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[07:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26124.34s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[07:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26126.34s)]
*  So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Finternet. [[07:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26136.34s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[07:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26141.34s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, [[07:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26149.34s)]
*  they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[07:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26156.34s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[07:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26160.34s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, [[07:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26166.34s)]
*  but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[07:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26170.34s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[07:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26175.34s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, [[07:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26178.34s)]
*  then at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[07:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26182.34s)]
*  Now, it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[07:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26190.34s)]
*  It was April of 24, and a lot has happened since then. [[07:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26194.34s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[07:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26198.34s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26203.34s)]
*  Then second is that all of the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[07:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26206.34s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[07:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26215.34s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[07:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26218.34s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[07:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26224.34s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, [[07:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26228.34s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[07:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26234.34s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system, [[07:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26237.34s)]
*  and we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. [[07:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26241.34s)]
*  But we're not wedded to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[07:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26251.34s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[07:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26256.34s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of, by December of this year, [[07:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26262.34s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[07:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26267.34s)]
*  And these are multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers, and so on. [[07:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26272.34s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the fintanet approach. [[07:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26279.34s)]
*  And if we can work with making it user-centric, universal, and unified, [[07:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26286.34s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[07:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26292.34s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[07:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26298.34s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[07:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26301.34s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. [[07:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26307.34s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[07:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26311.34s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[07:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26313.34s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[07:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26318.34s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[07:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26320.34s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for that insight. [[07:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26329.34s)]
*  Let me turn back to Pierro and ask about the broader capital market implications. [[07:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26332.34s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that, and Michelle as well. [[07:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26342.34s)]
*  So how do you see what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments [[07:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26352.34s)]
*  that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[07:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26365.34s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[07:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26375.34s)]
*  We came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[07:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26382.34s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[07:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26387.34s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[07:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26391.34s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[07:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26394.34s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[07:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26398.34s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[07:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26404.34s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[07:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26407.34s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[07:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26410.34s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization. [[07:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26414.34s)]
*  It's also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a unified financial capital market in Europe. [[07:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26426.34s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. [[07:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26438.34s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT, I think can be clustered in two groups. [[07:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26444.34s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. [[07:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26451.34s)]
*  And those are the low-hanging fruit. [[07:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26459.34s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[07:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26461.34s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[07:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26464.34s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[07:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26474.34s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[07:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26477.34s)]
*  So basically, we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[07:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26486.34s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody are done on three different platforms. [[07:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26496.34s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[07:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26506.34s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[07:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26511.34s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, right? [[07:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26518.34s)]
*  Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[07:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26523.34s)]
*  So all this, at the end of the day, would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. [[07:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26529.34s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new services. [[07:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26536.34s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[07:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26548.34s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[07:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26552.34s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file, a very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[07:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26555.34s)]
*  So on a file, you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, how to pay, condition alone, all possible state of the world. [[07:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26561.34s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[07:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26572.34s)]
*  But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. It's a bumpy road. [[07:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26585.34s)]
*  And many things can go wrong. [[07:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26589.34s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation, [[07:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26591.34s)]
*  we could end up in a system where competition is low, and we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[07:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26599.34s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, and makes sure that innovation stays hard even at the infrastructure level. [[07:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26609.34s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[07:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26619.34s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[07:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26622.34s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[07:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26630.34s)]
*  From the nun we heard, a very foundational innovation around finance. [[07:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26640.34s)]
*  So, Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[07:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26647.34s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[07:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26656.34s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[07:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26662.34s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, to innovation, [[07:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26667.34s)]
*  and as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector? [[07:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26672.34s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. [[07:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26677.34s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[07:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26680.34s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[07:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26685.34s)]
*  Now, I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[07:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26690.34s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money, but I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[07:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26693.34s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[07:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26699.34s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[07:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26702.34s)]
*  We issue banknotes. [[07:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26707.34s)]
*  We're all operating RTGS systems. [[07:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26710.34s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, [[07:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26713.34s)]
*  which are a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[07:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26718.34s)]
*  So, against all that, I think it's incumbent upon us to do a lot of work. [[07:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26723.34s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[07:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26728.34s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[07:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26733.34s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public sector. [[07:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26738.34s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[07:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26743.34s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[07:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26746.34s)]
*  And I think that's a very important point. [[07:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26749.34s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26752.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26755.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26758.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26761.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26764.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26767.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26770.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26773.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26776.34s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26779.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26782.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26785.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26788.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26791.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26794.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26797.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26800.34s)]
*  and I think what central banks can bring to this, [[07:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26803.34s)]
*  strapped down under that guidelines and [[07:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26806.34s)]
*  For example, at the moment, [[07:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26830.34s)]
*  we've already talked about the fact that settlement [[07:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26831.34s)]
*  and central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[07:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26833.82s)]
*  systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. [[07:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26835.82s)]
*  So if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you [[07:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26840.82s)]
*  might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it and that might not have good [[07:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26849.54s)]
*  results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[07:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26854.86s)]
*  So again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what [[07:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26860.06s)]
*  to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money [[07:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26865.02s)]
*  might be used in these circumstances and what the policy implications might be of that. [[07:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26871.66s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, [[07:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26879.98s)]
*  for example, prudential regulators, consumer regulators and the government are also potentially [[07:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26885.06s)]
*  interested in all these issues as well. [[07:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26891.54s)]
*  So we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[07:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26893.42s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating [[07:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26898.98s)]
*  in order to make them work. [[07:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26906.42s)]
*  So that's how I see our role. [[07:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26908.019999999997s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[07:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26911.78s)]
*  And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, [[07:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26912.78s)]
*  cooperation across countries. [[07:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26922.66s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26926.62s)]
*  and legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. [[07:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26938.579999999998s)]
*  So how do you see that playing out across countries and not just advanced economies, [[07:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26945.26s)]
*  but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[07:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26952.34s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily [[07:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26955.46s)]
*  I would say at the beginning nationally. [[07:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26963.1s)]
*  Now the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[07:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26966.26s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role, but also how to engage with the private [[07:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26970.02s)]
*  sector. [[07:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26976.14s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be [[07:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26977.54s)]
*  the private sector. [[07:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26982.66s)]
*  Now I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private [[07:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26984.38s)]
*  sector in a more coherent fashion. [[07:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26993.100000000002s)]
*  What we see in technology is that there are very big players, they tend to dominate the [[07:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=26996.260000000002s)]
*  and we can end up with walled gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have [[07:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27004.62s)]
*  a lot of integration. [[07:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27009.82s)]
*  So we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in [[07:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27011.739999999998s)]
*  a way that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. [[07:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27017.82s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system [[07:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27024.86s)]
*  grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[07:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27031.3s)]
*  Pierro called it old fashioned, I don't think it's old fashioned, I think it's essential [[07:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27038.78s)]
*  is to have the trust that central bank brings in itself, which is to facilitate the singleness [[07:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27043.5s)]
*  of money and finality. [[07:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27051.219999999998s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve the element of trust is essential. [[07:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27054.3s)]
*  So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of [[07:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27061.82s)]
*  the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? [[07:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27067.38s)]
*  Again let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more [[07:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27074.38s)]
*  clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[07:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27083.18s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture [[07:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27091.42s)]
*  together. [[07:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27097.219999999998s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory [[07:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27098.66s)]
*  framework. [[07:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27104.899999999998s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized [[07:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27105.899999999998s)]
*  assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts and the relationship between [[07:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27113.140000000003s)]
*  tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[07:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27119.100000000002s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between, not only across jurisdictions, but between [[07:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27123.420000000002s)]
*  traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[07:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27131.140000000003s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[07:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27135.82s)]
*  Third, I think that again central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational [[07:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27141.02s)]
*  assets and platforms. [[07:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27149.06s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we [[07:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27151.14s)]
*  do today already. [[07:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27156.82s)]
*  Now we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[07:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27159.22s)]
*  So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized government [[07:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27165.54s)]
*  bonds, and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[07:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27173.54s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically [[07:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27180.7s)]
*  how to connect the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial [[07:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27188.7s)]
*  system. [[07:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27196.9s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[07:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27198.5s)]
*  I think that is essential. [[07:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27202.3s)]
*  I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[07:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27203.86s)]
*  Most of it I would say is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[07:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27208.9s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these [[07:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27215.06s)]
*  four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[07:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27222.38s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well that's what the BIS is there for. [[07:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27229.02s)]
*  We are the bank of the central banks. [[07:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27235.46s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the [[07:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27238.54s)]
*  interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[07:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27244.42s)]
*  We don't have a life on our own. [[07:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27249.019999999997s)]
*  We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. [[07:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27251.579999999998s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest [[07:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27256.699999999997s)]
*  and the relevance that central bank attributes to this subject. [[07:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27265.66s)]
*  In any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[07:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27272.14s)]
*  I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity [[07:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27277.579999999998s)]
*  development, and so on, can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[07:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27287.18s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[07:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27295.18s)]
*  One of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT. [[07:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27301.420000000002s)]
*  How do you think about the public and private sector interplay? [[07:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27309.74s)]
*  More specifically, on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments, of the amount of [[07:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27314.74s)]
*  money, and privacy, which is foundational for money. [[07:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27324.78s)]
*  But on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. [[07:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27329.260000000002s)]
*  How do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[07:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27336.52s)]
*  I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public [[07:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27341.78s)]
*  sector in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will govern the tokenized [[07:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27346.98s)]
*  organization. [[07:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27354.5s)]
*  Once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, then market players [[07:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27355.9s)]
*  will innovate and create solutions. [[07:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27360.14s)]
*  The third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[07:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27363.66s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating internet [[07:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27371.22s)]
*  labs across the world, the US, Europe, India, and Singapore, and building the composable [[07:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27376.5s)]
*  building blocks to make this happen, so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization [[07:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27384.58s)]
*  in the real world. [[07:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27390.34s)]
*  I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, we can actually [[07:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27392.06s)]
*  see significant progress. [[07:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27397.32s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this, because this has such enormous [[07:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27399.06s)]
*  value for society, such enormous value for inclusion, such enormous value for economic [[07:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27404.82s)]
*  progress, that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[07:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27410.780000000002s)]
*  And we are on this journey, and anybody can join us if they want on the Finternet journey. [[07:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27415.02s)]
*  Please, we are welcome. [[07:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27419.460000000003s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. [[07:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27422.02s)]
*  So this is the end of this fascinating panel. [[07:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27424.9s)]
*  I think there are many topics to explore. [[07:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27427.460000000003s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international [[07:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27430.58s)]
*  community. [[07:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27436.58s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity, [[07:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27438.78s)]
*  but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[07:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27443.98s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists, and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[07:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27448.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27457.399999999998s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing [[07:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27461.98s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in [[07:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27468.0s)]
*  improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[07:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27475.04s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new [[07:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27483.52s)]
*  developments, and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[07:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27490.600000000002s)]
*  We also observed that the European, in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, in [[07:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27497.32s)]
*  this space. [[07:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27504.4s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting [[07:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27506.079999999998s)]
*  with DLT, and actually something like 22% of them have already put in place some sort [[07:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27512.36s)]
*  of application implementing DLT. [[07:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27519.36s)]
*  Also, on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[07:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27526.36s)]
*  We have also, at the European level, a specific legislation that allows that, so this might [[07:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27533.56s)]
*  have improved the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[07:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27538.56s)]
*  So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space [[07:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27545.56s)]
*  fairly early on for two fundamental reasons. [[07:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27553.920000000002s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else [[07:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27557.16s)]
*  will be there. [[07:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27562.16s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize [[07:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27563.16s)]
*  that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system, and we have to be very careful [[07:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27569.16s)]
*  about fragmentation of the system and credit risk, which is inherent into commercial bank [[07:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27574.16s)]
*  money, so that we need to be there immediately as a central bank money. [[07:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27579.76s)]
*  The second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[07:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27585.0s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[07:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27589.16s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[07:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27594.96s)]
*  With this situation in mind, last year from May to September, well from November, we [[07:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27602.84s)]
*  launched an experiment, a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[07:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27609.84s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank [[07:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27618.96s)]
*  money. [[07:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27627.6s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the [[07:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27628.56s)]
*  asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional system. [[07:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27636.32s)]
*  The three central bank of the euro system, they invented a very interesting solution [[07:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27646.600000000002s)]
*  so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank [[07:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27652.120000000003s)]
*  money in the FTGS basically. [[07:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27658.28s)]
*  The experiment had been a big success. [[07:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27661.48s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing [[07:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27663.559999999998s)]
*  interest, more than what we were expecting. [[07:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27671.36s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[07:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27674.32s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into [[07:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27676.92s)]
*  production and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability [[07:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27683.92s)]
*  allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central [[07:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27690.32s)]
*  bank money. [[07:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27697.32s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT, on the same DLT where the assets [[07:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27698.239999999998s)]
*  are. [[07:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27705.519999999997s)]
*  This is for the short term. [[07:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27706.079999999998s)]
*  However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term. [[07:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27707.76s)]
*  And here we are open to a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified [[07:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27712.68s)]
*  ledger where you could have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money [[07:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27720.08s)]
*  assets. [[07:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27726.24s)]
*  BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[07:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27727.16s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers [[07:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27733.08s)]
*  which could take care of the special life of different use case or adapt to specific [[07:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27740.52s)]
*  condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. [[07:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27747.52s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. [[07:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27758.480000000003s)]
*  More to come. [[07:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27760.600000000002s)]
*  Great. [[07:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27761.800000000003s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[07:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27762.2s)]
*  Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[07:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27764.8s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are [[07:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27770.76s)]
*  fairly interchangeable to a first order approximation. [[07:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27778.12s)]
*  So there are some minor differences but DLT, tokenization and blockchain are more or less [[07:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27782.12s)]
*  the same thing. [[07:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27789.12s)]
*  So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[07:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27790.6s)]
*  its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of [[07:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27798.92s)]
*  working with central banks to explore innovation, to develop new technologies and to develop [[07:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27807.52s)]
*  to explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries around the world. [[07:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27815.2s)]
*  And you have been particularly working on tokenization with central banks but also with [[07:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27823.12s)]
*  commercial banks and with technology firms. [[07:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27828.2s)]
*  So where are you, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today [[07:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27831.88s)]
*  and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and the future of tokenization [[07:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27838.44s)]
*  and finance? [[07:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27845.92s)]
*  Well thank you very much, Tobias. [[07:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27848.6s)]
*  It's great to be in this panel with two very distinguished central bankers, Michel, Piero [[07:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27850.8s)]
*  and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur, thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make [[07:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27856.6s)]
*  things to become reality. [[07:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27864.399999999998s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[07:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27867.0s)]
*  And of course I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because [[07:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27870.88s)]
*  he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[07:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27876.36s)]
*  Now tokenization, first it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[07:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27882.0s)]
*  a discussion like this. [[07:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27889.76s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[07:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27892.48s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[07:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27898.0s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. [[07:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27906.64s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions they can make very important contributions. [[07:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27909.6s)]
*  First it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[07:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27915.920000000002s)]
*  And where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with [[07:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27921.52s)]
*  payments and well obviously currencies. [[07:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27928.52s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[07:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27931.68s)]
*  Now today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[07:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27935.399999999998s)]
*  complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[07:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27941.28s)]
*  And it certainly would behoove us to make them far simpler. [[07:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27946.239999999998s)]
*  That's something that tokenization can achieve. [[07:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27951.08s)]
*  Today for example when you do a payment usually there is a separation between messaging, reconciliation [[07:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27954.28s)]
*  and settlement. [[07:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27961.4s)]
*  Given that separation many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost especially on KYC, [[07:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27962.56s)]
*  AML, CFD. [[07:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27969.56s)]
*  If you integrate everything the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[07:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27971.72s)]
*  This can be applied not only for payments but for many other financial transactions. [[07:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27978.88s)]
*  In that sense tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability which is [[07:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27985.56s)]
*  to put everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation and so on in a [[07:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=27992.56s)]
*  contained chip I would say that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[07:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28002.56s)]
*  to the point that many of them for example we don't do today. [[07:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28011.48s)]
*  I mean traditionally if you have a discussion among economists many contingent, the development [[07:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28016.48s)]
*  of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we [[07:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28025.16s)]
*  don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[07:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28031.28s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this and therefore tokenization can really be the [[07:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28036.64s)]
*  future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[07:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28043.32s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact [[07:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28050.32s)]
*  that it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[07:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28058.239999999998s)]
*  India for example is a great example and through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen [[07:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28066.88s)]
*  which is the identity of people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an [[07:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28073.32s)]
*  unmistakable way. [[07:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28081.32s)]
*  Really what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated [[07:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28084.32s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being [[07:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28090.32s)]
*  of the different nations. [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28097.32s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant and that's why we are supporting [[07:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28100.32s)]
*  this fully at the PIS. [[07:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28108.32s)]
*  Now one can ask, make the following question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow [[07:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28113.32s)]
*  in tokenization and I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts but [[07:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28120.32s)]
*  those efforts are isolated. [[07:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28129.32s)]
*  We have not been fully able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[07:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28132.32s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here. [[07:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28140.32s)]
*  Nandan will speak later, I also will speak later about it. [[07:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28143.32s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of the ECB you [[07:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28146.32s)]
*  are trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets and [[07:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28153.32s)]
*  to have a joint vision to promote this. [[07:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28160.32s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices and we can go from individual innovations [[07:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28164.32s)]
*  and making the parts in a way work together in a virtuous way. [[07:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28173.32s)]
*  In a way that's what we are trying to do at the VIS Innovation Hub. [[07:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28181.32s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[07:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28186.32s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together but now we are paying attention on how they can fit together [[07:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28191.32s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation and make [[07:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28197.32s)]
*  the system work as a whole. [[07:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28203.32s)]
*  In terms of the, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[07:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28205.32s)]
*  For example, one is Agora, which is a first effort, major effort where we are working [[07:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28212.32s)]
*  with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks to really streamline dramatically cross border [[07:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28220.32s)]
*  payments. [[07:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28226.32s)]
*  This works based on the organization, the enthusiasm is great and this could be a major [[07:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28227.32s)]
*  platform to really make cross border payments extremely efficient. [[07:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28235.32s)]
*  Again, this could be the infrastructure we are creating can be part of broader developments. [[07:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28242.32s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[07:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28248.32s)]
*  Project Pine basically uses, I would say the trilogy that I find that is important for [[07:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28251.32s)]
*  a financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way that [[07:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28260.32s)]
*  Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money and government securities in tokenized [[07:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28267.32s)]
*  fashion. [[07:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28277.32s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way to [[07:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28278.32s)]
*  facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[07:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28283.32s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[07:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28287.32s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift [[07:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28292.32s)]
*  the boundaries of the financial system. [[07:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28300.32s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[07:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28304.32s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what [[07:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28309.32s)]
*  in telecommunications was achieved. [[07:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28317.32s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[07:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28320.32s)]
*  You would have to access Internet through a different device. [[07:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28325.32s)]
*  You would have a different phone. [[07:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28329.32s)]
*  You would have your camera. [[07:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28331.32s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[07:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28333.32s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[07:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28338.32s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[07:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28342.32s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[07:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28349.32s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[07:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28352.32s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, the provision [[07:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28356.32s)]
*  of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[07:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28366.32s)]
*  I can comment more about that later. [[07:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28370.32s)]
*  But in any case, I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[07:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28373.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustin. [[07:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28379.32s)]
*  And yes, so it's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, [[07:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28381.32s)]
*  and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that, [[07:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28393.32s)]
*  that is the current juncture in many aspects. [[07:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28399.32s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustin on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[07:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28405.32s)]
*  So, you know, kind of a global payment system that is just as seamless as the Internet. [[07:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28415.32s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet existing, [[07:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28426.32s)]
*  and nowadays it is everywhere. [[07:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28432.32s)]
*  And I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services [[07:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28434.32s)]
*  we could have such a seamless object. [[07:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28441.32s)]
*  So explain a little bit more your thinking around that, [[07:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28446.32s)]
*  and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[07:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28449.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28455.32s)]
*  I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades, [[07:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28457.32s)]
*  and we have seen that whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, [[07:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28464.32s)]
*  payments are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[07:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28471.32s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services. [[07:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28477.32s)]
*  But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose-specific infrastructure [[07:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28485.32s)]
*  with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance. [[07:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28491.32s)]
*  And clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. [[07:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28495.32s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing [[07:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28499.32s)]
*  the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, [[07:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28506.32s)]
*  portable, and interoperable from day one. [[07:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28514.32s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[07:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28517.32s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Finternet came in. [[07:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28521.32s)]
*  The thing is that they have been a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[07:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28524.32s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[07:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28531.32s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. [[07:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28534.32s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[07:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28537.32s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[07:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28540.32s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time [[07:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28542.32s)]
*  to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[07:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28547.32s)]
*  And the idea of the Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore [[07:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28552.32s)]
*  on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. [[07:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28558.32s)]
*  And he had been writing about this new financial architecture. [[07:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28561.32s)]
*  And my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population scale systems [[07:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28567.32s)]
*  with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[07:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28575.32s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? [[07:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28579.32s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Finternet. [[07:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28587.32s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 [[07:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28591.32s)]
*  and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[07:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28596.32s)]
*  Now, what we're trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. [[07:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28601.32s)]
*  So basically, there are three important ways we look at it. [[07:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28611.32s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user-centric. [[07:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28615.32s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[07:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28619.32s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user [[07:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28622.32s)]
*  where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[07:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28627.32s)]
*  So user-centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Finternet. [[07:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28633.32s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[07:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28638.32s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, [[07:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28645.32s)]
*  they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[07:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28653.32s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[07:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28656.32s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, [[07:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28663.32s)]
*  but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[07:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28667.32s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[07:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28672.32s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, [[07:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28675.32s)]
*  then we're at least creating a vision of what is possible [[07:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28679.32s)]
*  and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[07:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28683.32s)]
*  Now, it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[07:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28687.32s)]
*  It was April of 24, and a lot has happened since then. [[07:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28690.32s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[07:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28695.32s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[07:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28699.32s)]
*  Then second is that all over the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up [[07:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28702.32s)]
*  to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[07:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28707.32s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[07:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28711.32s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[07:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28715.32s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[07:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28720.32s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, [[07:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28724.32s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[07:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28730.32s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28733.32s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions [[07:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28737.32s)]
*  at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. [[07:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28742.32s)]
*  But we're not wedded to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[07:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28747.32s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[07:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28752.32s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months by the end of, by December of this year, [[07:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28758.32s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[07:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28763.32s)]
*  And these are multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. [[07:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28768.32s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the internet approach. [[07:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28774.32s)]
*  And if we can work with making it user-centric, universal and unified, [[07:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28781.32s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[07:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28787.32s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[07:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28793.32s)]
*  Moving it now, I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[07:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28796.32s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. [[08:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28803.32s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[08:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28807.32s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[08:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28810.32s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[08:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28815.32s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[08:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28817.32s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for that insight. [[08:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28825.32s)]
*  Let me turn back to Piero and ask about the broader capital market implications. [[08:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28830.32s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that and Michelle as well. [[08:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28839.32s)]
*  So how do you see what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital market developments [[08:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28849.32s)]
*  that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[08:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28862.32s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[08:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28872.32s)]
*  We came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[08:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28879.32s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[08:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28884.32s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[08:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28888.32s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[08:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28891.32s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[08:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28895.32s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[08:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28901.32s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[08:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28904.32s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[08:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28907.32s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based on tokenization [[08:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28911.32s)]
*  as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the backbone of a unified financial capital market in Europe. [[08:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28924.32s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. [[08:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28935.32s)]
*  The transformational potential of DLT I think can be clustered in two groups. [[08:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28941.32s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. [[08:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28947.32s)]
*  And those are the low-hanging fruit. [[08:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28955.32s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[08:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28958.32s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat money? [[08:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28960.32s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[08:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28970.32s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[08:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28973.32s)]
*  So basically we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[08:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28982.32s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of trading is the negotiation, the settlement, and the custody are done on the three different platforms. [[08:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=28992.32s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[08:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29002.32s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time, and data processing. [[08:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29007.32s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, right? [[08:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29014.32s)]
*  Through digitalization, through DLT, we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[08:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29019.32s)]
*  So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. [[08:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29026.32s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new services. [[08:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29033.32s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[08:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29045.32s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[08:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29049.32s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, it's a file. [[08:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29052.32s)]
*  A very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[08:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29056.32s)]
*  So on a file you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, how to pay, condition alone, all possible states of the world. [[08:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29060.32s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[08:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29070.32s)]
*  But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. [[08:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29080.32s)]
*  It's a bumpy road, and many things can go wrong. [[08:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29083.32s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[08:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29087.32s)]
*  We could end up in a system that is not very efficient. [[08:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29094.32s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low, and we could end up in a situation where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[08:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29098.32s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, and makes sure that innovation states are at the infrastructure level. [[08:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29109.32s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[08:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29120.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[08:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29123.32s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[08:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29130.32s)]
*  From the nun we heard a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[08:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29140.32s)]
*  So, Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[08:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29150.32s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[08:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29158.32s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[08:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29163.32s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning, to innovation? [[08:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29167.32s)]
*  And as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector. [[08:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29179.32s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. [[08:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29186.32s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[08:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29188.32s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[08:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29191.32s)]
*  I don't mean dictate the future of money. I don't mean mandate the future of money. [[08:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29197.32s)]
*  But I think helping to determine the future of money is really important. [[08:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29202.32s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[08:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29206.32s)]
*  We issue banknotes. We're all operating RTGS systems. [[08:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29211.32s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, [[08:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29216.32s)]
*  which are a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[08:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29221.32s)]
*  So, against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. [[08:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29226.32s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[08:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29234.32s)]
*  So, it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[08:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29236.32s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[08:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29240.32s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[08:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29243.32s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public, what's in public policy's interests as well. [[08:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29249.32s)]
*  Because these things are, yes, it's commercial, [[08:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29257.32s)]
*  but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. [[08:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29261.32s)]
*  So, there is a very big public policy interest in this as well, [[08:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29265.32s)]
*  and I think that's what central banks can bring to this. [[08:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29268.32s)]
*  So, in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises are, [[08:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29272.32s)]
*  for example, how will this innovation promote and be consistent with monetary and financial stability? [[08:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29279.32s)]
*  Because that's obviously important to us. [[08:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29286.32s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes, [[08:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29290.32s)]
*  and how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[08:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29295.32s)]
*  So, I think these are really important questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[08:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29301.32s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, [[08:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29307.32s)]
*  I think we'll be completely behind the curve, and we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[08:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29312.32s)]
*  So, for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[08:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29318.32s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is, and a lot of our high value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. [[08:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29327.32s)]
*  So, if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you might pair with payments, [[08:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29335.32s)]
*  then we might get left out of it, and that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[08:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29347.32s)]
*  So, again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what to do, [[08:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29355.32s)]
*  but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money might be used in these circumstances, [[08:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29361.32s)]
*  and what the policy implications might be of that. [[08:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29370.32s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, for example, [[08:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29375.32s)]
*  prudential regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also potentially interested in all these issues as well. [[08:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29381.32s)]
*  So, we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[08:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29389.32s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks, and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. [[08:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29394.32s)]
*  So, that's how I see our role. [[08:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29403.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[08:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29406.32s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle. [[08:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29408.32s)]
*  Leading onto that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. [[08:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29411.32s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance and legal certainty, [[08:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29422.32s)]
*  which are extremely important across countries. [[08:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29437.32s)]
*  So, how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[08:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29440.32s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, nationally. [[08:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29451.32s)]
*  Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[08:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29461.32s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role, but also how to engage with the private sector. [[08:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29465.32s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be the private sector. [[08:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29472.32s)]
*  Now, I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private sector in a more coherent fashion. [[08:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29479.32s)]
*  What we see in technology is that there are very big players, they tend to dominate the game, [[08:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29491.32s)]
*  and we can end up with walled gardens where you have fragmentation and you don't have a lot of integration. [[08:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29499.32s)]
*  So, we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, [[08:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29506.32s)]
*  but in a way that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. [[08:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29512.32s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[08:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29519.32s)]
*  Piero Colt is old-fashioned. I don't think it's old-fashioned. [[08:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29532.32s)]
*  I think it's essential to have the trust that a central bank brings in itself, [[08:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29536.32s)]
*  which is to facilitate the singleness of money and finality. [[08:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29544.32s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[08:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29549.32s)]
*  So, given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of the private sector and to preserve this trust, [[08:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29557.32s)]
*  how should the central banks behave? [[08:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29566.32s)]
*  Again, let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[08:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29569.32s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture together. [[08:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29586.32s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory framework. [[08:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29594.32s)]
*  This has to do with regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts, [[08:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29601.32s)]
*  and the relationship between tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29613.32s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, but between traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[08:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29618.32s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[08:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29630.32s)]
*  Third, I think that, again, central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational assets and platforms. [[08:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29636.32s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we do today already. [[08:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29646.32s)]
*  Now, we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[08:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29653.32s)]
*  So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits, and tokenized government bonds, [[08:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29660.32s)]
*  and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[08:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29669.32s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically how to connect the unified ledgers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial system. [[08:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29675.32s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[08:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29693.32s)]
*  I think that is essential. I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[08:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29697.32s)]
*  Most of it, I would say, is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[08:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29703.32s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[08:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29710.32s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. [[08:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29724.32s)]
*  I mean, we are the bank of the central banks. [[08:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29729.32s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[08:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29733.32s)]
*  I mean, we don't have a life on our own. [[08:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29743.32s)]
*  We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. [[08:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29747.32s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest and the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[08:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29752.32s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[08:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29766.32s)]
*  And I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity development and so on, can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[08:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29773.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. [[08:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29793.32s)]
*  So, you know, one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so, Nandan, so how do you think about the public and private sector interplay? [[08:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29796.32s)]
*  And more specifically, so like on the one hand, you know, you want to have sort of ease of payments and privacy, right, which is foundational for money. [[08:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29811.32s)]
*  But on the other hand, you need to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. [[08:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29825.32s)]
*  So, you know, how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[08:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29830.32s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the public sector in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will govern the tokenization. [[08:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29837.32s)]
*  And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, then market players will innovate and create solutions. [[08:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29850.32s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, [[08:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29858.32s)]
*  which is creating Internet labs across the world, the U.S., Europe, India and Singapore and building the composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment of tokenization in the real world. [[08:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29870.32s)]
*  And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, we can actually see significant progress. [[08:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29887.32s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this, because this has such enormous value for society, such an almost value for inclusion, such an almost value for economic progress that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[08:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29894.32s)]
*  And we are on this journey and anybody can join us if they want on the Internet journey. [[08:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29910.32s)]
*  So please, we are welcome. [[08:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29915.32s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. So this is the end of this fascinating panel. I think there are many topics to explore. [[08:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29919.32s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international community. [[08:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29926.32s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity, but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[08:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29934.32s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[08:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29946.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29953.32s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in improving the current situation of financial market. [[08:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29955.32s)]
*  Essentially because DLT and tokenization allow a different representation of assets in a digital form and this allows many new developments and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[08:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29975.32s)]
*  We also observed that the Europeans in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, in this space. [[08:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=29991.32s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we see that 60% of the banks are interested in experimenting with DLT and actually something like 22% of them have already put in place some sort of application implementing DLT. [[08:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30000.32s)]
*  Also on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[08:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30022.32s)]
*  We have also the European level of specific legislation that allows that. [[08:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30028.32s)]
*  So this might have improved the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[08:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30033.32s)]
*  So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space fairly early on for two fundamental reasons. [[08:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30043.32s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else will be there. [[08:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30052.32s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk, which is the risk of the future. [[08:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30058.32s)]
*  So we need to be there immediately as a central bank money. [[08:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30071.32s)]
*  The second reason is that the market is asking us to be there. [[08:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30076.32s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[08:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30080.32s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, from November, we launched an experiment, [[08:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30091.32s)]
*  a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank money. [[08:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30101.32s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or the idea of the central bank money. [[08:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30113.32s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional system. [[08:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30123.32s)]
*  The three central banks of the Euro system, they invented a very interesting solution so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on DLT. [[08:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30131.32s)]
*  The experiment has been a big success. [[08:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30143.32s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing interest, more than what we were expecting. [[08:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30148.32s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[08:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30155.32s)]
*  So we have a very interesting solution. [[08:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30158.32s)]
*  We have a very interesting solution. [[08:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30161.32s)]
*  So we have a very interesting solution. [[08:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30164.32s)]

*  you know, with the special eye for different use case or adapt to specific condition or [[08:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30238.32s)]
*  even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. [[08:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30244.92s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. [[08:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30254.72s)]
*  More to come. [[08:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30256.84s)]
*  Great. [[08:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30257.84s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[08:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30258.84s)]
*  And let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[08:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30260.88s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are [[08:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30267.0s)]
*  fairly interchangeable to a first order approximation. [[08:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30274.32s)]
*  So you know, it is, there are some minor differences, but you know, DLT, tokenization and blockchain [[08:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30278.36s)]
*  are more or less the same thing. [[08:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30288.8s)]
*  So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[08:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30291.3s)]
*  its Innovation Hub in particular, but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of [[08:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30299.84s)]
*  working with central banks to, you know, explore innovation that can be beneficial for many [[08:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30308.66s)]
*  countries around the world. [[08:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30317.3s)]
*  And you have been particularly working on tokenization, you know, with central banks, [[08:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30319.3s)]
*  but also with commercial banks and with technology firms. [[08:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30324.02s)]
*  So where are you, you know, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking [[08:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30328.1s)]
*  today and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and sort of the future [[08:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30333.54s)]
*  of tokenization and finance? [[08:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30340.16s)]
*  Well, thank you. [[08:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30343.5s)]
*  Thank you very much, Tobias. [[08:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30345.579999999998s)]
*  It's great to be in this panel. [[08:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30346.579999999998s)]
*  We two very distinguished central bankers, Michelle Piero and the tremendously dynamic [[08:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30348.9s)]
*  entrepreneur thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make things to become reality. [[08:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30355.260000000002s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[08:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30363.18s)]
*  And of course, I would say Tobias is an honorary member of the central banking community because [[08:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30367.06s)]
*  he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[08:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30372.420000000002s)]
*  Now tokenization, first, it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[08:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30378.22s)]
*  a discussion like this. [[08:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30385.98s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[08:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30388.7s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our financial transactions [[08:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30394.22s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. [[08:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30402.9s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions, they can make very important contribution. [[08:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30405.86s)]
*  First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[08:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30411.46s)]
*  Where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with payments [[08:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30418.98s)]
*  and well, obviously currencies. [[08:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30425.78s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[08:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30427.9s)]
*  Now today, if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[08:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30431.62s)]
*  complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[08:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30437.5s)]
*  And it certainly would be good to make them far simpler. [[08:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30442.46s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[08:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30447.219999999998s)]
*  Today, for example, when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging, [[08:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30449.94s)]
*  reconciliation and settlement. [[08:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30456.86s)]
*  And in that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially [[08:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30458.86s)]
*  on KYC, AML CFD. [[08:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30463.940000000002s)]
*  If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[08:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30467.98s)]
*  And this can be applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. [[08:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30474.940000000002s)]
*  In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is [[08:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30481.78s)]
*  to put everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation and so on, [[08:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30488.78s)]
*  in a contained chip, I would say, that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[08:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30497.62s)]
*  to the point that many of them, for example, we don't do today. [[08:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30507.739999999998s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, the development [[08:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30513.7s)]
*  of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we [[08:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30521.38s)]
*  don't have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[08:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30527.5s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this. [[08:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30532.86s)]
*  And therefore, tokenization can really be the future of a financial system with the [[08:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30536.54s)]
*  sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[08:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30542.940000000002s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact [[08:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30546.58s)]
*  that it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[08:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30554.46s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. [[08:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30562.06s)]
*  And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, which is the identity of [[08:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30566.260000000002s)]
*  people and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. [[08:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30572.780000000002s)]
*  Really what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated, [[08:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30580.7s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being [[08:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30587.02s)]
*  of the different nations. [[08:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30593.42s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant. [[08:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30596.739999999998s)]
*  And that's why we are supporting this fully at the PIS. [[08:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30604.019999999997s)]
*  Now one can ask, make the following question, why the take-off outside crypto has been slow [[08:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30609.66s)]
*  in tokenization? [[08:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30617.379999999997s)]
*  And I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, but those efforts [[08:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30619.02s)]
*  are isolated. [[08:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30626.98s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate [[08:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30628.82s)]
*  that. [[08:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30635.66s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here in Nanda, and we'll speak later. [[08:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30636.7s)]
*  I also will speak later about it. [[08:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30640.82s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of DCB, you're [[08:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30643.18s)]
*  trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, and to have [[08:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30650.14s)]
*  a joint vision to promote this. [[08:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30656.86s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices. [[08:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30660.420000000002s)]
*  And we can go from individual innovations and making the parts, in a way, work together [[08:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30667.98s)]
*  in a virtuous way. [[08:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30675.059999999998s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the VIES Innovation Hub. [[08:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30678.62s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[08:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30682.899999999998s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how they can fit [[08:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30688.46s)]
*  together and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation [[08:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30693.14s)]
*  and make the system work as a whole. [[08:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30699.82s)]
*  In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[08:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30702.5s)]
*  For example, one is AGORA, which is a first effort, major effort, where we're working [[08:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30709.3s)]
*  with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks, to really streamline dramatically cross-border [[08:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30717.22s)]
*  payments. [[08:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30723.620000000003s)]
*  And this works based on technization. [[08:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30724.86s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great, and this could be a major platform to really make cross-border [[08:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30728.780000000002s)]
*  payments extremely efficient. [[08:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30736.02s)]
*  And again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[08:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30738.06s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[08:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30745.34s)]
*  And Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important [[08:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30748.5s)]
*  for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC in the way [[08:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30756.34s)]
*  that Michelle expressed commercial bank digital money and government securities in tokenized [[08:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30764.18s)]
*  fashion. [[08:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30773.58s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way [[08:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30775.22s)]
*  to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[08:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30780.460000000003s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[08:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30784.18s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization to really shift [[08:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30788.940000000002s)]
*  the boundaries of the financial system. [[08:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30797.34s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[08:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30801.7s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, for example, what [[08:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30806.300000000003s)]
*  in telecommunications was achieved. [[08:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30814.460000000003s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[08:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30817.18s)]
*  You would have to access internet through a different device. [[08:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30821.780000000002s)]
*  You would have a different phone. [[08:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30826.280000000002s)]
*  You would have your camera. [[08:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30828.260000000002s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[08:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30830.1s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[08:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30835.3s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[08:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30839.82s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[08:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30846.34s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[08:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30849.42s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, coordination, the provision [[08:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30853.26s)]
*  of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[08:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30863.059999999998s)]
*  I can comment more about that later, but in any case, I think that the tokenization has [[08:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30867.179999999997s)]
*  a big promise into the future. [[08:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30873.579999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustín. [[08:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30876.98s)]
*  Yes, so it's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, [[08:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30879.219999999998s)]
*  and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that. [[08:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30889.899999999998s)]
*  That is the current juncture in many aspects. [[08:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30897.059999999998s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustín on this concept that you labeled the Finternet. [[08:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30903.5s)]
*  So a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as the internet. [[08:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30912.62s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the internet existing, and [[08:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30923.58s)]
*  nowadays it is everywhere. [[08:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30929.14s)]
*  And I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services [[08:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30932.02s)]
*  we could have such a seamless object. [[08:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30938.18s)]
*  So explain a little bit more your thinking around that, and particularly this intersection [[08:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30943.66s)]
*  between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[08:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30949.420000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30953.94s)]
*  I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades, and we have [[08:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30955.62s)]
*  seen that whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, payments [[08:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30962.46s)]
*  are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[08:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30969.18s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial [[08:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30974.46s)]
*  services. [[08:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30980.94s)]
*  All these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose specific infrastructure with their [[08:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30983.02s)]
*  own applications, their own data, their own maintenance, and clearly we have to think [[08:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30988.14s)]
*  about doing some things differently. [[08:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30993.42s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just [[08:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=30996.18s)]
*  digitizing the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation where money and [[08:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31002.18s)]
*  assets are programmable, portable, and interoperable from day one. [[08:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31009.3s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[08:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31014.1s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Fintanet came in. [[08:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31018.539999999997s)]
*  The thing is that they have a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[08:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31022.219999999998s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[08:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31028.019999999997s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. [[08:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31032.34s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[08:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31033.859999999997s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[08:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31037.04s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount [[08:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31039.32s)]
*  of time to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[08:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31043.48s)]
*  And the idea of the Fintanet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore on the G20 [[08:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31049.84s)]
*  meeting in February of 2023, and he had been writing about the Fintanet, writing about [[08:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31056.32s)]
*  this new financial architecture. [[08:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31063.18s)]
*  And my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population [[08:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31065.62s)]
*  scale systems with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[08:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31071.3s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to [[08:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31077.38s)]
*  tokenization? [[08:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31083.46s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Fintanet. [[08:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31085.420000000002s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 and actually published [[08:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31089.1s)]
*  the paper only in April of 24. [[08:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31094.859999999997s)]
*  Now what we are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across [[08:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31099.379999999997s)]
*  the world. [[08:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31107.46s)]
*  So basically there are three important ways we look at it. [[08:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31108.739999999998s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user centric. [[08:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31112.96s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[08:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31117.58s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user where the user can [[08:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31119.58s)]
*  buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[08:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31125.100000000002s)]
*  So user centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Fintanet. [[08:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31130.5s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[08:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31135.34s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever [[08:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31142.62s)]
*  it is, bonds, they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[08:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31148.1s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[08:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31153.66s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, but to create a universal [[08:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31159.26s)]
*  infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[08:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31165.14s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[08:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31169.12s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, then we're at least creating a vision [[08:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31171.82s)]
*  of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[08:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31177.54s)]
*  Now it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[08:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31183.739999999998s)]
*  It was April of 24. [[08:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31187.22s)]
*  And a lot has happened since then. [[08:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31189.3s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[08:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31192.38s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[08:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31196.18s)]
*  And second is that all over the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create [[08:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31199.84s)]
*  a framework for having tokenized assets. [[08:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31204.32s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[08:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31208.760000000002s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[08:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31212.0s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[08:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31217.82s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, how you [[08:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31221.78s)]
*  do credentialing, how you would create wallets. [[08:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31227.82s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[08:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31230.78s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction [[08:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31234.76s)]
*  level using public chain technology. [[08:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31241.12s)]
*  But we're not wedded to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[08:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31244.899999999998s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[08:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31249.6s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of December of this year, [[08:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31255.76s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[08:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31260.84s)]
*  And these are in multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers, and so on. [[08:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31265.92s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the internet approach. [[08:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31272.519999999997s)]
*  If we can work with making it user-centric, universal, and unified, we're really going [[08:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31280.239999999998s)]
*  to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[08:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31286.0s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[08:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31291.2s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be [[08:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31294.079999999998s)]
*  the challenge. [[08:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31298.8s)]
*  Technology will be available. [[08:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31300.719999999998s)]
*  It will be available as open source. [[08:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31301.719999999998s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[08:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31304.44s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[08:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31306.88s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[08:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31311.88s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much [[08:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31314.0s)]
*  faster. [[08:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31319.76s)]
*  Great. [[08:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31320.76s)]
*  Thanks so much for that insight. [[08:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31321.76s)]
*  Let me turn back to Piero and ask about the broader capital market implications. [[08:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31326.8s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to that, and Michelle as well. [[08:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31335.64s)]
*  So how do you see what central banks are doing on tokenization linked to the broader capital [[08:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31346.0s)]
*  market developments that are oftentimes beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[08:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31356.8s)]
*  So this question is particularly interesting for the European market. [[08:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31369.0s)]
*  We came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[08:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31376.559999999998s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[08:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31380.6s)]
*  I think we are in the order of 41. [[08:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31385.2s)]
*  We have something like 27 CSD in Europe. [[08:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31388.04s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market in this condition. [[08:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31392.76s)]
*  Fragmentation is a high cost. [[08:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31399.0s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[08:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31402.12s)]
*  Market-based finance for small and medium enterprises is a problem. [[08:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31404.44s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some new platform based [[08:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31409.0s)]
*  on tokenization as also an effort to improve the condition of the capital, at least the [[08:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31419.44s)]
*  backbone of a unified financial capital market in Europe. [[08:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31426.36s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to the dimension. [[08:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31432.04s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of DLT, I think can be clustered in two groups. [[08:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31437.8s)]
*  As Agustin was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more [[08:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31444.559999999998s)]
*  efficient way. [[08:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31450.64s)]
*  And those are the low-hanging fruit. [[08:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31452.2s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[08:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31454.8s)]
*  What can we do with DLT tokenization that we cannot do today because of the way we treat [[08:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31457.28s)]
*  money? [[08:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31465.719999999998s)]
*  Now, on the first front, it's pretty simple, right? [[08:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31467.08s)]
*  Just to give you some example, DLT would allow you to trade 24, 7, 360 days. [[08:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31471.0s)]
*  So basically, we could have a unified platform working around the clock all year long. [[08:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31479.48s)]
*  Second, if you think today the three key functions of the trading is the negotiation, the settlement [[08:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31489.48s)]
*  and the custody are done on three different platforms. [[08:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31496.04s)]
*  We could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three functions. [[08:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31500.760000000002s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time and data processing. [[08:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31505.08s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something, through DLT, [[08:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31511.16s)]
*  we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[08:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31519.84s)]
*  So all this, at the end of the day, would reduce costs and make it a more efficient [[08:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31523.24s)]
*  market. [[08:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31529.760000000002s)]
*  But the key difference will be thinking about DLT as a nibbler, as has been said, for new [[08:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31530.760000000002s)]
*  services. [[08:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31540.68s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[08:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31541.68s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[08:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31547.120000000003s)]
*  It's not any longer a scriptural, it's a file. [[08:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31550.36s)]
*  A very sophisticated file, but it's a file. [[08:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31554.0s)]
*  So on a file, you can put all the conditions you want, and so you can decide when to pay, [[08:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31557.399999999998s)]
*  how to pay, conditional on all possible states of the world. [[08:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31563.04s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial [[08:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31567.719999999998s)]
*  sector to a different stage. [[08:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31578.32s)]
*  But let me conclude. [[08:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31581.120000000003s)]
*  This is not an easy road. [[08:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31582.120000000003s)]
*  It's a bumpy road. [[08:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31583.84s)]
*  And many things can go wrong. [[08:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31585.32s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way, because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[08:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31587.600000000002s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low, and we could end up in a situation [[08:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31595.32s)]
*  where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[08:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31602.4s)]
*  So we need something that avoids fragmentation, increases competition, and makes sure that [[08:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31606.48s)]
*  innovation stays hard even at the infrastructure level. [[08:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31612.88s)]
*  Let me stop here. [[08:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31616.8s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[08:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31619.88s)]
*  And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[08:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31620.88s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[08:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31627.32s)]
*  From the nun we heard a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[08:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31637.52s)]
*  So Michel, turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[08:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31646.96s)]
*  Money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[08:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31656.120000000003s)]
*  Central banks have a clear mandate. [[08:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31661.120000000003s)]
*  How can central banks help in this broader transition to a new technological underpinning [[08:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31664.52s)]
*  to innovation and, as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the [[08:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31673.56s)]
*  private sector? [[08:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31681.36s)]
*  Thanks, Tobias. [[08:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31683.160000000003s)]
*  I think central banks do have a role. [[08:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31685.6s)]
*  One of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape [[08:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31688.879999999997s)]
*  the future of money. [[08:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31692.92s)]
*  Now, I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[08:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31693.92s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money, but I think helping to determine the future [[08:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31696.359999999997s)]
*  of money is really important. [[08:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31701.359999999997s)]
*  From our own perspective, and I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[08:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31703.12s)]
*  We issue bank notes. [[08:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31707.519999999997s)]
*  We're all operating RTGS systems. [[08:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31709.96s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are [[08:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31712.72s)]
*  a very important potential use case for tokenisation. [[08:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31717.920000000002s)]
*  So against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in [[08:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31723.0s)]
*  this and work with the commercial sector. [[08:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31726.56s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[08:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31730.32s)]
*  So it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[08:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31732.600000000002s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[08:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31736.280000000002s)]
*  I think what central banks can bring, and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing, [[08:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31740.24s)]
*  is the role of leadership in terms of what's in public policy's interests as well. [[08:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31745.600000000002s)]
*  These things are, yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all [[08:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31755.2s)]
*  the reasons we've spoken about. [[08:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31760.320000000003s)]
*  So there is a very big public policy interest in this as well, and I think that's what central [[08:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31761.800000000003s)]
*  banks can bring to this. [[08:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31766.440000000002s)]
*  So in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as [[08:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31768.98s)]
*  we go through these exercises are, for example, how will this innovation promote or be consistent [[08:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31773.98s)]
*  with monetary and financial stability, because that's obviously important to us. [[08:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31781.14s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes, and how will they [[08:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31787.22s)]
*  promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[08:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31792.739999999998s)]
*  I think these are really important questions, and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[08:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31797.820000000003s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I think [[08:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31803.980000000003s)]
*  we'll be completely behind the curve, and we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[08:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31809.02s)]
*  So for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central [[08:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31814.86s)]
*  bank money is the safest way to do it. [[08:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31820.4s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is, and all our high value systems at the moment, they [[08:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31823.74s)]
*  settle in central bank money. [[08:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31829.460000000003s)]
*  So if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you [[08:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31833.34s)]
*  might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it, and that mightn't have good [[08:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31842.06s)]
*  results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[08:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31847.38s)]
*  So again, we think we're not going to drive this, we're not going to tell people what [[08:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31852.54s)]
*  to do, but I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central bank money might [[08:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31857.5s)]
*  be used in these circumstances, and what the policy implications might be of that. [[08:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31864.5s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making, is that other regulatory authorities, [[08:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31872.46s)]
*  for example, prudential regulators, consumer regulators, and the government are also potentially [[08:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31877.579999999998s)]
*  interested in all these issues as well. [[08:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31884.02s)]
*  So we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[08:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31885.92s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks, and they need lots of stakeholders cooperating [[08:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31891.5s)]
*  in order to make them work. [[08:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31898.92s)]
*  So that's how I see our role. [[08:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31900.5s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michel. [[08:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31903.98s)]
*  And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, [[08:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31905.22s)]
*  cooperation across countries. [[08:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31915.22s)]
*  Of course, Michel mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance [[08:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31919.1s)]
*  and legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. [[08:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31931.140000000003s)]
*  So how do you see that playing out across countries, and not just advanced economies, [[08:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31937.74s)]
*  but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[08:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31944.74s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination and cooperation internationally, but primarily, [[08:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31947.82s)]
*  I would say at the beginning, nationally. [[08:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31954.82s)]
*  The main coordination has to be between authorities. [[08:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31959.420000000002s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role. [[08:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31962.56s)]
*  But also how to engage with the private sector. [[08:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31966.620000000003s)]
*  Most of the development, most of the operation, whoever will be tokenizing assets will be [[08:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31970.06s)]
*  the private sector. [[08:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31975.100000000002s)]
*  I think what is key is to steer the cooperation and to steer the participation of the private [[08:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31977.980000000003s)]
*  sector in a more coherent fashion. [[08:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31985.62s)]
*  What we see in technology is that there are very big players, they tend to dominate the [[08:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31988.78s)]
*  game, and we can end up with walled gardens, where you have fragmentation and you don't [[08:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=31996.14s)]
*  have a lot of integration. [[08:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32002.02s)]
*  So we need to exploit the energy, the knowledge, the resources of the private sector, but in [[08:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32004.22s)]
*  a way that brings together an efficient competitive financial system open to everybody. [[08:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32010.38s)]
*  The other important part, the other important pillar is to preserve and to make this system [[08:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32017.38s)]
*  grow out of the features that we have in today's traditional banking system. [[08:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32023.82s)]
*  Piero Colt is old fashioned, I don't think it's old fashioned, I think it's essential [[08:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32030.82s)]
*  to have the trust that central bank brings in itself, which is to facilitate the singleness [[08:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32036.18s)]
*  of money and finality. [[08:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32043.739999999998s)]
*  I think precisely to preserve that element of trust is essential. [[08:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32046.82s)]
*  So given these two conditions, one that we need to sort of steer the participation of [[08:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32054.34s)]
*  the private sector and to preserve this trust, how should the central banks behave? [[08:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32059.9s)]
*  Again let me emphasize, number one, we need to express much clearly and articulate more [[08:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32066.9s)]
*  clearly what is the vision in a way that this can facilitate joint experimentation. [[08:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32075.7s)]
*  We need to get people working towards a common goal, but we need to try to bring that picture [[08:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32083.9s)]
*  together. [[08:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32089.82s)]
*  Number two, we need, as Michelle mentioned, we need to develop an appropriate regulatory [[08:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32091.14s)]
*  framework. [[08:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32097.38s)]
*  This has to do, we need regulatory clarity around issues like the status of tokenized [[08:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32098.78s)]
*  assets, data privacy, the legal enforceability of smart contracts and the relationship between [[08:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32104.98s)]
*  tokenized assets and their non-tokenized counterparts. [[08:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32111.579999999998s)]
*  We need to assure interoperability between not only across jurisdictions, but between [[08:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32115.9s)]
*  traditional and new expressions of the financial system. [[08:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32123.74s)]
*  We need to be able to fully comply with the MLCFT and KYC. [[08:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32128.300000000003s)]
*  Third, I think that again central banks and authorities should provide the basic foundational [[08:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32133.460000000003s)]
*  assets and platforms. [[08:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32141.54s)]
*  And this is something that happens today, so it's not an additional ask of what we [[08:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32143.58s)]
*  do today already. [[08:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32149.260000000002s)]
*  Now we have to do this in a way that it has the adequate technological representation. [[08:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32151.7s)]
*  So here I'm talking about wholesale CBDC, tokenized deposits and tokenized government [[08:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32158.02s)]
*  bonds and to facilitate the tokenization of different assets. [[08:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32166.06s)]
*  And also we might support the provision of basic financial infrastructure, basically [[08:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32173.18s)]
*  how to connect the unified layers to support interoperability between the tokenized financial [[08:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32181.620000000003s)]
*  system. [[08:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32189.38s)]
*  And fourth, I think we need to work for private-public partnerships. [[08:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32190.98s)]
*  I think that is essential. [[08:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32194.780000000002s)]
*  I think there's a lot that the private sector can bring to the table. [[08:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32196.36s)]
*  Most of it I would say is there, but we need to find ways to coordinate this. [[08:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32201.440000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of the work that Nandan is doing will be tremendously powerful towards these [[08:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32207.56s)]
*  four goals, and it would facilitate to get where we want. [[08:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32214.88s)]
*  In terms of coordination among central banks, well, that's what the BIS is there for. [[08:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32220.88s)]
*  We are the bank of the central banks. [[08:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32227.920000000002s)]
*  The fact that the BIS has been doing a lot of work on this is just an expression of the [[08:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32231.04s)]
*  interest on the central banks in this subject matter. [[08:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32236.960000000003s)]
*  I mean, we don't have a life on our own. [[08:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32240.440000000002s)]
*  We respond to the needs of the central banks, to the expression of interest. [[08:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32244.08s)]
*  So what we have done through the hope is more than anything of an expression of the interest. [[08:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32249.2s)]
*  And the relevance of central bank attributes to this subject. [[08:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32258.32s)]
*  So in any way, I think the BIS will continue supporting this effort. [[08:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32264.32s)]
*  And I think the IMF, through the reach you have to your universal membership, your capacity, [[08:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32270.08s)]
*  development, and so on, can also facilitate more synergies among international institutions. [[08:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32279.960000000003s)]
*  Yeah, thanks so much. [[08:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32288.08s)]
*  So one of the things you pointed to is EMLCFT and so, Nandan, so how do you think about [[08:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32293.0s)]
*  the public and private sector interplay? [[08:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32304.120000000003s)]
*  And more specifically, on the one hand, you want to have ease of payments and the other [[08:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32308.16s)]
*  hand, privacy, right, which is foundational for money, but on the other hand, you need [[08:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32318.2s)]
*  to ensure integrity, EMLCFT compliance. [[08:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32322.68s)]
*  So how do you think about that in the vision for the tokenized financial system? [[08:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32327.440000000002s)]
*  Well, I think like everything else, we have to find the balance between the role of the [[08:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32333.88s)]
*  public sector in framing the rules of the game in the regulations that will govern the [[08:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32339.120000000003s)]
*  tokenization. [[08:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32346.239999999998s)]
*  And once those rules are well defined and the playing field is defined, then market [[08:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32348.16s)]
*  players will innovate and create solutions. [[08:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32352.32s)]
*  And the third leg of that is technology, because tokenization technology needs to be demystified [[08:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32356.16s)]
*  and made available in a much larger way, which is what we are doing, which is creating internet [[08:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32363.76s)]
*  labs across the world, the U.S., Europe, India, and Singapore, and building the conversations [[08:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32369.039999999997s)]
*  and composable building blocks to make this happen so that we can accelerate the deployment [[08:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32376.16s)]
*  of tokenization in the real world. [[08:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32381.76s)]
*  And I think over the next few years, if we really put our hearts and minds on it, we [[08:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32384.039999999997s)]
*  can actually see significant progress. [[08:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32388.8s)]
*  And it's really up to the people in this room to drive this, because this has such enormous [[08:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32391.52s)]
*  value for society, such enormous value for inclusion, such enormous value for economic [[08:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32397.28s)]
*  progress, that we have to make every effort to expedite that. [[09:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32403.440000000002s)]
*  And we are on this journey, and anybody can join us if they want on the internet journey. [[09:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32407.56s)]
*  So please, we are welcome. [[09:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32412.04s)]
*  Okay, thank you so much. [[09:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32415.04s)]
*  So this is the end of this fascinating panel. [[09:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32417.4s)]
*  I think there are many topics to explore. [[09:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32419.960000000003s)]
*  Let me again thank Augustine particularly for his long service in the international [[09:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32423.08s)]
*  community. [[09:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32429.08s)]
*  This is the last time you are at one of these IMF World Bank meetings in official capacity, [[09:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32431.26s)]
*  but we are all looking forward to working with you in your next chapter. [[09:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32436.46s)]
*  Thank you so much for all panelists, and thanks for your interest in this very important topic. [[09:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32441.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32449.899999999998s)]
*  And to stay on the specific of the wholesale, we have been observing that there is a growing [[09:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32454.42s)]
*  interest from market participants to explore how tokenization and DLT can play a role in [[09:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32460.5s)]
*  improving the current situation of financial market, essentially because DLT and tokenization [[09:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32467.5s)]
*  allow a different representation of assets in a digital form, and this allows many new [[09:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32475.98s)]
*  developments, and we can dig on that later on in the discussion. [[09:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32483.059999999998s)]
*  And we also observed that the European, in Europe, banks are pretty active on this field, [[09:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32488.58s)]
*  in this space. [[09:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32496.82s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we see that 60 percent of the banks are interested in [[09:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32498.54s)]
*  experimenting with DLT, and actually something like 22 percent of them have already put in [[09:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32504.06s)]
*  place some sort of application implementing DLT. [[09:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32511.420000000002s)]
*  Also, on the security side, we have seen a growing interest in issuing that. [[09:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32519.460000000003s)]
*  We have also, at the European level, a specific legislation that allows that, so this might [[09:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32526.02s)]
*  have improved the conditions so that banks venture more easily into this. [[09:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32531.02s)]
*  So, confronted with this scenario, the ECB, we think that we need to be in this space [[09:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32538.260000000002s)]
*  fairly early on for two fundamental reasons. [[09:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32549.3s)]
*  One reason is the fact that if we are not there with central bank money, somebody else [[09:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32553.22s)]
*  will be there. [[09:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32557.46s)]
*  We don't have anything against commercial bank money, but certainly we have to recognize [[09:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32558.74s)]
*  that we run the risk of new fragmentation of the system and credit risk, which is near [[09:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32564.7s)]
*  and into commercial bank money, so that we need to be there immediately as a central [[09:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32569.9s)]
*  bank money. [[09:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32576.34s)]
*  And the second reason is that market is asking us to be there. [[09:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32577.420000000002s)]
*  From our contact with the market, we are encouraged to offer central bank money because market [[09:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32581.62s)]
*  participants say that this is essential for the market to develop. [[09:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32587.420000000002s)]
*  So with this situation in mind, last year from May to September, well from November, [[09:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32593.1s)]
*  we launched an experiment, a work on allowing experiment and trial so that people that want [[09:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32601.18s)]
*  to experiment and have transaction on DLT could settle this transaction in central bank [[09:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32611.46s)]
*  money. [[09:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32620.059999999998s)]
*  The concept that we explore was this concept of synchronization or coordination of the [[09:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32621.02s)]
*  asset transaction on DLT with our target services, which is our traditional system. [[09:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32628.78s)]
*  The three central bank of the Euro system, they invented a very interesting solution [[09:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32639.06s)]
*  so that you could coordinate the transaction on DLT and the settlement on central bank [[09:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32644.58s)]
*  money in the FTGS basically. [[09:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32650.42s)]
*  The experiment had been a big success. [[09:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32653.94s)]
*  We had more than 60 participants exploring many use cases, big issuance, so a growing [[09:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32656.46s)]
*  interest more than what we were expecting. [[09:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32663.82s)]
*  So the question is what do we do from there? [[09:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32666.78s)]
*  So we want to continue and get into production, move from the experiment mindset and go into [[09:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32669.379999999997s)]
*  production and we will devise soon a solution in which through this concept of interoperability [[09:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32676.38s)]
*  allowing the market to grow in expanding their business on DLT while providing for us central [[09:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32682.780000000002s)]
*  bank money. [[09:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32689.54s)]
*  Again, we are not at this stage putting money on the DLT on the same DLT where the assets [[09:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32690.7s)]
*  are. [[09:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32697.940000000002s)]
*  This is for the short term. [[09:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32698.54s)]
*  However, we are also thinking about what to do in the long term and here we are hoping [[09:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32700.22s)]
*  to a much more possible integrated solution where we can have a unified ledger where you [[09:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32706.06s)]
*  could have on the same platform central bank money, commercial bank money assets. [[09:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32713.86s)]
*  BIS has been very vocal about the benefits of all this and this is a possibility. [[09:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32719.54s)]
*  An alternative possibility would be to have an ecosystem of fully interoperable ledgers [[09:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32725.54s)]
*  which could take care of the special life of different use case or adapt to specific [[09:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32732.98s)]
*  condition or even allow for a better transition from the traditional RTGS to this new solution. [[09:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32739.98s)]
*  So the news is stay tuned. [[09:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32750.940000000002s)]
*  More to come. [[09:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32753.06s)]
*  Great. [[09:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32754.260000000002s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. [[09:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32754.780000000002s)]
*  Let me just interject a little bit of a side note on vocabulary. [[09:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32757.9s)]
*  So when our panelists talk about tokenization, distributed ledger or blockchain, these are [[09:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32763.260000000002s)]
*  fairly interchangeable to first order approximation. [[09:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32770.78s)]
*  So there are some minor differences but DLT, tokenization and blockchain are more or less [[09:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32774.62s)]
*  the same thing. [[09:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32786.14s)]
*  So Augustine, the BIS, the Bank for International Settlement in Basel has been very active through [[09:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32787.58s)]
*  its innovation hub in particular but also its other activities at the BIS in terms of [[09:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32796.14s)]
*  working with central banks to explore innovation that can be beneficial for many countries [[09:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32804.94s)]
*  around the world. [[09:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32812.94s)]
*  And you've been particularly working on tokenization with central banks but also with commercial [[09:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32813.94s)]
*  banks and with technology firms. [[09:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32818.94s)]
*  So where are you, having done this for a number of years now, where is your thinking today [[09:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32822.94s)]
*  and how do you see the contribution to the financial system and the future of tokenization [[09:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32828.94s)]
*  and finance? [[09:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32836.94s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Tobias. [[09:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32839.94s)]
*  It's great to be in this panel with two very distinguished central bankers, Michelle Piero [[09:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32841.94s)]
*  and the tremendously dynamic entrepreneur, thought leader, Nandan, who knows how to make [[09:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32846.94s)]
*  things to become reality. [[09:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32855.94s)]
*  And I think that's why it's great to have somebody like Nandan here with us. [[09:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32857.94s)]
*  And of course I would say Tobias, he's an honorary member of the central banking community [[09:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32861.94s)]
*  because he makes always very strong contributions in that respect. [[09:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32867.94s)]
*  Now, tokenization, first it's great that it has become a topic under which we can have [[09:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32872.94s)]
*  a discussion like this. [[09:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32881.94s)]
*  And tokenization in terms of its applicability to financial transactions. [[09:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32883.94s)]
*  I think tokenization has a huge potential to contribute to our future. [[09:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32888.94s)]
*  And I think that's why it's important to think about the future of our financial transactions [[09:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32896.94s)]
*  and the financial systems in general. [[09:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32901.94s)]
*  I would say at least in two directions they can make very important contributions. [[09:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32904.94s)]
*  First, it certainly can improve the way the financial system works today. [[09:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32909.94s)]
*  The most, where most developments have happened and most attention has been paid off is with [[09:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32914.94s)]
*  currency. [[09:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32922.94s)]
*  But those are the most elementary type of transactions. [[09:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32923.94s)]
*  Now, today if you see how a payment is done, what goes behind the scenes is tremendously [[09:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32926.94s)]
*  complex, tremendously cumbersome. [[09:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32932.94s)]
*  And it certainly would be good to make them far simpler. [[09:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32936.94s)]
*  And that's something that tokenization can achieve. [[09:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32942.94s)]
*  Today, for example, when you do a payment, usually there is a separation between messaging [[09:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32945.94s)]
*  reconciliation and settlement. [[09:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32951.94s)]
*  Given that separation, many mistakes can be made, controls can be lost, especially on KYC, [[09:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32953.94s)]
*  AML CFD. [[09:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32960.94s)]
*  If you integrate everything, the efficiency of the system is quite assured. [[09:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32962.94s)]
*  And this can be applied not only for payments, but for many other financial transactions. [[09:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32969.94s)]
*  In that sense, tokenization also allows something that we can call programmability, which is [[09:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32976.94s)]
*  to put everything, all the instructions, all the procedures, regulation, and so on, in [[09:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32983.94s)]
*  a contained chip, I would say, that would allow the execution of very complex transactions [[09:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=32993.94s)]
*  to the point that many of them, for example, we don't do today. [[09:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33002.94s)]
*  I mean, traditionally, if you have a discussion among economists, many contingent, the development [[09:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33008.94s)]
*  of contingent assets or contingent transactions are limited in its application because we don't [[09:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33016.94s)]
*  have a way to put them together and put them into play. [[09:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33022.94s)]
*  Tokenization definitely could facilitate this, and therefore, tokenization can really be the [[09:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33027.94s)]
*  future of a financial system with the sophistication that today we cannot imagine. [[09:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33034.94s)]
*  Another very attractive aspect of tokenization and of technological development is the fact that [[09:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33041.94s)]
*  it would allow many countries to leapfrog from where they are today. [[09:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33050.94s)]
*  India, for example, is a great example. [[09:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33057.94s)]
*  And through one of the contributions that Nanda made happen, which is the identity of people, [[09:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33060.94s)]
*  and to be able to map accounts with individuals in an unmistakable way. [[09:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33068.94s)]
*  Really, what you can do is to leapfrog from being very backward, very unsophisticated, [[09:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33075.94s)]
*  to something where you really can achieve the financial system contribute to the well-being [[09:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33082.94s)]
*  of the different nations. [[09:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33088.94s)]
*  The contribution of this for inclusion is very, very significant, and that's why we are supporting [[09:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33091.94s)]
*  this fully at the PIS. [[09:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33101.94s)]
*  Now, one can ask, make the following question, why the take-up outside crypto has been slow [[09:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33104.94s)]
*  in tokenization, and I think part of it is because we have unleashed many efforts, [[09:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33112.94s)]
*  but those efforts are isolated. [[09:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33120.94s)]
*  We have not been fully been able to fully come with a vision of how can we integrate that. [[09:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33123.94s)]
*  We have tried it through the internet here in London. [[09:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33131.94s)]
*  We'll speak later. [[09:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33135.94s)]
*  I also will speak later about it. [[09:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33136.94s)]
*  I really welcome what Piero just said about the fact that in the sphere of the ECB, [[09:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33138.94s)]
*  you're trying to integrate central bank money, commercial bank money, different assets, [[09:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33145.94s)]
*  and to have a joint vision to promote this. [[09:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33151.94s)]
*  If we have this vision, that could allow coordination devices, and we can go from individual [[09:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33155.94s)]
*  innovations and making the parts, in a way, work together in a virtuous way. [[09:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33163.94s)]
*  In a way, that's what we're trying to do at the VIES Innovation Hub. [[09:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33173.94s)]
*  We also have started with very specific projects. [[09:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33177.94s)]
*  Many of them do not fit together, but now we're paying attention on how they can fit together [[09:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33182.94s)]
*  and how can we use a platform that can invite more private sector participation [[09:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33188.94s)]
*  and make the system work as a whole. [[09:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33194.94s)]
*  In terms of, for example, the projects that we have been doing, let me mention two. [[09:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33197.94s)]
*  For example, one is Agora, which is a first effort, major effort, [[09:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33204.94s)]
*  where we're working with 40 commercial banks, seven central banks, [[09:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33211.94s)]
*  to really streamline dramatically cross-border payments. [[09:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33215.94s)]
*  This works based on the conversation. [[09:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33219.94s)]
*  The enthusiasm is great, and this could be a major platform [[09:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33223.94s)]
*  to really make cross-border payments extremely efficient. [[09:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33228.94s)]
*  Again, this could be the infrastructure we're creating can be part of broader developments. [[09:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33233.94s)]
*  The other is Project Pine. [[09:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33240.94s)]
*  Project Pine basically uses, I would say, the trilogy that I find that is important [[09:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33243.94s)]
*  for a financial system of the future to have in tokenized way wholesale CBDC [[09:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33251.94s)]
*  in the way that Michelle expressed, commercial bank digital money, [[09:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33259.94s)]
*  and government securities in tokenized fashion. [[09:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33264.94s)]
*  And here the idea on the Project Pine is how can this be used in an integrated way [[09:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33269.94s)]
*  to facilitate implementation of monetary policy. [[09:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33275.94s)]
*  So even for those purposes, the tokenization effort could be great. [[09:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33279.94s)]
*  I would say that our imagination is the limit in terms of using tokenization [[09:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33283.94s)]
*  to really shift the boundaries of the financial system. [[09:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33290.94s)]
*  Today, again, it's difficult, very difficult to make transactions. [[09:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33295.94s)]
*  A lot of progress has been made, but at some point we need to achieve, [[09:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33301.94s)]
*  for example, what in telecommunications was achieved. [[09:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33308.94s)]
*  Many years ago, like 10 years ago, you would have a messaging machine. [[09:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33311.94s)]
*  You would have to access Internet through a different device. [[09:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33316.94s)]
*  You would have a different phone. You would have your camera. [[09:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33321.94s)]
*  It would be tremendously difficult even to take a photograph and send it. [[09:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33325.94s)]
*  Today you can do it immediately because everything is integrated. [[09:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33330.94s)]
*  If we can do that in the financial system, we really would be making a huge breakthrough. [[09:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33334.94s)]
*  And the important thing is that technology is there. [[09:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33341.94s)]
*  The technology is not the limiting factors. [[09:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33344.94s)]
*  What we need to work is on many different aspects, regulation, [[09:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33348.94s)]
*  coordination, the provision of basic infrastructure by authorities to make this reality. [[09:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33353.94s)]
*  I can comment more about that later, but in any case, [[09:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33362.94s)]
*  I think that the tokenization has a big promise into the future. [[09:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33366.94s)]
*  Thanks so much, Agustin. [[09:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33371.94s)]
*  It's really the interplay between innovation, which may go in different directions, [[09:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33373.94s)]
*  and then putting a policy framework and a regulatory structure around that. [[09:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33384.94s)]
*  That is the current juncture in many aspects. [[09:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33391.94s)]
*  So, Nandan, you have worked with Agustin on this concept that you labeled the Finternet, [[09:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33397.94s)]
*  a kind of global payment system that is just as seamless as the Internet. [[09:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33407.94s)]
*  I think 30 or so years ago we couldn't imagine something like the Internet existing, [[09:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33417.94s)]
*  and nowadays it is everywhere. [[09:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33424.94s)]
*  I think the Finternet gets at that idea that perhaps for payments and financial services [[09:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33426.94s)]
*  we could have such a seamless object. [[09:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33433.94s)]
*  So explain a little bit more your thinking around that, [[09:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33438.94s)]
*  and particularly this intersection between the public and the private sector in that regard. [[09:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33441.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33448.94s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33449.94s)]
*  I think technology has been integral to financial services for several decades, [[09:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33450.94s)]
*  and we have seen that, whether it's in banking, the branch, you now go to a mobile phone app, [[09:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33457.94s)]
*  payments are becoming instant, you can order an ETF or a mutual fund on a phone. [[09:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33464.94s)]
*  So clearly the financial sector has been the leadership of applying technology to financial services. [[09:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33469.94s)]
*  But all these solutions we have tend to be siloed, purpose-specific infrastructure [[09:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33477.94s)]
*  with their own applications, their own data, their own maintenance, [[09:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33483.94s)]
*  and clearly we have to think about doing some things differently. [[09:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33487.94s)]
*  And I think why we are excited by the idea of tokenization is that it is not about just digitizing [[09:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33491.94s)]
*  the old way of doing things, it's designing a new foundation where money and assets are programmable, [[09:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33498.94s)]
*  portable, and interoperable from day one. [[09:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33506.94s)]
*  That's a huge transformation if we can pull it off. [[09:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33509.94s)]
*  And this is where the idea of the Finternet came in. [[09:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33513.94s)]
*  The thing is that they have a lot of efforts around the world on tokenization. [[09:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33516.94s)]
*  Many central banks are trying to launch tokenized currency. [[09:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33522.94s)]
*  Countries are talking about stable coins. [[09:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33526.94s)]
*  Some people are trying to tokenize bonds, deposits. [[09:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33529.94s)]
*  So we're seeing a lot of work happening. [[09:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33532.94s)]
*  But if we really want to move the needle and get the whole world in a reasonable amount of time [[09:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33534.94s)]
*  to be in this new financial metaphor, then we have to think differently. [[09:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33539.94s)]
*  And the idea of the Finternet came about because Augustine and I met in Bangalore [[09:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33544.94s)]
*  on the G20 meeting in February of 2023. [[09:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33550.94s)]
*  And he had been writing about the Finternet, writing about this new financial architecture. [[09:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33554.94s)]
*  And my colleagues and I, Pramod, Siddharth, and myself had been working on population scale systems [[09:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33560.94s)]
*  with billions of users and billions of transactions over the last several years. [[09:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33567.94s)]
*  So we got together and said, can we apply that population scale generic approach to tokenization? [[09:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33572.94s)]
*  And that's how was born the idea of the Finternet. [[09:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33580.94s)]
*  And this was a paper which we started thinking about in February 23 [[09:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33584.94s)]
*  and actually published the paper only in April of 24. [[09:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33589.94s)]
*  Now, what we are trying to do is come out with a roadmap on how we can tokenize assets across the world. [[09:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33594.94s)]
*  So basically, there are three important ways we look at it. [[09:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33604.94s)]
*  One is we should design this to be user-centric. [[09:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33608.94s)]
*  It's not about institutions. [[09:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33612.94s)]
*  It's about putting the power of tokenization in the hands of the user, [[09:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33614.94s)]
*  where the user can buy, sell, transfer assets of any type. [[09:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33619.94s)]
*  So user-centricity is a big fundamental belief in the Finternet. [[09:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33625.94s)]
*  The second is it should be a unified architecture for all types of assets. [[09:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33630.94s)]
*  In other words, whether the asset is money or securities, property, liabilities, whatever it is, bonds, [[09:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33637.94s)]
*  they should all be able to work with the same infrastructure. [[09:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33645.94s)]
*  So this asset agnostic approach is very important to create a unified approach. [[09:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33648.94s)]
*  The third thing is that this is not for any purpose or geography, [[09:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33654.94s)]
*  but to create a universal infrastructure for the world which is capable of doing this. [[09:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33658.94s)]
*  And it should be able to be used anywhere. [[09:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33664.94s)]
*  And we felt that if we put this point of view across, [[09:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33667.94s)]
*  then at least creating a vision of what is possible and how it can be done in a more systematic fashion. [[09:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33671.94s)]
*  Now, it's exactly a year since we released this paper. [[09:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33679.94s)]
*  It was April of 24, and a lot has happened since then. [[09:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33683.94s)]
*  We find that the technology is actually quite mature enough. [[09:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33687.94s)]
*  We thought it was experimental, but we believe it's more mature. [[09:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33691.94s)]
*  Then second is that all of the world, the regulatory momentum is picking up to create a framework for having tokenized assets. [[09:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33694.94s)]
*  And I think there's a sense of possibility everywhere. [[09:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33703.94s)]
*  And as Augustine mentioned, we come from a background of actually getting things done. [[09:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33706.94s)]
*  So that's where we have been working in the last one year. [[09:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33712.94s)]
*  We have created a lot of the basic tools for how this internet would look like, [[09:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33716.94s)]
*  how you do credentialing, how you create wallets. [[09:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33722.94s)]
*  We have a universal information tokenized system. [[09:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33725.94s)]
*  And we're actually demonstrating that you can do transactions at billions of transaction level using public chain technology. [[09:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33729.94s)]
*  But we're not ready to any technologies, agnostic to which technology that we use. [[09:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33739.94s)]
*  And pilots are underway today, both with central bankers and with companies. [[09:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33744.94s)]
*  And we think over the next year, next few months, by the end of by December of this year, [[09:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33750.94s)]
*  we'll actually have enough working technology to show this working. [[09:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33755.94s)]
*  And these are multiple areas, deposits and wallets, ledgers and so on. [[09:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33760.94s)]
*  So I think we believe that the time has come to really implement the internet approach. [[09:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33767.94s)]
*  And if we can work with making it user centric, universal and unified, [[09:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33774.94s)]
*  we're really going to create a financial network that works for everyone everywhere. [[09:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33780.94s)]
*  And it's really a question of moving it now. [[09:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33785.94s)]
*  I think we can demonstrate in the next few months that technology is not going to be the challenge. [[09:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33789.94s)]
*  Technology will be available. It will be available as open source. [[09:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33795.94s)]
*  Any country, any company can use it. [[09:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33799.94s)]
*  It's really about applying it in a regulatory framework for the kind of assets that we want. [[09:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33802.94s)]
*  So that's where we are after one year. [[09:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33807.94s)]
*  And we are very confident that if the world embraces this approach, we can get there much faster. [[09:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33809.94s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much for for that insight. [[09:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33817.94s)]
*  Let me turn back to to Piero and, you know, ask about the broader capital market implications. [[09:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33822.94s)]
*  I think Augustine and Nandan already alluded to to that and Michelle as well. [[09:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33831.94s)]
*  So how do you see sort of like, you know, how what central banks are doing on tokenization [[09:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33841.94s)]
*  linked to the broader capital market developments, you know, that are, you know, oftentimes beyond beyond the normal operational reach of central banks? [[09:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33850.94s)]
*  So, you know, this is this question is particularly interesting for for the European market. [[09:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33863.94s)]
*  You know, we came from a situation where our markets are completely fragmented. [[09:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33871.94s)]
*  I don't even remember how many trading venues we have. [[09:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33875.94s)]
*  I think we are in the order of forty one. [[09:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33880.94s)]
*  We have something like twenty seven CST Europe. [[09:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33883.94s)]
*  It's hard to talk about capital market. [[09:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33887.94s)]
*  You know, in this condition, fragmentation is a high cost. [[09:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33891.94s)]
*  Access to finance is a problem. [[09:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33897.94s)]
*  Market based finance for small enterprises is a problem. [[09:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33899.94s)]
*  So we see our effort in terms of developing a unified ledger or some some new platform based on tokenization as also an effort, an effort to improve the condition of the capital. [[09:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33904.94s)]
*  At least the backbone of a financial capital unified financial capital markets in Europe. [[09:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33921.94s)]
*  And to simplify, I can simplify by thinking to to to the dimension, right? [[09:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33927.94s)]
*  The potential, the transformational potential of the L.T. I think can be clustered in two groups. [[09:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33933.94s)]
*  As Augustine was saying, we can think of things that we already do and we can do it in a more efficient way. [[09:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33939.94s)]
*  And those are the low hanging fruit. [[09:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33947.94s)]
*  And then there is another dimension. [[09:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33949.94s)]
*  What can we do with the L.T. tokenization that we don't do? [[09:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33952.94s)]
*  We cannot do today because of the way we treat money. [[09:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33957.94s)]
*  Now, on the first front is pretty simple, right? [[09:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33962.94s)]
*  For just just to give you some some example, the L.T. would allow you to trade 24 7 360 days. [[09:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33965.94s)]
*  So basically we could have a unified, you know, platform working working around the clock all year long. [[09:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33974.94s)]
*  Second, if you think today the tricky function of the trading is, you know, the negotiation, the settlement and the cost of the three different platform. [[09:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33985.94s)]
*  You know, we could bring on the DLT on the same platform, the three function. [[09:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=33995.94s)]
*  This would reduce reconciliation costs, the time and and data processing. [[09:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34000.94s)]
*  Third, if you think the effort we are making to move to T plus something right through digitalization, [[09:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34007.94s)]
*  the true DLT we could move to T plus zero immediately. [[09:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34013.94s)]
*  So all this at the end of the day would reduce costs and make it a more efficient market. [[09:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34018.94s)]
*  But the key key difference will be the thinking about the L.T. as a new blur, as has been said, for new services. [[09:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34025.94s)]
*  And to me, everything boils down to one single concept. [[09:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34037.94s)]
*  Digitalization changes the nature of money. [[09:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34041.94s)]
*  Money is not any longer a scriptural, is a is a file, a very sophisticated file. [[09:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34044.94s)]
*  But is a file. So on a file you can put all the condition you want. [[09:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34051.94s)]
*  And so you can decide when to pay, how to pay conditional on all possible state of the word. [[09:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34055.94s)]
*  So this is the kind of transformational that we need to implement to make the financial service and the financial sector to a different stage. [[09:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34062.94s)]
*  But let me conclude. This is not an easy road. [[09:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34072.94s)]
*  It's a bumpy road and many things can go wrong. [[09:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34078.94s)]
*  So we need to do it in a very attentive way because we can end up in new fragmentation. [[09:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34082.94s)]
*  We could end up in a system where competition is low and we could end up in a situation where we will be where we will be stuck with the new technology for a long time. [[09:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34089.94s)]
*  So we need something that avoid from mentation, increase competition and make sure that innovation state had even at the infrastructure level. [[09:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34100.94s)]
*  Let me stop here. Thanks so much, Piero. [[09:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34111.94s)]
*  Thanks so much, Piero. And I certainly hear no lack of ambition on this panel. [[09:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34115.94s)]
*  I think Piero really aims at the broader financial market integration. [[09:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34122.94s)]
*  From the nun we heard, you know, a really very foundational innovation around finance. [[09:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34132.94s)]
*  So, Michelle, turning turning back to you, how do you see the role of central banks in all of this? [[09:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34142.94s)]
*  You know, money, of course, is the foundation of the financial system. [[09:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34150.94s)]
*  You know, central banks have a clear mandate. [[09:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34155.94s)]
*  You know, how can central banks help in this, you know, broader transition to a new technological underpinning to innovation? [[09:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34159.94s)]
*  And as you already alluded to, to this tight interconnection with the private sector. [[09:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34170.94s)]
*  Thanks twice. I think central banks do have a role. [[09:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34177.94s)]
*  Our own one of our own strategic priorities at the Reserve Bank of Australia is to help shape the future of money. [[09:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34183.94s)]
*  I don't mean dictate the future of money. [[09:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34189.94s)]
*  I don't mean mandate the future of money, but I think helping to determine the future money is really important from our own perspective. [[09:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34191.94s)]
*  And I think many central banks, we are all in the payment system. [[09:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34199.94s)]
*  We issue bank notes. We're all operating RTGS systems. [[09:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34202.94s)]
*  In our own case, we're also supervisors of financial market infrastructures, which are a very important potential use case for tokenization. [[09:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34207.94s)]
*  So against all that, I think it's incumbent upon central banks to take an interest in this and work with the commercial sector. [[09:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34217.94s)]
*  We need to be working with them, I think. [[09:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34225.94s)]
*  So it's sort of a catalyst role, but it's also a little bit more than that. [[09:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34227.94s)]
*  I think it's a partnership role as well. [[09:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34231.94s)]
*  And I think what central banks can bring and I think what I think of ourselves of bringing is the role of leadership in terms of what's in the public. [[09:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34234.94s)]
*  What's in public policies interests as well, because these things are. [[09:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34246.94s)]
*  Yes, it's commercial, but it's really critical to the economy for all the reasons we've spoken about. [[09:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34251.94s)]
*  So there is a very big public policy interest in this. [[09:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34257.94s)]
*  And well, I think that's what central banks can bring to this. [[09:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34260.94s)]
*  So in our own thinking about this, some of the questions we'll be asking ourselves as we go through these exercises are, for example, [[09:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34263.94s)]
*  how will this innovation promote and be or be consistent with monetary and financial stability? [[09:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34272.94s)]
*  Because that's obviously important to us. [[09:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34278.94s)]
*  What sort of issues are there for the tokenisation of potential asset classes and how will they promote safety and resilience as well as efficiency of markets? [[09:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34281.94s)]
*  So I think these are really important questions and central banks bring that perspective to it. [[09:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34292.94s)]
*  I also think that if central banks come at it from just a very reactive way, I think we'll be completely behind the curve. [[09:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34298.94s)]
*  And we might end up with circumstances which aren't ideal. [[09:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34306.94s)]
*  So, for example, at the moment, we've already talked about the fact that settlement in central bank money is the safest way to do it. [[09:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34309.94s)]
*  It's not the only way, but it is. [[09:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34319.94s)]
*  And a lot of our high value systems at the moment, they settle in central bank money. [[09:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34321.94s)]
*  So if we don't engage with this and think about how the new tokenisation might be, you might pair with payments, then we might get left out of it. [[09:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34326.94s)]
*  And that might not have good results for financial stability and settlement risk. [[09:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34341.94s)]
*  So, again, we think we're not going to drive this. [[09:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34347.94s)]
*  We're not going to tell people what to do. [[09:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34351.94s)]
*  But I think it's really important we're engaged in it, how central banks, central bank money might be used in these circumstances and what the policy implications might be of that. [[09:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34353.94s)]
*  And there's another point here I think is worth making is that other regulatory authorities, for example, [[09:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34366.94s)]
*  prudential regulators, consumer regulators and the government are also potentially interested in all these issues as well. [[09:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34373.94s)]
*  So we need to be thinking about who we're partnering with, the breadth of our stakeholders. [[09:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34381.94s)]
*  Ultimately, these sorts of things are networks. [[09:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34386.94s)]
*  And they need lots of stakeholders cooperating in order to make them work. [[09:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34389.94s)]
*  So that's how I see our role. [[09:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34395.94s)]
*  Thanks so much, Michelle. [[09:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34398.94s)]
*  Thanks, Michelle. [[09:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34400.94s)]
*  And leading on to that, let me turn back to Augustine and ask about the coordination, cooperation across countries. [[09:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34401.94s)]
*  Of course, Michelle mentioned settlement issues, but they're also broader issues around governance and legal certainty, which are extremely important across countries. [[09:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34414.94s)]
*  So how do you see that playing out across countries and not just advanced economies, but also emerging markets and developing economies? [[09:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34432.94s)]
*  Well, it's very important to have coordination, cooperation internationally, but primarily, I would say, at the beginning, nationally. [[09:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34444.94s)]
*  Now, the main coordination has to be between authorities. [[09:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34453.94s)]
*  I think central banks should play a leading role. [[09:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sjmiBtw4vTM&t=34457.94s)]
