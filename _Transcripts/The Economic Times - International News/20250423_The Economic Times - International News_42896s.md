# LIVE | Pierre Poilievre vows to dismantle illegal encampments as Canada heads to polls within a week
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc)
*  Thank you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26.04s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32.36s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34.72s)]
*  Change, change, change, change. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42.32s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=51.84s)]
*  Change so you are safe on your streets. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=61.2s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=63.28s)]
*  The election is coming and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=71.92s)]
*  Change, change for an affordable life, for food and affordable housing. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=80.8s)]
*  Change for a safe life, change for real. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=88.48s)]
*  That's the choice for Canadians. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=92.8s)]
*  After ten long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=94.88s)]
*  It has to change and it's only the Conservatives that will change things. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=113.12s)]
*  Ned Couric in Hamilton East, Stony Creek. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=116.72s)]
*  Dan Muse, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Brant, North. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=119.52s)]
*  Erica Alexander, give her a round of applause. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=132.24s)]
*  She of course is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=140.88s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinser. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=164.8s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=175.28s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=176.96s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=194.72s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  The police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=216.39999999999998s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=223.60000000000002s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=227.84s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=235.92000000000002s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=239.68s)]
*  Over the next four years my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=246.88s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=264.24s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=281.04s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=284.08s)]
*  When they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=290.88s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=296.4s)]
*  I would like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and he wasn't crying. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=307.92s)]
*  Of course that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=324.88s)]
*  Then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=326.88s)]
*  All of a sudden a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=330.64s)]
*  I walked up to the doctor and said, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry so much? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=336.0s)]
*  He said, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=342.32s)]
*  It's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=354.32s)]
*  They took this platform and wrote it for Trudeau. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=358.0s)]
*  Then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=361.68s)]
*  His plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's economic advisor. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=366.88s)]
*  Why would he presume to change anything? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  There is one thing he changed. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=379.44s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=389.92s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=404.96000000000004s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=408.16s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=419.12s)]
*  Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=426.32s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=436.96s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=439.44s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=447.68s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=448.64s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=450.64s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=454.24s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=459.2s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=462.64s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=466.15999999999997s)]
*  And I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=474.0s)]
*  The liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=476.32s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=481.28s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=487.76s)]
*  That was then. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  This is now. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=490.08s)]
*  The past is the past. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=490.71999999999997s)]
*  Forget about it. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=491.91999999999996s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=493.35999999999996s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=496.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=499.35999999999996s)]
*  You know, it'd be nice. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=501.84s)]
*  I frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=502.55999999999995s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=508.48s)]
*  And this is the government of Canada's own report. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=511.6s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=514.08s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=519.44s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=524.96s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=529.44s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=530.8000000000001s)]
*  To believe the things that they say. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=538.4s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing in 2040. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  Owning a home is not a realistic goal for many and inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=547.84s)]
*  A key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=555.68s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=559.36s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=565.6s)]
*  Quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=568.64s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=573.36s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=586.16s)]
*  That people may have to start quote hunt hunt might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=592.96s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=602.8000000000001s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=610.24s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  The last of us, but this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=621.9200000000001s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now, it's for 15 years from now. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=626.8000000000001s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=630.48s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=632.72s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral the liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=635.2800000000001s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=642.0s)]
*  They might he might look different. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=647.6800000000001s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=649.28s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=654.0799999999999s)]
*  For many Canadians is already the reality is funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=663.92s)]
*  Could they really happen in in 15 years? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=674.88s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=677.52s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=684.56s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clear. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=694.0s)]
*  unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=707.04s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=712.16s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=724.0799999999999s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=730.4s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal liberal drug crime, drug criminal justice, border and other policies. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=742.0s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent, gun crime up a shocking 116 percent, extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=769.36s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=773.04s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=776.96s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=779.28s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=786.16s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=794.16s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=799.92s)]
*  Also this week the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=803.28s)]
*  charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=808.0s)]
*  Again he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=813.84s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=819.44s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=827.12s)]
*  For one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=837.76s)]
*  Imagine where we would be today. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=842.3199999999999s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=845.4399999999999s)]
*  Imagine if Conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=850.9599999999999s)]
*  What would have happened and more importantly what would not have happened? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=859.04s)]
*  Sadly these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=862.8s)]
*  For the last 10 years the Liberal government has unleashed this crime [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=866.0s)]
*  with lax laws like C-75 which requires judges release offenders under quote the least [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=870.4s)]
*  onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=879.0400000000001s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=882.4s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest C-5 which allows the repeat offenders to do their sentences in [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=888.24s)]
*  their living rooms, watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=898.88s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=903.6800000000001s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=907.12s)]
*  As Prime Minister I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=911.44s)]
*  the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=928.08s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=934.96s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=937.6s)]
*  unlocked. They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. It was incredible. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=941.44s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=946.4000000000001s)]
*  leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=952.08s)]
*  they can safely do it. You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=957.2s)]
*  hurting anybody. Is this how we keep people safe? We say you give your car to the thief so that he [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=960.96s)]
*  doesn't shoot you or stab you? This is insanity. But of course it is what life looks like after [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=966.8000000000001s)]
*  this lost liberal decade. One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=973.6s)]
*  in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is these horrible homeless [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=981.6s)]
*  encampments. In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=987.28s)]
*  It is unimaginable. It's like something out of the Great Depression. In Toronto, the number of [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=995.12s)]
*  homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. Homelessness is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1000.88s)]
*  up 20% since 2018. Roughly the time it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic advisor in 2020 [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1010.0s)]
*  and what has happened? Homelessness has gone up by 20%. Chronic homelessness up 38%. That is the [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1018.4s)]
*  legacy of this liberal government. The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1025.44s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof and now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1031.12s)]
*  liberal term. Instead, they have abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1036.48s)]
*  back alleys. Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1041.52s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1047.76s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  parks on their way to school. And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1059.6s)]
*  our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1064.56s)]
*  alone. These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1070.08s)]
*  from fentanyl twisted their spinal cords twisted from countless hours hunched over in painful [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1077.44s)]
*  positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1085.9199999999998s)]
*  bodies and their minds. And the liberals just say let it continue. In fact, their policy has been [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1092.72s)]
*  to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1099.68s)]
*  bureaucracy and interest groups employed expanding this problem. These homeless [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1107.28s)]
*  encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. Doubling housing [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1114.0s)]
*  costs out of control food prices which put people under economic strain and of course rampant [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1119.92s)]
*  liberalization of drugs and crime which allow the chaos to expand. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1126.48s)]
*  Let me be clear letting these tent cities spread is not compassion it is chaos. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1179.92s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro-drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1207.8400000000001s)]
*  pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1214.0800000000002s)]
*  victims with no other options. No nothing for treatment nothing for recovery no attempt to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1219.5200000000002s)]
*  actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1226.0s)]
*  Carney who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1234.32s)]
*  the last five years. A new conservative government will end the chaos and restore [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  Canada's promise for a change. Public spaces must be safe for everyone. We will take back our [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1245.6s)]
*  streets and restore order in our communities and we will give people that that are currently trapped [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1262.0s)]
*  in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. A life with a home with nutritious food [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1268.32s)]
*  physical exercise connections to family a new chance to start over. It's going to be a future [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1275.6s)]

*  will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream the Canadian promise and they will have a [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1287.84s)]
*  superpower when they come from these backgrounds they will have a superpower that they have lived [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1294.1599999999999s)]

*  they will enjoy their lives. So our plan is clear first we will amend the criminal code to give [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1303.28s)]
*  police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1308.8s)]
*  and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1313.9199999999998s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers the powers will be right [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1319.6s)]
*  there in the criminal code. No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1325.76s)]
*  who are too afraid to take action. Second we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1331.6s)]

*  will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  condemned them to that homelessness in the first place and and for more serious criminals [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1393.2s)]
*  where addiction is a factor in their crime but where their crime requires they do jail time [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1408.0800000000002s)]
*  we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence and there will [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1413.52s)]

*  many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. This [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1951.62s)]
*  has really attacked our local independent media. And maybe that's the goal with out [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1959.22s)]
*  of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. Liberals are [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1964.74s)]
*  trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. Their entire campaign is [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1971.54s)]
*  based on making you forget what happened over the last ten years of liberal government and [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1975.82s)]
*  forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1983.06s)]
*  out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1990.9s)]
*  continue on the current liberal track. So it's not surprising that liberals would want to [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=1998.5800000000002s)]
*  shut out discussion on that. But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. What we need [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2003.7800000000002s)]
*  is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2010.3400000000001s)]

*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. You had said previously that your [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2031.3799999999999s)]
*  government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. I'm wondering if you can commit [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2035.62s)]
*  to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2041.06s)]
*  government subsidies from the government. I can commit to that. I said that in my platform you [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2047.46s)]
*  can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism including the local [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2052.34s)]
*  journalism initiative and we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2059.54s)]
*  of government advertising. It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favoured media outlets. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2065.46s)]
*  The Liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2074.1s)]
*  insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos Liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2081.54s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth Liberal term. It's not just local media that are [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2089.06s)]
*  suffering under the Liberals, it's everybody. It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2094.98s)]
*  the steel workers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2099.94s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2106.1s)]
*  the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. And we're not, they also want you to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2112.42s)]
*  forget about the next 15 years if these, if the Liberal policies remain in place. We need strong [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2120.58s)]
*  independent media so that Canadians get all the information. We need to change. This election [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2126.82s)]
*  really comes down to one word, it's change. Change, change, change. Change so you can afford food, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2134.7400000000002s)]
*  change so you can afford homes, change so that you are safe in your street. This election is about [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2141.5400000000004s)]
*  change. Thank you. Thank you. Next question. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2147.06s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone of your [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2158.26s)]
*  platform. One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2164.98s)]
*  you know, some 16-year-old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2172.98s)]
*  you know, he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun? You know, if he survived, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2179.14s)]
*  was he only going to do 18 months? What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2184.98s)]
*  There do need to be, thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2193.86s)]
*  another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2199.06s)]
*  lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. You know, our kids are now [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2206.5s)]
*  more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. Their parents are stressed out and [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2213.54s)]
*  exhausted. There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2221.46s)]
*  the poorest borders and there's more poverty. 25% of our people live in poverty after [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2226.74s)]
*  the lost liberal decade and so our youth have never been so vulnerable [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2234.02s)]
*  and I think if we elect the liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2240.18s)]
*  young people. More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition but we can't afford [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2244.18s)]
*  a fourth liberal term. We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2252.1s)]
*  stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. We [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2257.54s)]
*  need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. I think one of the things I've [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2264.3399999999997s)]
*  noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved and it wasn't always the case for [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2271.7s)]
*  conservatives. Well, why is it? Because we're giving young people hope, a hope that they're [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2278.9s)]
*  going to have a better future, real hope for a change. I want every young person in this country [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2283.62s)]
*  to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2296.26s)]
*  a job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2301.2999999999997s)]
*  succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2309.22s)]
*  parents. That is the beautiful future that we have. I call it the Canadian promise. Let's bring it home [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2315.06s)]
*  for a change. Thank you. We will now go to the final question. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2320.8199999999997s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Polly. I'm Tria Isri, Global News. Canada could be headed into a recession, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2327.78s)]
*  yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. How do you justify that? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2335.94s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2342.02s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2348.42s)]
*  by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. So I just wonder, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2353.54s)]
*  should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2360.1000000000004s)]
*  a trade war? Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2364.34s)]
*  in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2370.5s)]
*  advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. They are the reckless ones and now what is [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2376.5800000000004s)]
*  ultimately the most reckless of all is in a period of uncertainty. Mark Carney says he wants [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2381.86s)]
*  to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2387.78s)]
*  on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2394.7400000000002s)]
*  drive up the cost of food and fuel. Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2401.54s)]
*  after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2407.7s)]
*  economic growth. It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2415.06s)]
*  We need to unleash. Of course it's. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2421.54s)]
*  What is, what would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2431.54s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. He wants to keep a half of our oil in the ground. He wants [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2435.86s)]
*  to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2441.54s)]
*  elsewhere, Algoma and Evraz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. That is more Liberal [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2448.9s)]
*  recklessness. What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2457.1400000000003s)]
*  development law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel ready zones [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2464.18s)]
*  that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. All of these projects will [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2470.58s)]
*  put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2477.3799999999997s)]

*  released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. Change [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2779.06s)]
*  means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. Change means unleashing our resources so we can [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2786.26s)]
*  stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2791.7s)]
*  Over the next four years my plan will cut 55 billion dollars of bureaucracy, consultants, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2796.3399999999997s)]
*  foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70 percent the liberal deficit that we will [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2804.3399999999997s)]
*  inherit on Monday. By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2812.42s)]
*  for Justin Trudeau. This is not a figure of speech. The platform team of the Liberal Party [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2829.2200000000003s)]
*  wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau and then when they switched him out [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2836.58s)]
*  and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh we've got a little cough there, we're okay? [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2842.74s)]
*  All right, all right. I think he was reacting to the deficit in our Carney's platform. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2851.62s)]
*  You know, you know I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2857.22s)]
*  out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying and of course that's every parent's worst nightmare [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2871.46s)]
*  and then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear and all of a sudden a great [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2876.82s)]
*  cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms and [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2881.2999999999997s)]
*  afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor what did you tell our little infant to make [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2885.22s)]
*  him cry ever so much? He said, well I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2890.4199999999996s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. You know, they took this platform, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2903.3799999999997s)]
*  they wrote it for Trudeau and then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2908.74s)]
*  his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2915.2999999999997s)]
*  economic advisor so why would he presume to change anything? Well there is one thing he changed. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2922.66s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2928.9799999999996s)]
*  add $130 billion more. When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2936.26s)]
*  would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2945.94s)]
*  housing prices even more. In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau, the truth is [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2952.34s)]
*  he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2958.6600000000003s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. Liberal economist Trevor Toom said [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2965.22s)]
*  that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible and Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2971.46s)]
*  not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2978.5s)]
*  re-elected for a fourth liberal term. Now add it all up. Can you afford a fourth liberal term [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2984.42s)]
*  of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? Can you afford that after the lost liberal [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2992.82s)]
*  decade? To pay for it all he would have to raise taxes. There's no question he would reinstate [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=2999.54s)]
*  the tax increases Trudeau had planned. He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. He [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3006.34s)]
*  would stash his cash in overseas tax havens but over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3012.26s)]
*  in the wrong direction and fast. I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3020.42s)]
*  the liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. Now [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3025.78s)]
*  this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3030.9s)]
*  10 years of liberal government. Pretend it didn't happen. That was then, this is now, the past is [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3035.86s)]
*  the past, forget about it. Well, what does the future look like? Not according to me but according [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3040.9s)]
*  to them. Well, they published this report and you know it'd be nice, frankly this is a draw [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3047.94s)]
*  dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. Future lives, [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3053.54s)]
*  social mobility in question. This is the government of Canada's own report. If I had alleged the [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3058.9s)]
*  things in this report the media would be attacking me as outlandish but this is what the government [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3064.7400000000002s)]
*  says the future has in store on our current trajectory and I will emphasize that this is [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3070.58s)]
*  their own words. This is what they have to say. I say that many times just so because the shock [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3077.7s)]
*  value of this report is so massive that you would be, you would find it hard to believe the things [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3082.9s)]
*  that they say. The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent, bills, and [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3089.06s)]
*  groceries on housing. In 2040 owning a home is not a realistic goal for many and inequality between [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3095.06s)]
*  those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic, [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3101.06s)]
*  and political conflict. The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3106.98s)]
*  and decline. It forecasts widespread mental health crises quote if young workers forcing young workers [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3114.18s)]
*  to actually leave the country. If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3120.98s)]
*  to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. It says that people will [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3126.18s)]
*  lose faith in the Canadian project altogether and this the most startling comment of all [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3131.54s)]
*  that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3138.5s)]
*  quote hunt hunt might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3144.02s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3152.2599999999998s)]
*  store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3158.26s)]
*  This sounds incredible like something from a post-apocalyptic television television series like [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3164.26s)]
*  the fallout the last of us but this is not that it is a liberal government forecast and it's not [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3170.1000000000004s)]
*  for a hundred years from now it's for 15 years from now. Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3176.7400000000002s)]
*  No, that is not change that is more of the inflationary spiral the Liberals have brought us over the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3182.98s)]
*  last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3189.86s)]
*  They might he might look different he might use more different buzzwords but it is exactly the [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=3197.1400000000003s)]

*  in Hamilton East, Zony Creek. Dan Muse, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Grant North. Erica Alexander. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5216.74s)]
*  Give her a round of applause. She of course is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5238.38s)]
*  who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5248.22s)]
*  a great Conservative, a powering legend in the Canadian story and we look forward to [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5253.58s)]
*  her carrying on his wonderful legacy. We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5261.3s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5280.54s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5285.860000000001s)]
*  but it's official. The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5291.62s)]
*  the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5298.66s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5311.62s)]
*  the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5315.3s)]
*  that they may not return. They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5320.94s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5327.179999999999s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. Change means unleashing our resources [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5335.259999999999s)]
*  so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5340.7s)]
*  Over the next four years my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5345.700000000001s)]
*  foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5353.620000000001s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5362.98s)]
*  It was actually, this is not a figure of speech, the platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5380.139999999999s)]
*  a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau and then when they switched him out [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5386.459999999999s)]
*  and replaced him with his economic advisor. Oh we've got a little cough there. We're okay? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5392.18s)]
*  All right. All right. I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5401.06s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5414.9800000000005s)]
*  little baby cruise and he wasn't crying and of course that's every parent's worst nightmare [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5421.82s)]
*  and then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear and all of a sudden a [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5426.219999999999s)]
*  great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5430.46s)]
*  and afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor what did you tell our little infant [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5434.54s)]
*  to make him cry ever so much? He said, well I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5439.58s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. You know, they took this platform, they wrote it [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5452.74s)]
*  for Trudeau and then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5458.58s)]
*  because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's economic [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5465.54s)]
*  advisor so why would he presume to change anything? Well there is one thing he changed. In addition to [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5472.66s)]
*  all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5479.78s)]
*  billion more. When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5487.219999999999s)]
*  a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5496.0199999999995s)]
*  housing prices even more. In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau, the truth is [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5501.78s)]
*  he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5508.1s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. Liberal economist Trevor Toome said [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5514.740000000001s)]
*  that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible and Mark Carney arrogantly lashed [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5520.900000000001s)]
*  out not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be re-elected [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5527.06s)]
*  for a fourth liberal term. Now add it all up. Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5534.5s)]
*  trillion dollars more inflationary debt? Can you afford that? After the lost liberal decade, [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5543.22s)]
*  to pay for it all he would have to raise taxes. There's no question he would reinstate the tax [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5550.18s)]
*  increases Trudeau had planned. He would raise other taxes only on others not on him. He would [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5556.34s)]
*  stash his cash in overseas tax havens. But over the last lost liberal decade, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5561.86s)]
*  Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. I don't know if you saw the story this [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5568.82s)]
*  week about the government, the liberal government actually published a report about how the country [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5574.339999999999s)]
*  will look in 15 years. Now this is important because what liberals have been telling you is [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5578.82s)]
*  forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. Pretend it didn't happen. That was then, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5583.46s)]
*  this is now, the past is the past. Forget about it. Well, what does the future look like? Not [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5588.98s)]
*  according to me, but according to them. Well, they published this report. You know, it'd be nice, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5595.379999999999s)]
*  frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5601.78s)]
*  before the election. Future lives, social mobility in question. This is the government of Canada's [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5606.179999999999s)]
*  own report. If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5612.5s)]
*  outlandish. But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5617.22s)]
*  I will emphasize that this is their own words. This is what they have to say. I say that many [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5624.1s)]
*  times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be, you would [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5630.58s)]
*  find it hard to believe the things that they say. The report says that in 2040, more people may [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5636.740000000001s)]
*  struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries. On housing, in 2040, owning a home is not a realistic [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5642.58s)]
*  goal for many. And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5648.58s)]
*  driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. The report paints a terrifying [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5653.86s)]
*  picture of national spiral of depression and decline. It forecasts widespread mental health [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5659.94s)]
*  crises, quote, if young workers, forcing young workers to actually leave the country. If young [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5666.74s)]
*  workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5672.66s)]
*  growing number of older people. It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5677.7s)]
*  altogether. And this, the most startling comment of all, that food prices will become so unaffordable [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5683.94s)]
*  on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5690.66s)]
*  hunt, fish and forage on public lands and waterways. You imagine in Canada where people are to the [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5696.099999999999s)]
*  point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5705.62s)]
*  on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. This sounds incredible like something from a [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5710.66s)]
*  post-apocalyptic television series like the fallout, the last of us, but this is not that. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5716.02s)]
*  It is a Liberal government forecast. And it's not for 100 years from now, it's for 15 years from now. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5723.22s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? No. That is not change. That is more of the [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5729.38s)]
*  inflationary spiral the Liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5735.46s)]
*  with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. He might look different, he might use [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5742.66s)]
*  more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same Liberal agenda. We cannot afford a fourth [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5749.0599999999995s)]
*  Liberal turn. After 10 years of Liberal government, predictions about housing shortages, mental health [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5754.58s)]
*  crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. It's funny, yesterday a CBC [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5760.099999999999s)]
*  post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5766.82s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5773.62s)]
*  of Canadians, that's the way it is now. That's how desperate the situation has already become [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5780.34s)]
*  after 10 years of Liberal government. So the choice of this election could not be clearer. A fourth [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5787.3s)]
*  Liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5794.1s)]
*  or a new Conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5799.46s)]
*  unleash home building and resource development so that Canadians can afford a good life [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5805.9400000000005s)]
*  on a safe street. That's the choice before us today. That's a good choice. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5810.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5817.54s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost Liberal decade, nothing more than the [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5822.98s)]
*  homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5831.22s)]
*  a part of everyday life. The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5838.58s)]
*  that is now overtaking our streets because of Liberal drug crime, criminal justice, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5845.3s)]
*  border and other policies. Violent crime is up 15 per cent, gun crime up a shocking 116 per cent, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5853.62s)]
*  extortion and auto theft up 357 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. And you are the ones facing [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5861.14s)]
*  it on the front lines. The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5871.06s)]
*  in this crowd. They are the ones facing it. Here in Hamilton, an innocent young woman was killed [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5875.3s)]
*  waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. The shot was apparently fired from a passing [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5880.900000000001s)]
*  SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. She was a student studying at Mohawk College with [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5887.860000000001s)]
*  her whole life ahead of her. It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. Also this week the court [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5897.3s)]
*  is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5903.46s)]
*  Greg Piershalla just three years ago. Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5909.54s)]
*  life ahead of him. A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5917.22s)]
*  with holes in their hearts. Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5924.18s)]
*  long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offence when he allegedly [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5930.9800000000005s)]
*  committed this crime. Imagine where we would be today. Imagine where Mr Piershalla's family [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5939.46s)]
*  would be today if he had not been released on bail. Imagine if Conservative three-strikes-your-out laws [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5947.06s)]
*  were actually in place and he had been locked away. What would have happened and more importantly [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5953.620000000001s)]
*  what would not have happened. Sadly these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5959.860000000001s)]
*  years. For the last 10 years the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75 [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5964.5s)]
*  which requires judges release offenders under quote the least onerous conditions at the earliest [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5973.06s)]
*  opportunity. A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a Liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5980.58s)]
*  in place. Liberals brought in house arrest C-5 which allows the repeat offenders to do their [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5985.62s)]
*  sentences in their living rooms watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to reoffend [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5991.3s)]
*  and instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=5997.78s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the Liberal policies in place. He wants to ban hunting rifles [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6002.58s)]
*  rather than banning gun criminals. As Prime Minister I'll listen to law enforcement and work [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6008.18s)]
*  with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous Liberal crime wave of the last decade [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6013.700000000001s)]
*  and bring home safe streets for a change. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6019.54s)]
*  For a change. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6022.0199999999995s)]

*  put law-abiding Canadians first for a change. [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6870.82s)]

*  for Renee Pierre-Fontaine from Turner-Le Nord. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6903.0599999999995s)]

*  Hello, Mr. Poiliev. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6921.0599999999995s)]
*  In this context, the media is refusing to give [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6923.0599999999995s)]
*  its fair share of tax to Canada [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6925.0599999999995s)]
*  and is blocking access to the content of our media. [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6927.0599999999995s)]
*  The political parties have still bought [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6930.0599999999995s)]
*  thousands of dollars in pubs on their platforms [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6932.0599999999995s)]
*  rather than supporting our local media. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6934.0599999999995s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6937.0599999999995s)]
*  in the face of the C-18 law [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6939.3s)]

*  to indemnify Canadian media [[01:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6943.3s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6948.3s)]
*  A good question. [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6950.3s)]
*  After the lost decade of Liberals, [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6952.3s)]
*  we can't even have access [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6954.3s)]
*  to the media articles [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6956.3s)]
*  on Facebook and Instagram. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6958.3s)]
*  The policies of censor of Liberals [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6960.3s)]
*  have killed a lot of media, [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6964.3s)]
*  reduced the number of media, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6966.3s)]
*  and independent media are now [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6968.54s)]
*  blocked from sharing their stories. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6970.54s)]
*  Perhaps that is what the Liberals want [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6973.54s)]
*  after knowing how to inflate inflation, [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6976.54s)]
*  the cost of housing, [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6979.54s)]
*  the crime of the honourable. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6981.54s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6983.54s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6985.54s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth Liberals mandate [[01:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6987.54s)]
*  of inflation, of real estate inflation, [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6991.54s)]
*  of real estate and of crime out of control. [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6995.78s)]
*  It needs to change. [[01:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=6998.78s)]
*  With a new Conservative government [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7000.78s)]

*  to share their information [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7004.78s)]
*  on social media, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7006.78s)]
*  including the issue of accessibility. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7008.78s)]

*  with affordable houses, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7018.78s)]

*  and safe streets. [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7022.78s)]
*  After a decade of Liberals, [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7025.0199999999995s)]
*  the choice in elections [[01:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7027.0199999999995s)]

*  and crime, [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7031.0199999999995s)]

*  our local independent media [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7059.0199999999995s)]

*  with out of control inflation, [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7063.0199999999995s)]
*  rising housing costs, [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7065.0199999999995s)]
*  crime and chaos in our streets. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7067.0199999999995s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7069.0199999999995s)]
*  a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7071.0199999999995s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based [[01:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7073.0199999999995s)]
*  on making you forget [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7075.0199999999995s)]
*  what happened over the last [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7077.0199999999995s)]
*  10 years of Liberal government [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7079.0199999999995s)]
*  and forget what will happen [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7081.0199999999995s)]
*  in the next 15 years [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7083.26s)]
*  if you read this report [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7085.26s)]
*  that was just leaked out [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7087.26s)]
*  that says that Canadians [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7089.26s)]
*  will be forced to forage [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7091.26s)]
*  on public lands for food [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7093.26s)]
*  if things continue [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7095.26s)]
*  on the current Liberal track. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7097.26s)]
*  So it's not surprising [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7099.26s)]
*  that Liberals would want to shut out [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7101.26s)]
*  discussion on that. [[01:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7103.26s)]
*  But a fourth Liberal term [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7105.26s)]
*  is not the answer. [[01:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7107.26s)]
*  What we need is a new [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7109.26s)]
*  government to bring change. Change so you can afford food [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7111.26s)]

*  I would like to actually build [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7128.3s)]
*  on the previous question. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7130.3s)]
*  You had said previously [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7132.3s)]
*  that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7134.3s)]
*  and news outlets. [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7136.3s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7138.3s)]
*  not cut funding for local media [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7140.34s)]
*  and local news outlets [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7142.34s)]
*  that depend so much on grants from [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7144.34s)]
*  the government, subsidies from the government. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7146.34s)]
*  I can commit to that. I said [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7148.34s)]
*  that in my platform you can see it there [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7150.34s)]
*  that we're going to back local [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7152.34s)]
*  independent journalism [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7154.34s)]

*  journalism initiative. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7158.34s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7160.34s)]
*  media get their fair share [[01:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7162.34s)]
*  of government advertising. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7164.34s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7166.34s)]
*  the liberal government's [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7168.38s)]

*  in our communities. But that's [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7186.38s)]
*  exactly why we can't afford a fourth [[01:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7188.38s)]
*  Liberal term. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7190.38s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7192.38s)]
*  under the Liberals. It's everybody. It's small [[01:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7194.38s)]
*  businesses, shop owners, [[01:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7196.42s)]

*  you know, their entire strategy [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7206.42s)]
*  is to make Canadians forget [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7208.42s)]
*  about the last 10 years [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7210.42s)]
*  by [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7212.42s)]
*  limiting debate [[02:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7214.42s)]
*  and distracting. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7216.42s)]
*  They also want you to forget about the next [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7218.42s)]
*  15 years if these, if the [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7220.42s)]
*  Liberal policies remain in place. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7222.42s)]

*  media so that [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7226.46s)]

*  We need to change. This election really comes [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7232.46s)]
*  down to one word. It's change. [[02:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7234.46s)]
*  Change, change, change. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7236.46s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7238.46s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7240.46s)]
*  Change so that you are safe in your street. [[02:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7242.46s)]
*  This election is about change. [[02:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7244.46s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Next question. [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7246.46s)]
*  Hi. [[02:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7254.46s)]
*  Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7256.46s)]
*  My question is [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7258.46s)]
*  the law and order has been a cornerstone [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7260.46s)]
*  of your platform. [[02:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7262.46s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7264.46s)]
*  of is [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7266.46s)]
*  about youthful offenders, particularly [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7268.46s)]
*  given, you know, some 16-year-old kids [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7270.46s)]
*  in the morgue following a shootout [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7272.46s)]
*  with Toronto cops. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7274.46s)]
*  You know, he pulled [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7276.46s)]
*  first and, but what's the kid [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7278.46s)]
*  doing with the gun? You know, [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7280.46s)]
*  if he survived, was he only going [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7282.5s)]
*  to do 18 months? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7284.5s)]
*  What do you [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7286.5s)]
*  think should be done with the [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7288.5s)]
*  young offender issue? [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7290.5s)]
*  There do need to be, thank you very much [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7292.5s)]
*  for your question and the story [[02:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7294.5s)]
*  that you shared is another tragic [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7296.5s)]
*  result of [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7298.5s)]
*  the lost liberal decade [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7300.5s)]
*  of [[02:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7302.5s)]
*  lax criminal justice [[02:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7304.5s)]
*  laws, weak borders [[02:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7306.5s)]
*  and drugs on our streets. [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7308.5s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7310.54s)]
*  vulnerable to [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7312.54s)]
*  gang recruitment [[02:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7314.54s)]
*  than ever before. Their parents [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7316.54s)]
*  are stressed out and exhausted. [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7318.54s)]
*  There's drugs [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7320.54s)]
*  and guns everywhere in our streets that have [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7322.54s)]
*  come in through the poorest borders [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7324.54s)]
*  and [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7326.54s)]
*  there's more poverty. [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7328.54s)]
*  25% of our people live in poverty [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7330.54s)]
*  after the lost liberal decade. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7332.54s)]
*  So our youth have never been [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7334.54s)]
*  so vulnerable. [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7336.54s)]
*  And I think if we elect the liberals [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7338.58s)]
*  to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7340.58s)]
*  worse for our young people. More crime, [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7342.58s)]
*  more danger, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7344.58s)]
*  more inflation, more [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7346.58s)]
*  malnutrition. But [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7348.58s)]
*  we can't afford a fourth liberal term. We need a change. [[02:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7350.58s)]
*  A change to lock up [[02:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7352.58s)]
*  the criminals, secure the borders, [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7354.58s)]
*  stop the drugs, guns and [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7356.58s)]
*  stolen cars from going through our ports [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7358.58s)]
*  and across our frontiers. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7360.58s)]
*  We need to give [[02:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7362.58s)]
*  young people a sense [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7364.58s)]
*  of hope and opportunity again. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7366.62s)]
*  I think one of the things [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7368.62s)]
*  I've noticed about my campaign [[02:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7370.62s)]
*  is how many young people are involved. [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7372.62s)]
*  And [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7374.62s)]
*  it wasn't always the case for a conservative. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7376.62s)]
*  Well, why is it? Because we're giving young people [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7378.62s)]
*  hope. Hope that [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7380.62s)]
*  they're going to have a better future. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7382.62s)]
*  Real hope [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7384.62s)]
*  for a change. [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7386.62s)]
*  I want every young person in this [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7392.62s)]
*  country to reject a life of crime [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7394.66s)]
*  knowing that there's something so much better [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7396.66s)]
*  we have in store for them. A job [[02:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7398.66s)]
*  where they can excel. [[02:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7400.66s)]
*  A business that they can start. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7402.66s)]
*  A community [[02:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7404.66s)]
*  where they will thrive and succeed. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7406.66s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7408.66s)]
*  in the future and give [[02:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7410.66s)]
*  grandchildren to their parents. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7412.66s)]
*  That is the beautiful future [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7414.66s)]
*  that we have. I call it the Canadian promise. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7416.66s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. Thank you. [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7418.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7420.7s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7424.7s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7428.7s)]
*  Tria Izri, Global News. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7430.7s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7432.7s)]
*  yet your platform does not account [[02:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7434.7s)]
*  for this uncertainty. How do you justify that? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7436.7s)]
*  Well, my platform [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7440.7s)]
*  when you say it doesn't account [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7442.7s)]
*  for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7444.7s)]
*  Well, part of your [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7446.7s)]
*  platform projects growth based on [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7448.74s)]
*  projects that have yet to happen [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7450.74s)]
*  by repealing C-69, [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7452.74s)]
*  by having growth with pipelines [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7454.74s)]
*  that could take years. So I just [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7456.74s)]
*  wonder should you have erred more on the side [[02:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7458.74s)]
*  of caution given the fact that we're only [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7460.74s)]
*  a few months into a trade war? [[02:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7462.74s)]
*  Well, listen, [[02:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7464.74s)]
*  first of all, the reason our economy has no [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7466.74s)]
*  growth and has been in a per capita recession [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7468.74s)]
*  for the last five years [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7470.74s)]
*  is because of the policies that [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7472.74s)]
*  Mark Carney advised Justin [[02:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7474.74s)]
*  Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7476.78s)]
*  They are the reckless ones and now what is [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7478.78s)]
*  ultimately the most reckless of all [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7480.78s)]
*  is that in a period of uncertainty [[02:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7482.78s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7484.78s)]
*  keep all of the spending that Justin [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7486.78s)]
*  Trudeau planned and then stack [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7488.78s)]
*  $130 billion more [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7490.78s)]
*  spending on top of that for [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7492.78s)]
*  a total of quarter trillion dollars [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7494.78s)]
*  of extra inflationary [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7496.78s)]
*  debt that will drive up [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7498.78s)]
*  the cost of food and fuel. [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7500.78s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7502.78s)]
*  uncertainty whether we have economic [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7504.82s)]
*  weakness after the [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7506.82s)]
*  Liberals have been in power for three terms, [[02:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7508.82s)]
*  whether it is wise to campaign [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7510.82s)]
*  on [[02:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7512.82s)]
*  economic growth, [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7514.82s)]
*  it's not only wise, it's essential [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7516.82s)]
*  for a change that we grow our economy. [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7518.82s)]
*  We need to unleash [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7520.82s)]
*  corsage. [[02:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7522.82s)]
*  What would be reckless is [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7530.82s)]
*  to do with the same Liberal policies. [[02:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7532.86s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7534.86s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7536.86s)]
*  oil in the ground. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7538.86s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7540.86s)]
*  industrial carbon tax on the steel [[02:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7542.86s)]
*  mills here at Stelco [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7544.86s)]
*  and DeFasco, elsewhere, [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7546.86s)]
*  Algoma and [[02:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7548.86s)]
*  Everaz to shut down our steel [[02:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7550.86s)]
*  industry with taxes. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7552.86s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7554.86s)]
*  What is actually [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7556.86s)]
*  responsible is to unleash [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7558.86s)]
*  our resources by repealing [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7560.9s)]
*  the no development law C-69, [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7562.9s)]
*  getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, [[02:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7564.9s)]

*  The Toronto [[02:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7842.98s)]

*  It means the world to me to have the support [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7860.98s)]

*  The police who put on a uniform [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7864.98s)]
*  and they leave in the morning kissing [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7866.98s)]
*  their kids goodbye knowing that they [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7868.98s)]
*  may not return. They do all of that [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7870.98s)]
*  so that you and I can walk [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7872.98s)]
*  our streets safely. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7874.98s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7876.98s)]
*  for change that will make [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7878.98s)]
*  life more affordable and safe [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7880.98s)]
*  in our country. [[02:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7882.98s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7884.98s)]
*  powerful paychecks. Change means [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7886.98s)]
*  unleashing our resources so we can stand [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7888.98s)]
*  on our own two feet and stand up to the [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7890.98s)]
*  world from a position of strength. [[02:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7892.98s)]
*  Over the next four years, [[02:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7894.98s)]
*  my plan will cut [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7896.98s)]
*  $55 billion of bureaucracy, [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7898.98s)]
*  consultants, [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7900.98s)]
*  foreign aid, and [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7902.98s)]
*  liberal waste [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7904.98s)]
*  in order to reduce by 70% [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7906.98s)]
*  the liberal deficit [[02:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7908.98s)]
*  that we will inherit on Monday. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7910.98s)]
*  By contrast, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7920.98s)]
*  we learned that [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7922.98s)]
*  Mark Carney's platform was actually [[02:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7924.98s)]
*  written for Justin Trudeau. [[02:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7926.98s)]
*  This is not [[02:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7928.98s)]
*  a figure of speech. [[02:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7930.98s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7932.98s)]
*  wrote up a platform in the fall [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7934.98s)]
*  and they gave it to Trudeau. [[02:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7936.98s)]
*  And then when they switched him [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7938.98s)]
*  out and replaced him with his [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7940.98s)]
*  economic advisor, [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7942.98s)]
*  oh, we've got a [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7944.98s)]
*  little cough there. [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7946.98s)]
*  We're okay? All right. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7948.98s)]
*  All right. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7950.98s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit [[02:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7952.98s)]
*  in Carney's platform. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7954.98s)]
*  You know, [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7962.98s)]
*  I always like to tell the story of [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7964.98s)]
*  when our little baby boy [[02:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7966.98s)]
*  was born and he came out and [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7968.98s)]
*  little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7970.98s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7972.98s)]
*  And then the doctor came [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7974.98s)]
*  over and whispered something in his ear. [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7976.98s)]
*  And all of a sudden a great cry went out [[02:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7978.98s)]
*  and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay [[02:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7980.98s)]
*  so we held him in our arms. And afterwards I walked up [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7982.98s)]
*  to the doctor and I said, doctor, [[02:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7984.98s)]
*  what did you tell our little infant [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7986.98s)]
*  to make him cry ever so much? [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7988.98s)]
*  And he said, well, I just told him that his share of the national [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7990.98s)]
*  debt was $90,000. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7992.98s)]
*  But [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=7994.98s)]
*  it's about to get a lot bigger under [[02:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8002.98s)]
*  Mark Carney. You know, they took this [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8004.98s)]
*  platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8006.98s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8008.98s)]
*  the leadership and [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8010.98s)]
*  doesn't bother to write his own plan [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8012.98s)]
*  because he has, his plan [[02:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8014.98s)]
*  has been carried out over the last [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8016.98s)]
*  five years while he was Trudeau's [[02:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8018.98s)]
*  economic advisor. So why would [[02:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8020.98s)]
*  he presume to change anything? [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8022.98s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[02:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8024.98s)]
*  In addition to [[02:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8026.98s)]
*  all of the spending that Trudeau [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8028.98s)]
*  had already budgeted for, [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8030.98s)]
*  Mark Carney's plan would [[02:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8032.98s)]
*  add $130 billion [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8034.98s)]
*  more. [[02:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8036.98s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8038.98s)]
*  and Carney's promises, [[02:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8040.98s)]
*  a fourth liberal term would [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8042.98s)]
*  mean a quarter trillion dollars [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8044.98s)]
*  of additional inflationary [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8046.98s)]
*  debt that will drive up food [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8048.98s)]
*  and housing prices even more. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8050.98s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8052.98s)]
*  I've said he's no different than Trudeau. The truth [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8054.98s)]
*  is he will cost even more [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8056.98s)]
*  than Justin Trudeau. He has [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8058.98s)]
*  phantom numbers. He can't explain. [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8060.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8062.98s)]
*  lashing out at even liberal [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8064.98s)]
*  economists. Liberal economist [[02:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8066.98s)]
*  Trevor Toome said that Mark [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8068.98s)]
*  Carney's platform is reckless [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8070.98s)]
*  and irresponsible. And Mark Carney [[02:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8072.98s)]
*  arrogantly lashed out, [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8074.98s)]
*  not wanting people to know how [[02:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8076.98s)]
*  much liberal inflation [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8078.98s)]
*  he would bring if he were [[02:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8080.98s)]
*  to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8082.98s)]
*  Now, [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8084.98s)]
*  add it all up. [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8086.98s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal [[02:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8088.98s)]
*  term of a quarter trillion [[02:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8090.98s)]
*  dollars more [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8092.98s)]
*  inflationary debt? Can you afford that? [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8094.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8096.98s)]
*  to pay for it all, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8098.98s)]
*  he would have to raise taxes. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8100.98s)]
*  No question he would reinstate [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8102.98s)]
*  the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8104.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8106.98s)]
*  only on others, not on him. [[02:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8108.98s)]
*  He would stash his cash in [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8110.98s)]
*  overseas tax havens. [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8112.98s)]
*  But over the last [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8114.98s)]
*  lost liberal decade, Canada is [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8116.98s)]
*  heading in the wrong direction [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8118.98s)]
*  and fast. I don't know [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8120.98s)]
*  if you saw the story this week about the [[02:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8122.98s)]
*  government. The liberal government actually published a report [[02:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8124.98s)]
*  about how the country will look in [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8126.98s)]
*  15 years. Now, this is important [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8128.98s)]
*  because what liberals have been telling you [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8130.98s)]
*  is forget about the last [[02:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8132.98s)]
*  10 years of liberal government. Pretend it [[02:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8134.98s)]
*  didn't happen. That was then, this is [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8136.98s)]
*  now, the past is the past. Forget about [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8138.98s)]
*  it. Well, [[02:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8140.98s)]
*  what does the future look like? [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8142.98s)]
*  Not according to me, but according [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8144.98s)]
*  to them. Well, they published this [[02:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8146.98s)]
*  report. You know, it would be nice [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8148.98s)]
*  frankly, this is a draw-dropping [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8150.98s)]
*  report to be published by the government of Canada [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8152.98s)]
*  before the election. [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8154.98s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8156.98s)]
*  in question. This is the government [[02:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8158.98s)]
*  of Canada's own report. If I had [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8160.98s)]
*  alleged the things in this report, [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8162.98s)]
*  the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[02:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8164.98s)]
*  But this is what the [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8166.98s)]
*  government says the future has in store [[02:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8168.98s)]
*  on our current trajectory. [[02:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8170.98s)]
*  And I will emphasize [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8172.98s)]
*  that this is their own [[02:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8174.98s)]
*  words. This is what they have to [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8176.98s)]
*  say. I say that many times just so [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8178.98s)]
*  because the shock value of this report [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8180.98s)]
*  is so massive that [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8182.98s)]
*  you would be, you would find it hard to [[02:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8184.98s)]
*  believe the things that they say. The report [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8186.98s)]
*  says that in 2040, more [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8188.98s)]
*  people may struggle to afford rent, [[02:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8190.98s)]
*  bills and groceries on housing. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8192.98s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8194.98s)]
*  not a realistic goal for many. [[02:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8196.98s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8198.98s)]
*  and those who own has become a key [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8200.98s)]
*  social driver, a key driver of [[02:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8202.98s)]
*  social, economic and political conflict. [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8204.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying [[02:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8206.98s)]
*  picture of national [[02:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8208.98s)]
*  spiral of depression [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8210.98s)]
*  and decline. It forecasts [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8212.98s)]
*  widespread mental health crises, [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8214.98s)]
*  quote, if young workers, [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8216.98s)]
*  forcing young workers to actually leave [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8218.98s)]
*  the country. If young workers leave [[02:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8220.98s)]
*  Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8222.98s)]
*  harder to pay for the systems that [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8224.98s)]
*  support a growing number of older people. [[02:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8226.98s)]
*  It says that people will lose [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8228.98s)]
*  faith in the Canadian [[02:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8230.98s)]
*  project altogether. And this, [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8232.98s)]
*  the most startling comment of all, [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8234.98s)]
*  that food prices will become [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8236.98s)]
*  so unaffordable on the current path [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8238.98s)]
*  that people may have to start [[02:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8240.98s)]
*  hunting, fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8242.98s)]
*  You imagine in Canada, [[02:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8250.98s)]
*  where people are to the point [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8252.98s)]
*  where they can't even go into a grocery [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8254.98s)]
*  store anymore. And they actually [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8256.98s)]
*  have to go forage on public lands [[02:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8258.98s)]
*  in order to scrape out an existence. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8260.98s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something [[02:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8262.98s)]
*  from a post-apocalyptic [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8264.98s)]
*  television series like [[02:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8266.98s)]
*  The Fall Out, The Last of Us. [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8268.98s)]
*  But this is not that. It is a [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8270.98s)]
*  Liberal government forecast. [[02:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8272.98s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8274.98s)]
*  it's for 15 years from now. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8276.98s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8278.98s)]
*  No. That is not change. [[02:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8280.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8282.98s)]
*  spiral [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8284.98s)]
*  the Liberals have brought us over the lost [[02:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8286.98s)]
*  decade. And Mark [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8288.98s)]
*  Carney will continue with every [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8290.98s)]
*  single policy he inherits from [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8292.98s)]
*  Justin Trudeau. He might look [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8294.98s)]
*  different, he might use more different [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8296.98s)]
*  buzzwords, but it is exactly [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8298.98s)]
*  the same Liberal agenda. We cannot [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8300.98s)]
*  afford a fourth Liberal turn. [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8302.98s)]
*  After 10 years of Liberal government, [[02:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8304.98s)]
*  predictions about housing shortages, [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8306.98s)]
*  mental health crises and a loss of hope [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8308.98s)]
*  for many Canadians [[02:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8310.98s)]
*  is already the reality. It's funny, yesterday [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8312.98s)]
*  a CBC [[02:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8314.98s)]
*  post was saying, well, [[02:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8316.98s)]
*  are all of these terrible things in this [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8318.98s)]
*  government report really realistic? [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8320.98s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 [[02:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8322.98s)]
*  years? And to [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8324.98s)]
*  her credit, another journalist [[02:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8326.98s)]
*  said, well, for a lot of Canadians, [[02:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8328.98s)]
*  that's the way it is now. [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8330.98s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation [[02:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8332.98s)]
*  has already become. [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8334.98s)]
*  After 10 years of [[02:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8336.98s)]
*  Liberal government. So the choice of this [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8338.98s)]
*  election cannot be clearer. A fourth [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8340.98s)]
*  term Liberal term with Mark [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8342.98s)]
*  Carney, whose plan is even more reckless [[02:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8344.98s)]
*  and costly than Justin Trudeau's [[02:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8346.98s)]

*  in Hamilton, an innocent young woman [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8426.98s)]

*  the other day. The shot [[02:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8432.98s)]

*  whole life ahead of her. It was a [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8446.98s)]
*  shocking and senseless tragedy. [[02:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8448.98s)]
*  Also this week, the court [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8450.98s)]

*  just three years ago. Again, [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8460.98s)]
*  he was a young man, [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8462.98s)]
*  a heroic young man with his entire life [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8464.98s)]
*  ahead of him, a loving son and brother [[02:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8466.98s)]
*  whose loss has left his family [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8468.98s)]
*  and law [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8470.98s)]
*  enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8472.98s)]
*  Randall McKenzie, one of the [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8474.98s)]
*  accused, had a criminal record [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8476.98s)]
*  a mile long [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8478.98s)]
*  and is so often the case [[02:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8480.98s)]
*  he was out on [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8482.98s)]
*  bail for one violent [[02:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8484.98s)]
*  offense when he allegedly [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8486.98s)]
*  committed this crime. Imagine [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8488.98s)]
*  imagine where we would be [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8490.98s)]
*  today. Imagine [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8492.98s)]
*  where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8494.98s)]
*  if he had not been released on [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8496.98s)]
*  bail. Imagine if conservative [[02:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8498.98s)]
*  three strikes throughout laws [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8500.98s)]
*  were actually in place [[02:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8502.98s)]
*  and he had been locked away. [[02:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8504.98s)]
*  What would have happened? And more [[02:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8506.98s)]
*  importantly, what would not have happened? [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8508.98s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8510.98s)]
*  all too common in recent years. For the last [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8512.98s)]
*  ten years, the Liberal government [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8514.98s)]
*  has unleashed this crime with [[02:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8516.98s)]
*  lax laws like [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8518.98s)]
*  C-75, which requires [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8520.98s)]
*  judges release offenders [[02:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8522.98s)]
*  under quote, the least [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8524.98s)]
*  onerous conditions at the [[02:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8526.98s)]
*  earliest opportunity, a law [[02:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8528.98s)]
*  that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8530.98s)]
*  law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8532.98s)]
*  Liberals [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8534.98s)]
*  brought in house arrest, C-5, [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8536.98s)]
*  which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8538.98s)]
*  in their living rooms, watching Netflix [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8540.98s)]
*  able to walk out the door at any [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8542.98s)]
*  time to reoffend. [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8544.98s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8546.98s)]
*  law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8548.98s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal [[02:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8550.98s)]
*  policies in place. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8552.98s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8554.98s)]
*  rather than banning gun criminals. [[02:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8556.98s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8558.98s)]
*  law enforcement and work with them [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8560.98s)]
*  so that together we can reverse [[02:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8562.98s)]
*  the dangerous liberal crime wave [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8564.98s)]
*  of the last decade and bring home [[02:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8566.98s)]
*  safe streets for a change, [[02:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8568.98s)]
*  for a change, for a change. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8570.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8572.98s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something [[02:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8582.98s)]
*  we took for granted. People in Canada, [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8584.98s)]
*  in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8586.98s)]
*  used to leave their doors unlocked. [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8588.98s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8590.98s)]
*  It was incredible. [[02:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8592.98s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8594.98s)]
*  Chief of Police has to tell [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8596.98s)]
*  Torontonians, leave your [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8598.98s)]
*  car keys next to the front door [[02:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8600.98s)]
*  so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8602.98s)]
*  they can safely do it. [[02:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8604.98s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8606.98s)]
*  without hurting anybody. Is this [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8608.98s)]
*  how we keep people safe? [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8610.98s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8612.98s)]
*  that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[02:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8614.98s)]
*  This is insanity. [[02:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8616.98s)]
*  But of course it is what life [[02:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8618.98s)]
*  looks like after this lost liberal [[02:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8620.98s)]
*  decade. One of the most visible [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8622.98s)]
*  signs of this total [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8624.98s)]
*  meltdown that [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8626.98s)]
*  liberals admit in their own reports [[02:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8628.98s)]
*  is going to worsen on the current [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8630.98s)]
*  path is the horrible [[02:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8632.98s)]
*  homeless encampments. [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8634.98s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8636.98s)]
*  the lost liberal decade, there are [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8638.98s)]
*  1,400 homeless [[02:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8640.98s)]
*  encampments. It is unimaginable. [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8642.98s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8644.98s)]
*  Depression. In Toronto, the [[02:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8646.98s)]
*  number of homeless encampments more than [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8648.98s)]
*  doubled in just one year, [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8650.98s)]
*  from 82 in 2023 [[02:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8652.98s)]
*  to 200 today. [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8654.98s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% [[02:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8656.98s)]
*  since 2018. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8658.98s)]
*  Roughly the time, it's interesting, [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8660.98s)]
*  Mark Carney became the economic advisor [[02:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8662.98s)]
*  in 2020. And what has happened, [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8664.98s)]
*  homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[02:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8666.98s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8668.98s)]
*  38%. [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8670.98s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8672.98s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8674.98s)]
*  chronic homelessness. [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8676.98s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[02:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8678.98s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8680.98s)]
*  for a fourth time and a fourth liberal [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8682.98s)]
*  term. Instead, they have abandoned [[02:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8684.98s)]
*  the vulnerable and condemned them to [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8686.98s)]
*  sidewalks and back alleys. [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8688.98s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8690.98s)]
*  children once played and families [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8692.98s)]
*  once gathered. Our public [[02:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8694.98s)]
*  spaces have become breeding grounds [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8696.98s)]
*  for addiction, violence, human [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8698.98s)]
*  trafficking and crime. [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8700.98s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8702.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8704.98s)]
*  cut through parks on their way to [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8706.98s)]
*  school. And for those trapped in these [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8708.98s)]
*  camps, our brothers, our sisters, [[02:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8710.98s)]
*  our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8712.98s)]
*  in the cold, to overdose [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8714.98s)]
*  and sometimes to die alone. [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8716.98s)]
*  These are places where [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8718.98s)]
*  half-dead contorted bodies [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8720.98s)]
*  lie on the ground on the verge of [[02:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8722.98s)]
*  overdose from fentanyl, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8724.98s)]
*  twisted, their spinal cords [[02:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8726.98s)]
*  twisted from countless hours, [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8728.98s)]
*  hunched over in [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8730.98s)]
*  painful positions [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8732.98s)]
*  that they cannot sense because [[02:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8734.98s)]
*  of the immense power [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8736.98s)]
*  of the poison running through their [[02:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8738.98s)]
*  bodies and their minds. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8740.98s)]
*  And the Liberals just say, let it [[02:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8742.98s)]
*  continue. In fact, [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8744.98s)]
*  their policy has been to supply [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8746.98s)]
*  even more drugs, more [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8748.98s)]
*  opioids, keep the problem [[02:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8750.98s)]
*  going and keep an entire [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8752.98s)]
*  apparatus of bureaucracy and interest [[02:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8754.98s)]
*  groups employed expanding [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8756.98s)]
*  this problem. [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8758.98s)]
*  These homeless encampments [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8760.98s)]
*  are a symbol of everything this [[02:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8762.98s)]
*  last Liberal decade has brought us. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8764.98s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8766.98s)]
*  out of control food prices, [[02:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8768.98s)]
*  which put people under economic strain [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8770.98s)]
*  and of course rampant [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8772.98s)]
*  liberalization of drugs and crime [[02:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8774.98s)]
*  which allow the chaos to expand. [[02:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8776.98s)]
*  The Liberals had promised [[02:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8778.98s)]
*  to eliminate chronic [[02:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8780.98s)]
*  itinerants, they rather abandoned [[02:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8782.98s)]
*  vulnerable people and condemned them [[02:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8784.98s)]
*  to live on the sidewalks [[02:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8786.98s)]
*  and in the streets. [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8788.98s)]
*  Camps had invaded [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8790.98s)]
*  the places where [[02:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8792.98s)]
*  children played [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8794.98s)]
*  at the playgrounds and where families [[02:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8796.98s)]
*  gathered in all [[02:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8798.98s)]
*  safety. [[02:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8800.98s)]
*  Our public spaces [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8802.98s)]
*  have become [[02:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8804.98s)]
*  areas that are vulnerable to drug [[02:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8806.98s)]
*  addiction, violence, [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8808.98s)]
*  human trafficking and [[02:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8810.98s)]
*  crime. [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8812.98s)]
*  The shops around the parks have [[02:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8814.98s)]
*  been condemned. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8816.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let [[02:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8818.98s)]
*  their children go through the parks [[02:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8820.98s)]
*  to go to school. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8822.98s)]
*  And those who are prisoners [[02:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8824.98s)]
*  of these camps, [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8826.98s)]
*  our brothers, our sisters, [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8828.98s)]
*  our neighbors, are left [[02:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8830.98s)]
*  to themselves in the cold [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8832.98s)]
*  where they risk dying [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8834.98s)]
*  of overdose, alone. [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8836.98s)]
*  It is not compassion, [[02:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8838.98s)]
*  it is cruelty [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8840.98s)]
*  that people live after [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8842.98s)]
*  ten long years of the Liberals. [[02:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8844.98s)]
*  Let me be clear, [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8846.98s)]
*  letting these tent cities [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8848.98s)]
*  spread is not [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8850.98s)]
*  compassion, it is chaos. [[02:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8852.98s)]
*  And it is the direct result [[02:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8854.98s)]
*  of Liberals' pro-drug [[02:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8856.98s)]
*  agenda, policies that have [[02:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8858.98s)]
*  legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic [[02:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8860.98s)]
*  narcotics into our streets under the failed [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8862.98s)]
*  banner of safe supply [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8864.98s)]
*  and then left the victims with no other [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8866.98s)]
*  options. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8868.98s)]
*  Nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8870.98s)]
*  no attempt to actually get people [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8872.98s)]
*  off drugs and no change [[02:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8874.98s)]
*  whatsoever to this policy [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8876.98s)]
*  proposed by [[02:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8878.98s)]
*  Mark Carney, [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8880.98s)]
*  who wants to continue the exact same [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8882.98s)]
*  policies that [[02:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8884.98s)]
*  he advised Justin Trudeau [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8886.98s)]
*  over the last five years. A new Conservative [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8888.98s)]
*  government will end the chaos [[02:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8890.98s)]
*  and restore Canada's promise [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8892.98s)]
*  for a change. Public spaces [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8894.98s)]
*  ... [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8896.98s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8906.98s)]
*  We will take back our streets [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8908.98s)]
*  and restore order [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8910.98s)]
*  in our communities and we will give people [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8912.98s)]
*  that are currently trapped in [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8914.98s)]
*  these awful circumstances [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8916.98s)]
*  a pathway to a better life, [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8918.98s)]
*  a life with a home, with nutritious [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8920.98s)]
*  food, physical exercise, [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8922.98s)]
*  connections to family, [[02:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8924.98s)]
*  a new chance to start over. [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8926.98s)]
*  It's going to be a future of [[02:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8928.98s)]
*  hope and the people who come out [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8930.98s)]
*  of these encampments into [[02:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8932.98s)]
*  from out of the shadows they will come into the [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8934.98s)]
*  light and enjoy the Canadian [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8936.98s)]
*  dream, the Canadian promise. [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8938.98s)]
*  And they will have a superpower [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8940.98s)]
*  when they come from these backgrounds. [[02:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8942.98s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8944.98s)]
*  through the worst valleys and now [[02:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8946.98s)]
*  they can appreciate the summit [[02:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8948.98s)]
*  on which they will enjoy their lives. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8950.98s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[02:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8952.98s)]
*  First we will amend the criminal code [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8954.98s)]
*  to give police legal powers so [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8956.98s)]
*  that they can remove individuals who are a danger [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8958.98s)]
*  to public safety and clear public [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8960.98s)]
*  spaces where access is [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8962.98s)]
*  currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8964.98s)]
*  No more [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8966.98s)]
*  excuses by politicians [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8968.98s)]
*  claiming they don't have the powers. [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8970.98s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8972.98s)]
*  code. No more paralysis [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8974.98s)]
*  from politically correct liberal [[02:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8976.98s)]
*  politicians who are too frayed [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8978.98s)]
*  to take action. Second, [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8980.98s)]
*  we will provide addiction treatment to [[02:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8982.98s)]
*  50,000 Canadians. We will return [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8984.98s)]
*  a true housing first model, [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8986.98s)]
*  get people into a home, [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8988.98s)]
*  but if their addiction is [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8990.98s)]
*  a thing preventing them from succeeding in that [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8992.98s)]
*  home, we will get them into addiction [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8994.98s)]
*  treatment. We will treat the problem. [[02:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8996.98s)]
*  We will offer mental health supports, [[02:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=8998.98s)]
*  job training so police can connect the [[02:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9000.98s)]
*  people in these camps with the care [[02:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9002.98s)]
*  and the housing they need. Third, [[02:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9004.98s)]
*  where appropriate, the occupants [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9006.98s)]
*  will face criminal charges [[02:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9008.98s)]
*  but we will give [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9010.98s)]
*  judges the power to order the people [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9012.98s)]
*  charged for illegally occupying [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9014.98s)]
*  these public places. A [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9016.98s)]
*  simple possession charge that [[02:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9018.98s)]
*  requires they go into treatment. [[02:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9020.98s)]
*  So we're not here [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9022.98s)]
*  to, we're here to give people a way [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9024.98s)]
*  out. If someone is illegally [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9026.98s)]
*  occupying a public [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9028.98s)]
*  space, then we will allow [[02:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9030.98s)]
*  judges to give them [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9032.98s)]
*  a sentence of [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9034.98s)]
*  drug treatment [[02:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9036.98s)]
*  that will get them off the poisons [[02:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9038.98s)]
*  that condemn them to that homelessness [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9040.98s)]
*  in the first place. [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9042.98s)]
*  And... [[02:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9044.98s)]
*  And... [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9046.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals, where [[02:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9054.98s)]
*  addiction is a factor in their crime [[02:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9056.98s)]
*  but where their crime requires they do [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9058.98s)]
*  jail time, we will allow [[02:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9060.98s)]
*  judges to make mandatory [[02:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9062.98s)]
*  treatment a part of the prison sentence. [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9064.98s)]
*  And there will be regular drug [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9066.98s)]
*  tests for prisoners because we [[02:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9068.98s)]
*  know that if someone comes out [[02:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9070.98s)]
*  continually addicted to drugs, [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9072.98s)]
*  they're probably going to reoffend. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9074.98s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9076.98s)]
*  they're in prison, they're given treatment, [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9078.98s)]
*  recovery services, and [[02:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9080.98s)]
*  they show that they've hit, they pass [[02:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9082.98s)]
*  drug tests again and again and again, [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9084.98s)]
*  then their chance at [[02:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9086.98s)]
*  rehabilitation and becoming a [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9088.98s)]
*  successful part of society [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9090.98s)]
*  is much higher. That's how we're [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9092.98s)]
*  going to restore safe streets for a change. [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9094.98s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope [[02:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9096.98s)]
*  for a change. [[02:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9098.98s)]
*  And that's it. Public spaces [[02:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9104.98s)]
*  must be safe for everyone. [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9106.98s)]
*  We will regain control [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9108.98s)]
*  of our streets and restore [[02:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9110.98s)]
*  order in our communities to make [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9112.98s)]
*  changes. Here's how we're going to do it. [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9114.98s)]
*  First, we're going to modify [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9116.98s)]
*  the criminal code to give [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9118.98s)]
*  the police clear legal powers [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9120.98s)]
*  so that they can [[02:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9122.98s)]
*  arrest people [[02:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9124.98s)]
*  and put the public [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9126.98s)]
*  in danger and [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9128.98s)]
*  release public spaces [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9130.98s)]
*  that are currently blocked [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9132.98s)]
*  by temporary tents and shelters. [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9134.98s)]
*  Finish the excuses [[02:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9136.98s)]
*  by politicians. [[02:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9138.98s)]
*  Secondly, we're going to provide [[02:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9140.98s)]
*  treatment against [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9142.98s)]
*  dependence on 50,000 Canadians [[02:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9144.98s)]
*  and we're going to return [[02:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9146.98s)]
*  to a model that prioritizes [[02:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9148.98s)]
*  housing. That means [[02:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9150.98s)]
*  not only a three-way, [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9152.98s)]
*  but also real support, [[02:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9154.98s)]
*  especially treatments, [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9156.98s)]
*  mental health services, and [[02:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9158.98s)]
*  professional training [[02:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9160.98s)]
*  so that the police can [[02:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9162.98s)]
*  put people living in [[02:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9164.98s)]
*  the camps in contact with [[02:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9166.98s)]
*  the care and housing they need. [[02:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9168.98s)]
*  Thirdly, [[02:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9170.98s)]
*  if needed, the occupants [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9172.98s)]
*  will be subject to criminal [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9174.98s)]
*  pursuits, but we're going to [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9176.98s)]
*  give the judge the power to [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9178.98s)]
*  order the people accused of [[02:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9180.98s)]
*  illegal occupation [[02:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9182.98s)]
*  in public spaces [[02:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9184.98s)]
*  for the simple drug [[02:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9186.98s)]
*  treatment. [[02:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9188.98s)]
*  We're going to give the judge [[02:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9190.98s)]
*  the option to order a treatment [[02:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9192.98s)]
*  against drugs. [[02:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9194.98s)]
*  And for the most [[02:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9196.98s)]
*  serious criminals, whose dependence [[02:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9198.98s)]
*  is a factor in their crime, [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9200.98s)]
*  we're going to give the judge [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9202.98s)]
*  more power to order treatment [[02:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9204.98s)]
*  and common-tax tests [[02:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9206.98s)]
*  inside prisons [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9208.98s)]
*  to counter their [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9210.98s)]
*  dependence and maximize [[02:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9212.98s)]
*  the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9214.98s)]
*  Finally, [[02:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9216.98s)]
*  we will make it possible [[02:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9218.98s)]
*  for people to afford homes again. [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9220.98s)]
*  Our plan will [[02:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9222.98s)]
*  axe the sales tax on home [[02:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9224.98s)]
*  building, incentivize [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9226.98s)]
*  municipalities to cut their [[02:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9228.98s)]
*  building taxes to $1.5 million, [[02:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9230.98s)]
*  and we will also [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9232.98s)]
*  increase the cost of [[02:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9234.98s)]
*  housing in the city. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9236.98s)]
*  We're going to give the judge [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9238.98s)]
*  the power to order treatment [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9240.98s)]
*  against drug-related [[02:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9242.98s)]
*  crimes. [[02:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9244.98s)]
*  We will also allow municipalities [[02:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9246.98s)]
*  to cut their building taxes to [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9248.98s)]
*  knock $100,000 of taxation [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9250.98s)]
*  off the cost of a home. [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9252.98s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities [[02:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9254.98s)]
*  to speed up permits, free up land, [[02:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9256.98s)]
*  and cut development taxes [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9258.98s)]
*  to build 15% more homes [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9260.98s)]
*  per year. [[02:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9262.98s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built [[02:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9264.98s)]
*  on federal lands that are otherwise [[02:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9266.98s)]
*  underused or [[02:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9268.98s)]
*  unused completely. [[02:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9270.98s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9272.98s)]
*  people to have a place to live. [[02:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9274.98s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these [[02:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9276.98s)]
*  camps, they didn't start off with that [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9278.98s)]
*  life, but what has been happening [[02:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9280.98s)]
*  is because there's absolutely no hope [[02:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9282.98s)]
*  for them. [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9284.98s)]
*  They might be a young person who's [[02:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9286.98s)]
*  working 70 hours a week [[02:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9288.98s)]
*  just to afford the rent and food, [[02:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9290.98s)]
*  not saving up a nickel for a [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9292.98s)]
*  future down payment, never [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9294.98s)]
*  know a light at the end of the tunnel. [[02:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9296.98s)]
*  So what happens then? [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9298.98s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness [[02:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9300.98s)]
*  with a dose of [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9302.98s)]
*  the wrong drug, then they're addicted, [[02:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9304.98s)]
*  then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9306.98s)]
*  We have to reverse the [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9308.98s)]
*  housing, the liberal housing hell [[02:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9310.98s)]
*  and inflation that has made life so [[02:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9312.98s)]
*  hopeless for so many. [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9314.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years [[02:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9316.98s)]
*  of liberal [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9318.98s)]

*  a good life for Canadians, the life [[02:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9330.98s)]

*  shun our [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9344.98s)]

*  liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, [[02:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9364.98s)]

*  a new conservative government that [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9368.98s)]
*  will change course on crime [[02:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9370.98s)]
*  and common sense laws. [[02:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9372.98s)]

*  sentences for fentanyl [[02:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9386.98s)]
*  traffickers so they never come out [[02:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9388.98s)]
*  again. They are mass murderers [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9390.98s)]
*  and they will be treated like mass murderers [[02:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9392.98s)]

*  treatment centers filled with hope [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9400.98s)]
*  and excitement for people ready [[02:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9402.98s)]
*  to start their lives. We will give [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9404.98s)]

*  drug free for a change. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9414.98s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change [[02:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9416.98s)]
*  and the chaos for a change. [[02:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9418.98s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9420.98s)]
*  first for a change. [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9422.98s)]
*  That is how we bring hope [[02:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9424.98s)]

*  Let's bring it home. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9428.98s)]

*  Thank you. [[02:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9432.98s)]
*  We will now go to questions [[02:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9440.98s)]
*  and we will start with a call in question [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9442.98s)]
*  from the phone line. [[02:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9444.98s)]
*  Thank you guys. Thank you. [[02:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9446.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9448.98s)]
*  Thank you. And your first question comes from the line [[02:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9450.98s)]
*  of Renee Pierre-Fontaine, [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9452.98s)]
*  Centennial in order. Please go ahead. [[02:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9454.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9462.98s)]

*  Thank you. [[02:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9522.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9552.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9582.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9584.98s)]
*  Yes, look, a great [[02:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9586.98s)]
*  question. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9588.98s)]
*  It was about how [[02:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9590.98s)]
*  after the lost liberal [[02:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9592.98s)]
*  decade many media [[02:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9594.98s)]
*  outlets cannot actually share [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9596.98s)]
*  their information on Facebook [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9598.98s)]
*  and Instagram. [[02:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9600.98s)]
*  This has [[02:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9602.98s)]
*  really attacked our [[02:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9604.98s)]
*  local independent media [[02:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9606.98s)]
*  and maybe that's the goal [[02:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9608.98s)]
*  with out of control inflation, [[02:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9610.98s)]
*  rising housing costs, [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9612.98s)]
*  crime and chaos in our streets. [[02:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9614.98s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9616.98s)]
*  term by shutting out that information. [[02:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9618.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on [[02:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9620.98s)]
*  making you forget what happened [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9622.98s)]
*  over the last [[02:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9624.98s)]
*  ten years of liberal government [[02:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9626.98s)]
*  and forget what will happen [[02:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9628.98s)]
*  in the next 15 [[02:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9630.98s)]
*  years if you read [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9632.98s)]
*  this report that is [[02:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9634.98s)]
*  was just leaked out [[02:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9636.98s)]
*  that says that Canadians will be forced [[02:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9638.98s)]
*  to forage on public [[02:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9640.98s)]
*  lands for food [[02:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9642.98s)]
*  if things continue [[02:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9644.98s)]
*  on the current liberal track. [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9646.98s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9648.98s)]
*  would want to shut out discussion on that. [[02:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9650.98s)]
*  But a fourth liberal [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9652.98s)]
*  term is not the answer. [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9654.98s)]
*  What we need is a new [[02:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9656.98s)]
*  conservative government to bring change. [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9658.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food [[02:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9660.98s)]
*  and homes. Change so there's safety [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9662.98s)]
*  in your streets. Change so that we have [[02:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9664.98s)]
*  freedom of expression. Thank you very much. [[02:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9666.98s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[02:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9668.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9670.98s)]
*  Hi. [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9672.98s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[02:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9674.98s)]
*  Sorry. Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9676.98s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9678.98s)]
*  question. You had said [[02:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9680.98s)]
*  previously that your government would cut funding [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9682.98s)]
*  for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[02:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9684.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9686.98s)]
*  you can commit to not cut funding for [[02:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9688.98s)]
*  local media and local [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9690.98s)]
*  news outlets. That depends so much on [[02:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9692.98s)]
*  grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[02:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9694.98s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9696.98s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see [[02:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9698.98s)]
*  it there that we're going to back [[02:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9700.98s)]
*  local independent journalism [[02:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9702.98s)]
*  including the local [[02:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9704.98s)]
*  journalism initiative. [[02:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9706.98s)]
*  And we're also going to make [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9708.98s)]
*  sure that local media get their fair share [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9710.98s)]
*  of government advertising. [[02:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9712.98s)]
*  It shouldn't only [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9714.98s)]
*  go to the [[02:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9716.98s)]
*  liberal government's favoured media [[02:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9718.98s)]
*  outlets. And you know the liberals [[02:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9720.98s)]
*  want censorship [[02:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9722.98s)]
*  to silence people about the [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9724.98s)]
*  doubling of housing costs, the [[02:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9726.98s)]
*  insane rise of [[02:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9728.98s)]
*  food prices, [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9730.98s)]
*  the crime and chaos liberals [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9732.98s)]
*  have unleashed in our communities. [[02:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9734.98s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't [[02:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9736.98s)]
*  afford a fourth liberal term. [[02:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9738.98s)]
*  It's not just local media [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9740.98s)]
*  that are suffering under the liberals. It's everybody. [[02:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9742.98s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop [[02:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9744.98s)]
*  owners, it's the steel workers [[02:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9746.98s)]
*  here in Hamilton that [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9748.98s)]
*  Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[02:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9750.98s)]
*  But we're not [[02:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9752.98s)]
*  going to let them, you know their entire [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9754.98s)]
*  strategy is to make [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9756.98s)]
*  Canadians forget about the [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9758.98s)]
*  last ten years [[02:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9760.98s)]

*  Hi, [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9804.98s)]
*  Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[02:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9806.98s)]
*  My question is [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9808.98s)]
*  the law and order has been a cornerstone [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9810.98s)]
*  of your platform. [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9812.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of [[02:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9814.98s)]
*  is about [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9816.98s)]
*  youthful offenders, particularly given [[02:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9818.98s)]
*  you know some sixteen year old kids [[02:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9820.98s)]
*  in the morgue following a shootout with [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9822.98s)]
*  Toronto cops. [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9824.98s)]
*  You know, he pulled first [[02:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9826.98s)]
*  and but what's the kid doing [[02:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9828.98s)]
*  with the gun? You know, if he survived [[02:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9830.98s)]
*  was he only going to do eighteen [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9832.98s)]
*  months? What do you [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9834.98s)]
*  think should be done [[02:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9836.98s)]
*  with the young offender [[02:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9838.98s)]
*  issue? There do need to be [[02:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9840.98s)]
*  thank you very much for your question [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9842.98s)]
*  and the story that you shared [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9844.98s)]
*  is another tragic [[02:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9846.98s)]
*  result of the lost liberal [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9848.98s)]
*  decade of [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9850.98s)]
*  lax criminal justice laws, [[02:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9854.98s)]
*  weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9856.98s)]
*  You know, our kids [[02:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9858.98s)]
*  are now more vulnerable [[02:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9860.98s)]
*  to [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9862.98s)]
*  gang recruitment than ever before. [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9864.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out [[02:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9866.98s)]
*  and exhausted. [[02:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9868.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9870.98s)]
*  in our streets that have come in through [[02:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9872.98s)]
*  the poorest borders [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9874.98s)]
*  and there's more poverty. [[02:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9876.98s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9878.98s)]
*  live in poverty after the lost liberal [[02:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9880.98s)]
*  decade. So our [[02:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9882.98s)]
*  youth have never been so vulnerable. [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9884.98s)]
*  And I think [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9886.98s)]
*  if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9888.98s)]
*  it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[02:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9890.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9892.98s)]
*  more inflation, [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9894.98s)]
*  more malnutrition. [[02:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9896.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal [[02:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9898.98s)]
*  term. We need a change. A change [[02:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9900.98s)]
*  to lock up the criminals, secure [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9902.98s)]
*  the borders, stop the drugs, [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9904.98s)]
*  guns and stolen cars from going [[02:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9906.98s)]
*  through our ports and across [[02:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9908.98s)]
*  our frontiers. We need [[02:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9910.98s)]
*  to give young people [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9912.98s)]
*  a sense of hope and opportunity [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9914.98s)]
*  again. I think [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9916.98s)]
*  one of the things I've noticed about my [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9918.98s)]
*  campaign is how many young people [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9920.98s)]
*  are involved. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9922.98s)]
*  It wasn't always the case [[02:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9924.98s)]
*  for conservatives. Well why is it? Because [[02:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9926.98s)]
*  we're giving young people hope. [[02:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9928.98s)]
*  A hope that they're going to have a better future. [[02:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9930.98s)]
*  A real hope [[02:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9932.98s)]
*  for a change. [[02:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9934.98s)]
*  I want every [[02:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9940.98s)]
*  young person in this country to reject [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9942.98s)]
*  a life of crime knowing that there's something [[02:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9944.98s)]
*  so much better we have in store for them. [[02:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9946.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel. [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9948.98s)]
*  A business that [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9950.98s)]
*  they can start. [[02:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9952.98s)]
*  A community where they will thrive [[02:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9954.98s)]
*  and succeed. A nice home where [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9956.98s)]
*  they'll raise families in the future [[02:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9958.98s)]
*  and give grandchildren to [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9960.98s)]
*  their parents. That is the [[02:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9962.98s)]
*  beautiful future that we have. I call [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9964.98s)]
*  it the Canadian promise. Let's bring it [[02:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9966.98s)]
*  home for a change. Thank you. [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9968.98s)]
*  We will now go [[02:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9972.98s)]
*  to the final question. [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9974.98s)]
*  Hi Mr. Polly. I'm Trey Esri, Global News. [[02:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9978.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed [[02:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9980.98s)]
*  into a recession, yet your platform [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9982.98s)]
*  does not account for this uncertainty. [[02:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9984.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[02:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9986.98s)]
*  Well my platform [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9988.98s)]
*  when you say it doesn't [[02:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9990.98s)]
*  account for that, can you explain [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9992.98s)]
*  what you mean by that? [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9994.98s)]
*  Well part of your platform projects [[02:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9996.98s)]
*  growth based on projects that have yet [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=9998.98s)]
*  to happen by repealing [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10000.98s)]
*  C-69, by having growth [[02:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10002.98s)]
*  with pipelines that could take years. [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10004.98s)]
*  So I just wonder should you have [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10006.98s)]
*  erred more on the side of caution [[02:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10008.98s)]
*  given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10010.98s)]
*  Well listen, first of all, the reason [[02:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10014.98s)]
*  our economy has no growth and has been in [[02:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10016.98s)]
*  a per capita recession for the last five [[02:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10018.98s)]
*  years is because [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10020.98s)]
*  of the policies that Mark Carney [[02:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10022.98s)]
*  advised Justin Trudeau's liberals [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10024.98s)]
*  to implement. They are the reckless ones. [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10026.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the [[02:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10028.98s)]
*  most reckless of all is that a period [[02:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10030.98s)]
*  of uncertainty, [[02:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10032.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the [[02:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10034.98s)]
*  spending that Justin Trudeau planned [[02:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10036.98s)]
*  and then stack $130 billion [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10038.98s)]
*  more spending [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10040.98s)]
*  on top of that for a total of [[02:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10042.98s)]
*  $1.25 trillion of extra [[02:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10044.98s)]
*  inflationary debt [[02:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10046.98s)]
*  that will drive up the cost of food [[02:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10048.98s)]
*  and fuel. Now you asked [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10050.98s)]
*  me in a period of economic [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10052.98s)]
*  weakness after the [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10054.98s)]
*  liberals have been in power for three [[02:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10056.98s)]
*  terms, whether it is wise [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10058.98s)]
*  to campaign on [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10060.98s)]
*  economic growth, [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10062.98s)]
*  it's not only wise, [[02:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10064.98s)]
*  it's essential for a change that we grow [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10066.98s)]
*  our economy. We need to unleash [[02:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10068.98s)]
*  the corsage. [[02:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10070.98s)]
*  What is, what would be [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10078.98s)]
*  reckless is to continue with the same liberal [[02:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10080.98s)]
*  policies. Mr. Carney [[02:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10082.98s)]

*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the [[02:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10086.98s)]

*  new industrial carbon tax [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10090.98s)]

*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, [[02:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10383.98s)]
*  I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official, [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10387.98s)]
*  the Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[02:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10391.98s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, [[02:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10406.98s)]
*  the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10413.98s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[02:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10420.98s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10425.98s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[02:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10433.98s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10436.98s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and liberal waste [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10443.98s)]
*  in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[02:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10455.98s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[02:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10463.98s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10478.98s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[02:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10481.98s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[02:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10487.98s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[02:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10493.98s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10513.98s)]
*  and he wasn't crying and of course that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10521.98s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[02:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10524.98s)]
*  And all of a sudden a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms. [[02:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10528.98s)]
*  And afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[02:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10533.98s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10539.98s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[02:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10550.98s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau, and then Mark Carney takes the leadership [[02:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10554.98s)]
*  and doesn't bother to write his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years [[02:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10560.98s)]
*  while he was Trudeau's economic advisor. So why would he presume to change anything? [[02:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10568.98s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10573.98s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, [[02:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10576.98s)]
*  Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[02:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10582.98s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars [[02:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10587.98s)]
*  of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[02:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10596.98s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[02:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10601.98s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[02:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10605.98s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10609.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[02:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10612.98s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10616.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring [[02:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10623.98s)]
*  if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10630.98s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[02:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10634.98s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[02:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10637.98s)]
*  Can you afford that? After the lost liberal decade? [[02:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10644.98s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[02:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10648.98s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10651.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10656.98s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[02:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10659.98s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[02:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10663.98s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week with the government. [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10671.98s)]
*  The liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[02:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10673.98s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10678.98s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[02:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10684.98s)]
*  That was then. This is now. The past is the past. Forget about it. [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10686.98s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[02:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10690.98s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10693.98s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[02:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10696.98s)]
*  And, you know, it would be nice, frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[02:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10698.98s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10705.98s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10708.98s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[02:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10711.98s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10716.98s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[02:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10722.98s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10726.98s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find yourself in a situation where you would be in the wrong place. [[02:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10728.98s)]
*  And it's hard to believe the things that they say. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10735.98s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries on housing. [[02:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10737.98s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10744.98s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[02:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10747.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[02:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10756.98s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country, if young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10762.98s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[02:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10776.98s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[02:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10782.98s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10798.98s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10806.98s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout. [[03:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10811.98s)]
*  The last of us. [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10818.98s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[03:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10819.98s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[03:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10823.98s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10825.98s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[03:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10827.98s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[03:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10829.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral the Liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10832.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[03:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10838.98s)]
*  He might look different. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10844.98s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords. [[03:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10846.98s)]
*  But it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[03:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10848.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn. [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10850.98s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10853.98s)]
*  It's funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10863.98s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10872.98s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[03:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10874.98s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[03:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10881.98s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[03:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10888.98s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so that Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[03:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10891.98s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[03:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10909.98s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[03:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10921.98s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[03:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10927.98s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal liberal drug crime, drug criminal justice, border and other policies. [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10938.98s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10953.98s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10955.98s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10959.98s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10966.98s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[03:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10970.98s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10974.98s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[03:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10976.98s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10983.98s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10991.98s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=10997.98s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11000.98s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11011.98s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11016.98s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[03:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11024.98s)]
*  Imagine how imagine what where we would be today. [[03:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11039.98s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11042.98s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your outlaws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[03:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11048.98s)]
*  What would have happened? [[03:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11055.98s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11057.98s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[03:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11059.98s)]
*  The last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under, quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11063.98s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11079.98s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[03:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11085.98s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[03:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11095.98s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11104.98s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[03:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11108.98s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11132.98s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11134.98s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[03:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11138.98s)]
*  It was incredible. [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11141.98s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11143.98s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11155.98s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[03:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11158.98s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11161.98s)]
*  This is insanity. [[03:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11166.98s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11167.98s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[03:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11172.98s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[03:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11185.98s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[03:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11191.98s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[03:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11193.98s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[03:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11196.98s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time the economic adviser in 2020. [[03:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11205.98s)]
*  And what has happened? [[03:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11213.98s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11215.98s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[03:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11217.98s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11220.98s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[03:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11223.98s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[03:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11226.98s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11228.98s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11233.98s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11237.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[03:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11242.98s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11249.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[03:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11251.98s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they're left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[03:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11256.98s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl. [[03:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11266.98s)]
*  Twisted, their spinal cords twisted for countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[03:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11274.98s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[03:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11290.98s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11293.98s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[03:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11308.98s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain, and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[03:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11314.98s)]
*  The children played in the front and where families gathered in all safety. [[03:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11344.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11350.98s)]
*  The businesses located around the parks have been condemned. [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11361.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children pass through the parks to go to school. [[03:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11365.98s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our fathers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[03:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11372.98s)]
*  This is not compassion. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11386.98s)]
*  It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the Liberals. [[03:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11388.98s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11394.98s)]
*  It is chaos. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11401.98s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs, pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no other options. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11403.98s)]
*  No, nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, no attempt to actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[03:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11416.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11436.98s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11442.98s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11445.98s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life, a life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, and a better life. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11449.98s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11462.98s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise, and they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[03:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11465.98s)]
*  They will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11478.98s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys, and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11482.98s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[03:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11490.98s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently available. [[03:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11492.98s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11502.98s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[03:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11514.98s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11519.98s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[03:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11522.98s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[03:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11529.98s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home, but if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[03:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11533.98s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11544.98s)]
*  We will offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11546.98s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges, but we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[03:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11553.98s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. [[03:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11570.98s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemn them to that homelessness in the first place. [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11574.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11591.98s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[03:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11614.98s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11623.98s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11641.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[03:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11646.98s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[03:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11656.98s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and free public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11663.98s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11684.98s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also a real support, including mental health services and professional training so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11699.98s)]
*  Third, when needed, occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, but we're going to give the judge the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug position and the sites. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11718.98s)]
*  We're going to give the judge the option to order treatment against the drug. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11736.98s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we're going to give the judge the power to order treatment and common-sense tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of a real rehabilitation. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11742.98s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[03:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11764.98s)]
*  Our plan will ask the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[03:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11786.98s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[03:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11798.98s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11807.98s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11816.98s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11823.98s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[03:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11826.98s)]
*  What has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11830.98s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[03:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11834.98s)]
*  So what happens then? [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11846.98s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11847.98s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11852.98s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[03:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11853.98s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11856.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11863.98s)]
*  We need a change. [[03:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11870.98s)]
*  And that's why we're here offering that change. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11872.98s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[03:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11874.98s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11876.98s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, [[03:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11881.98s)]
*  where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11895.98s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11905.98s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11915.98s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[03:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11921.98s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[03:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11927.98s)]
*  We will bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11932.98s)]
*  They are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11938.98s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer-funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11943.98s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence-based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug-free for a change. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11953.98s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11963.98s)]
*  Put law-abiding Canadians first for a change. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11967.98s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11971.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. Let's bring it home. [[03:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11975.98s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call-in question from the phone line. [[03:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11983.98s)]
*  Thank you, guys. Thank you. [[03:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11993.98s)]
*  Thank you. Your first question comes from the line for Renee Pierre-Fontaine from Turner-LeNorda. Please go ahead. [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=11995.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12003.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12005.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12035.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12065.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12095.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12125.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12127.98s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[03:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12129.98s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12131.98s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media and maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[03:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12141.98s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[03:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12151.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is about getting rid of the media outlets and trying to get rid of the media outlets. [[03:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12157.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is about getting rid of the media outlets and trying to get rid of the media outlets and trying to get rid of the media outlets. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12165.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is about making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12175.98s)]
*  liberal track. [[03:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12193.98s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[03:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12195.98s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[03:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12199.98s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change so there's safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[03:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12203.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12213.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12215.98s)]
*  Next question. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12217.98s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[03:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12219.98s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[03:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12225.98s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12227.98s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12229.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[03:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12235.98s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12245.98s)]
*  I think on my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local, the local journalism initiative. [[03:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12247.98s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12257.98s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favored media outlets and, you know, the liberals have want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs. [[03:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12263.98s)]
*  Insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[03:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12276.98s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12284.98s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12288.98s)]
*  It's everybody. [[03:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12291.98s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's steelworkers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12292.98s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[03:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12301.98s)]
*  And we're not they also want you to forget about the next 15 years. [[03:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12314.98s)]
*  If these if the liberal policies remain in place, we need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information we need to change. [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12317.98s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[03:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12329.98s)]
*  It's change, change, change, change, change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change that you are safe in your street. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12331.98s)]
*  This election is about change. [[03:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12340.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12342.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12343.98s)]
*  Next question. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12344.98s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[03:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12353.98s)]
*  My question is the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[03:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12356.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12361.98s)]
*  You know, he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun? [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12373.98s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12378.98s)]
*  What what what do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12383.98s)]
*  There do need to be. [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12389.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12390.98s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[03:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12407.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[03:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12414.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[03:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12418.98s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[03:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12424.98s)]
*  25% of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12427.98s)]
*  And so our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12431.98s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[03:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12435.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12440.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[03:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12446.98s)]
*  We need to change a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12448.98s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12459.98s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12464.98s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12471.98s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[03:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12474.98s)]
*  Because we're giving young people hope. [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12475.98s)]
*  Hope that they're going to have a better future. [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12478.98s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[03:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12481.98s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[03:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12489.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12496.98s)]
*  A business that they can start. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12498.98s)]
*  A community where they will thrive and succeed. [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12501.98s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12505.98s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12510.98s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12513.98s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[03:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12515.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12516.98s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[03:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12521.98s)]
*  Hi, Mr. [[03:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12525.98s)]
*  Poliev. [[03:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12526.98s)]
*  Tria Izri, Global News. [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12527.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12528.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[03:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12534.98s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[03:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12537.98s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[03:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12543.98s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12554.98s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12561.98s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12574.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12576.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12581.98s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth. [[03:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12598.98s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[03:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12611.98s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[03:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12616.98s)]
*  Of course it's... [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12618.98s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[03:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12626.98s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[03:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12631.98s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12633.98s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everaz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12636.98s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[03:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12650.98s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the No Development Law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12653.98s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12671.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12680.98s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[03:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12681.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12682.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[03:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12684.98s)]
*  Frank? [[03:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12686.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12688.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12689.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12690.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12720.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12750.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[03:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12770.98s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12777.98s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday, and it comes down to one word, change. [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12779.98s)]
*  Change, change, change, change. [[03:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12787.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12796.98s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12799.98s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[03:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12802.98s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[03:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12806.98s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[03:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12808.98s)]
*  The election is coming, and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12816.98s)]
*  Change. [[03:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12825.98s)]
*  Change for an affordable life, for food. [[03:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12826.98s)]
*  And affordable housing. [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12830.98s)]
*  Change for a safe life. [[03:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12833.98s)]
*  Change for real. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12835.98s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[03:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12837.98s)]
*  After ten long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[03:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12839.98s)]
*  It has to change, and it is only the Conservatives who will change things. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12852.98s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[03:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12857.98s)]
*  Ned in Hamilton East, Stony Creek. [[03:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12861.98s)]
*  Dan Mews, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Grant North. [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12863.98s)]
*  Erica Alexander. [[03:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12876.98s)]
*  Give her a round of applause. [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12884.98s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12890.98s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12909.98s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12919.98s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12926.98s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. [[03:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12931.98s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change, and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[03:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12939.98s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police who put on a uniform, and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye, knowing that they may not return. [[03:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12957.98s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[03:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12968.98s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12972.98s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[03:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12980.98s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[03:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12984.98s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[03:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=12991.98s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[03:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13019.98s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[03:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13026.98s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall, and they gave it to Trudeau. [[03:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13029.98s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh, we've got a little cough there. [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13035.98s)]
*  We're okay? All right. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13045.98s)]
*  All right. [[03:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13047.98s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13048.98s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13060.98s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13069.98s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[03:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13071.98s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13075.98s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13079.98s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[03:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13080.98s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[03:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13087.98s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13098.98s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13102.98s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13105.98s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13116.98s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13118.98s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[03:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13121.98s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13123.98s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13134.98s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13149.98s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13152.98s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13156.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13160.98s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13163.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[03:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13170.98s)]
*  Now add it all up. [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13181.98s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[03:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13184.98s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13192.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, to pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13193.98s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13198.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13203.98s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[03:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13207.98s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13210.98s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[03:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13218.98s)]
*  Now this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13225.98s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[03:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13232.98s)]
*  That was then, this is now, the past is the past, forget about it. [[03:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13234.98s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[03:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13237.98s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[03:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13240.98s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13243.98s)]
*  You know, it would be nice, frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[03:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13245.98s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[03:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13252.98s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[03:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13255.98s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[03:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13258.98s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[03:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13263.98s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13268.98s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13272.98s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[03:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13274.98s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries on housing. [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13283.98s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many and inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[03:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13291.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[03:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13302.98s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country, if young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting, the world's most vulnerable. [[03:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13308.98s)]
*  If you leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[03:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13319.98s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[03:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13325.98s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[03:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13330.98s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13347.98s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[03:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13354.98s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13359.98s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13367.98s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[03:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13371.98s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[03:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13373.98s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13375.98s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13377.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[03:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13380.98s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[03:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13383.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13386.98s)]
*  They might he might look different. [[03:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13392.98s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13394.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortages. [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13398.98s)]
*  Mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13404.98s)]
*  It's funny, yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[03:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13410.98s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[03:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13419.98s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13421.98s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[03:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13429.98s)]
*  So the choice of this election could not be clearer. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13436.98s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[03:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13439.98s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13450.98s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[03:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13457.98s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13469.98s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13475.98s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug, crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[03:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13486.98s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13501.98s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13503.98s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 percent respectively. [[03:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13506.98s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[03:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13513.98s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[03:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13517.98s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[03:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13521.98s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13524.98s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[03:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13530.98s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[03:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13538.98s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13544.98s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13547.98s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[03:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13558.98s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[03:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13564.98s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[03:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13571.98s)]
*  Imagine where we would be today. [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13586.98s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13589.98s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13595.98s)]
*  What would have happened? [[03:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13602.98s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13604.98s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[03:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13606.98s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, [[03:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13610.98s)]
*  which requires judges release offenders under, quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity, [[03:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13618.98s)]
*  a law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[03:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13627.98s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13632.98s)]
*  watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[03:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13638.98s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, [[03:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13643.98s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[03:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13648.98s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13652.98s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade [[03:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13656.98s)]
*  and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[03:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13665.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13673.98s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[03:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13680.98s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13682.98s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13687.98s)]
*  It was incredible. [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13689.98s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13691.98s)]
*  leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[03:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13696.98s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[03:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13703.98s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[03:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13706.98s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[03:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13709.98s)]
*  This is insanity. [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13713.98s)]
*  But of course, it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13715.98s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that Liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path [[03:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13720.98s)]
*  is the horrible homeless encampments. [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13730.98s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[03:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13733.98s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13740.98s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[03:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13742.98s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13744.98s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time, it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13753.98s)]
*  And what has happened? [[03:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13762.98s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[03:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13764.98s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[03:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13766.98s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13769.98s)]
*  The Liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[03:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13772.98s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[03:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13775.98s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[03:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13777.98s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[03:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13782.98s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[03:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13787.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[03:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13792.98s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[03:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13799.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13802.98s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[03:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13806.98s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl twisted. [[03:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13816.98s)]
*  Their spinal cords twisted from countless hours hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13824.98s)]
*  And the Liberals just say, let it continue. [[03:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13839.98s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups in place. [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13842.98s)]
*  And that's why we are so deeply employed expanding this problem. [[03:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13854.98s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last Liberal decade has brought us. [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13857.98s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain and of course rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[03:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13863.98s)]
*  The Liberals had promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[03:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13876.98s)]
*  They rather abandoned vulnerable people and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[03:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13879.98s)]
*  Camps were now invading the places where children played, where people, children played in the front row and where families gathered in all safety. [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13887.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas where people are addicted to drugs, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[03:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13900.98s)]
*  The businesses around the parks have been condemned. [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13910.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children go through the parks to go to school. [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13914.98s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of a single overdose. [[03:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13922.98s)]
*  It is not compassion. It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the Liberals. [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13936.98s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[03:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13944.98s)]
*  It is chaos. And it is the direct result of Liberals pro drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs, pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no other options. [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13950.98s)]
*  No, nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, no attempt to actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13966.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[03:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13986.98s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=13992.98s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life, a life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[03:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14010.98s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. And the people who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14025.98s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys. [[03:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14037.98s)]
*  And now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[03:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14044.98s)]
*  So our plan is clear. First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14049.98s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14064.98s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[03:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14072.98s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14078.98s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[03:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14086.98s)]
*  We will treat the problem. We'll offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[03:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14093.98s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges. [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14102.98s)]
*  But we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[03:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14106.98s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them into a home. [[03:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14116.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory [[03:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14131.98s)]
*  treatment a part of their prison sentence. And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone is illegally occupying a public space, they will be charged with a crime. [[03:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14138.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[03:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14148.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[03:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14160.98s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[03:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14167.98s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14173.98s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14190.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[03:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14196.98s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[03:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14206.98s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and free public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14213.98s)]
*  First, we're going to make the police clear the excuses by politicians. [[03:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14234.98s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14237.98s)]
*  That means not only a roof, but also real support, including treatment, mental health services, and professional training so that the police can put people who are alive in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[03:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14248.98s)]
*  Third, if necessary, the occupants will be the subject of criminal prosecution, but we're going to give the judge the power to order the people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces. [[03:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14268.98s)]
*  For the simple position of drug and the site, we're going to give the judge the option to order a treatment against drugs. [[03:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14283.98s)]
*  And for the more serious criminals whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we're going to give the judge more power to order a treatment and common-law tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14292.98s)]
*  Like that, we're going to bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[03:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14314.98s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will replace it with hope for a better future to make changes. [[03:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14324.98s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14332.98s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14336.98s)]
*  We will incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[03:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14348.98s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[03:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14357.98s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[03:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14366.98s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[03:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14373.98s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14376.98s)]
*  What has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[03:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14380.98s)]
*  They might be a young person who's working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[03:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14384.98s)]
*  So what happens then? [[03:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14396.98s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14397.98s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[04:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14402.98s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[04:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14403.98s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[04:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14405.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[04:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14412.98s)]
*  We need a change, and that's why we're here offering that change. [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14419.98s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[04:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14423.98s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14426.98s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, where people don't shun our downtowns for a change, [[04:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14431.98s)]
*  where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14444.98s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14454.98s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[04:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14464.98s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[04:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14471.98s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[04:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14477.98s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, they are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[04:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14481.98s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[04:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14491.98s)]
*  We will give young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[04:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14501.98s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[04:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14511.98s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[04:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14516.98s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[04:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14520.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14523.98s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[04:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14524.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14528.98s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[04:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14537.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14542.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14546.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14547.98s)]
*  We will now turn to the line for Nathalie. [[04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14548.98s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[04:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14551.98s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Poliev. [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14567.98s)]
*  In this context, the META is trying to get the right part of tax to Canada and block access to the content of our media. [[04:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14568.98s)]
*  Political parties have still bought thousands of dollars in advertising on their platforms rather than supporting our local media. [[04:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14575.98s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives in the face of the C18 law that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14582.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14593.98s)]
*  A good question. [[04:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14594.98s)]
*  After the lost decade of the Liberals, we cannot even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14596.98s)]
*  The policies of censor the Liberals have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. [[04:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14606.98s)]
*  Independent media are now blocked from sharing their history. [[04:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14614.98s)]
*  Perhaps that is what the Liberals want after knowing how to inflate inflation, the cost of housing, the crime of the rich. [[04:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14619.98s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14628.98s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[04:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14630.98s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate of inflation, of real estate inflation, of out of control crime. [[04:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14632.98s)]
*  We need that to change. [[04:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14644.98s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[04:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14646.98s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, safe streets. [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14661.98s)]
*  That is the choice in the elections after a decade of liberal costs and crime that is increasing. [[04:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14670.98s)]
*  Can we allow a fourth mandate or does it need to change to give you a better life in the safe communities? [[04:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14676.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14685.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14686.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14687.98s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14688.98s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14691.98s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14701.98s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[04:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14707.98s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14715.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal trade. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14719.98s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14745.98s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14750.98s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change to their safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[04:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14754.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14765.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14766.98s)]
*  Next question. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14767.98s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[04:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14768.98s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[04:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14773.98s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[04:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14775.98s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[04:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14778.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14783.98s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[04:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14793.98s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local journalism initiative. [[04:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14795.98s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14805.98s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favoured media outlets. [[04:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14811.98s)]
*  You know, the Liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos the Liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14818.98s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth Liberal term. [[04:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14833.98s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the Liberals. [[04:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14837.98s)]
*  It's everybody. [[04:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14840.98s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton. [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14841.98s)]
*  Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[04:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14846.98s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[04:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14849.98s)]
*  And we're not, they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the Liberal policies remain in place. [[04:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14863.98s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[04:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14869.98s)]
*  We need a change. [[04:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14876.98s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14878.98s)]
*  It's change. [[04:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14880.98s)]
*  Change, change, change. [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14881.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[04:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14883.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[04:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14885.98s)]
*  Change so that you are safe in your street. [[04:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14887.98s)]
*  This election is about change. [[04:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14889.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14891.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14892.98s)]
*  Next question. [[04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14893.98s)]
*  Hi. [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14899.98s)]
*  Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[04:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14903.98s)]
*  My question is the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[04:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14905.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16-year-old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[04:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14910.98s)]
*  You know, he pulled first. [[04:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14922.98s)]
*  But what's the kid doing with the gun? [[04:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14925.98s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14928.98s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[04:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14932.98s)]
*  There do need to be. [[04:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14938.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14939.98s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[04:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14956.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14963.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[04:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14967.98s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14973.98s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[04:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14976.98s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14980.98s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[04:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14984.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[04:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14989.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[04:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14995.98s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[04:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=14997.98s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[04:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15008.98s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15013.98s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[04:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15020.98s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[04:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15023.98s)]
*  Because we were giving young people hope, hope that they're going to have a better future. [[04:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15024.98s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[04:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15031.98s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime, knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[04:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15039.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[04:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15046.98s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[04:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15060.98s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[04:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15063.98s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[04:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15065.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15066.98s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[04:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15070.98s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Pauliev, Trey Esri, Global News. [[04:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15075.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[04:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15078.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15084.98s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15086.98s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[04:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15092.98s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[04:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15103.98s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[04:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15110.98s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15124.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[04:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15126.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[04:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15131.98s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[04:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15148.98s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[04:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15161.98s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[04:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15166.98s)]
*  Of course it's... [[04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15169.98s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[04:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15176.98s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[04:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15180.98s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[04:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15183.98s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Evraz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[04:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15186.98s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15199.98s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[04:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15202.98s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[04:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15220.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15229.98s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15230.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[04:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15231.98s)]
*  Ça conclut la conférence de presse. [[04:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15232.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15234.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15238.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15239.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15269.98s)]
*  Amazing. [[04:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15299.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15319.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15320.98s)]
*  It's great to be here in the hammer. [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15326.98s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change, change, change, change, change. [[04:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15328.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[04:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15345.98s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[04:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15348.98s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[04:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15351.98s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[04:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15355.98s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[04:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15357.98s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[04:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15385.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15411.98s)]

*  member of parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great conservative, [[04:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15445.82s)]
*  a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful [[04:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15451.939999999999s)]
*  legacy. [[04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15458.98s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. [[04:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15459.98s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[04:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15469.98s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining [[04:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15476.98s)]
*  me today. [[04:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15480.98s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard [[04:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15481.98s)]
*  this news, but it's official, the Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they [[04:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15486.5s)]
*  are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[04:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15494.22s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police [[04:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15501.22s)]
*  who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing [[04:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15512.22s)]
*  that they may not return. [[04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15517.22s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[04:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15518.66s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in [[04:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15523.22s)]
*  our country. [[04:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15530.22s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15531.22s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15534.22s)]
*  up to the world from a position of strength. [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15538.22s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign [[04:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15541.22s)]
*  aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit [[04:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15550.22s)]
*  on Monday. [[04:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15558.22s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[04:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15560.22s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15576.22s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it [[04:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15579.22s)]
*  to Trudeau. [[04:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15584.22s)]
*  When they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, we have a little [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15585.22s)]
*  cough there. [[04:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15594.22s)]
*  We are okay? [[04:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15595.22s)]
*  All right. [[04:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15596.22s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[04:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15597.22s)]
*  I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15602.22s)]
*  little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[04:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15609.22s)]
*  Of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[04:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15611.22s)]
*  Then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[04:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15614.22s)]
*  All of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be [[04:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15617.22s)]
*  okay, so we held him in our arms. [[04:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15621.22s)]
*  Afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and he said, I'm going to be okay. [[04:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15623.22s)]
*  I'm going to be okay. [[04:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15626.22s)]
*  We were so relieved that he was going to be okay, so we held him in our arms. [[04:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15628.22s)]
*  Afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little [[04:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15631.22s)]
*  infant to make him cry ever so much? [[04:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15635.22s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[04:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15637.22s)]
*  It's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[04:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15649.22s)]
*  They took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15653.22s)]
*  Then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15656.22s)]
*  his plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's economic [[04:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15662.22s)]
*  advisor, so why would he presume to change anything? [[04:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15668.22s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[04:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15671.22s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15674.22s)]
*  would add $130 billion more. [[04:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15681.22s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean [[04:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15685.22s)]
*  a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing [[04:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15691.22s)]
*  prices even more. [[04:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15698.22s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[04:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15699.22s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15703.22s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15707.22s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[04:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15710.22s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible, [[04:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15714.22s)]
*  and Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation [[04:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15721.22s)]
*  he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[04:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15727.22s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[04:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15732.22s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[04:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15735.22s)]
*  Can you afford that after the lost liberal decade? [[04:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15742.22s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[04:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15746.22s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[04:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15749.22s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[04:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15754.22s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[04:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15757.22s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[04:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15761.22s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, [[04:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15769.22s)]
*  the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15771.22s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[04:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15776.22s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[04:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15782.22s)]
*  That was then, this is now, the past is the past, forget about it. [[04:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15784.22s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[04:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15788.22s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[04:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15791.22s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[04:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15794.22s)]
*  And you know, it would be nice, frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[04:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15796.22s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15803.22s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[04:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15806.22s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[04:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15809.22s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[04:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15814.22s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15819.22s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[04:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15824.22s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[04:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15826.22s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[04:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15835.22s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[04:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15842.22s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social economic and political conflict. [[04:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15845.22s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15854.22s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[04:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15860.22s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[04:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15868.22s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[04:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15875.22s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15880.22s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15897.22s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout. [[04:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15909.22s)]
*  The last of us. But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[04:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15916.22s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. It's for 15 years from now. [[04:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15921.22s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[04:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15925.22s)]
*  That is not change. That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[04:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15927.22s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[04:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15933.22s)]
*  They might he might look different. He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[04:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15942.22s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortage. [[04:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15948.22s)]
*  Mental health crisis and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[04:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15954.22s)]
*  It's funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[04:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15960.22s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[04:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15969.22s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15971.22s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[04:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15979.22s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[04:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15986.22s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=15989.22s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16000.22s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[04:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16007.22s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[04:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16019.22s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[04:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16025.22s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug, crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[04:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16036.22s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[04:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16051.22s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[04:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16053.22s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[04:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16057.22s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[04:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16063.22s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[04:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16068.22s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[04:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16072.22s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[04:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16074.22s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[04:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16080.22s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[04:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16088.22s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[04:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16094.22s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[04:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16097.22s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[04:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16108.22s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[04:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16114.22s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[04:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16122.22s)]
*  Imagine how imagine where we would be today. [[04:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16137.22s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[04:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16140.22s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[04:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16145.22s)]
*  What would have happened? [[04:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16153.22s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[04:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16155.22s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[04:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16157.22s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under, quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[04:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16160.22s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[04:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16177.22s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[04:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16182.22s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[04:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16193.22s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[04:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16202.22s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[04:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16206.22s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[04:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16230.22s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[04:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16232.22s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[04:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16236.22s)]
*  It was incredible. [[04:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16239.22s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16241.22s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[04:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16253.22s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16256.22s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you. [[04:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16259.22s)]
*  This is insanity. [[04:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16264.22s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[04:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16265.22s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[04:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16270.22s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[04:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16283.22s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16290.22s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[04:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16292.22s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[04:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16294.22s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time, it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[04:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16304.22s)]
*  And what has happened? [[04:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16313.22s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[04:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16314.22s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[04:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16316.22s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[04:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16319.22s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[04:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16322.22s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[04:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16326.22s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[04:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16327.22s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[04:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16332.22s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[04:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16337.22s)]
*  Our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[04:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16342.22s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[04:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16349.22s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[04:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16351.22s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[04:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16356.22s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl, twisted their spinal cords, twisted from countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[04:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16366.22s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[04:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16389.22s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[04:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16392.22s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[04:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16407.22s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain, and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[04:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16413.22s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas where children used to play in the playgrounds and where families gathered together in complete security. [[04:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16443.22s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas where people are addicted to drugs, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[04:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16451.22s)]
*  The businesses around the parks have been condemned. [[04:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16461.22s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children go through the parks to go to school. [[04:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16464.22s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the time when they risk dying of overdose alone. [[04:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16472.22s)]
*  It's not compassion. It's the cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the liberals. [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16486.22s)]
*  Let me be clear. Letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. It is chaos. [[04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16494.22s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals' pro-drug agenda, policies that have legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply, and then left the victims with no other options. [[04:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16502.22s)]
*  Nothing for treatment. Nothing for recovery. No attempt to actually get people off drugs. [[04:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16515.22s)]
*  And no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16522.22s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[04:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16536.22s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[04:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16542.22s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16560.22s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[04:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16567.22s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. And the people who come out of these encampments into, from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[04:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16575.22s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys, and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[04:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16587.22s)]
*  So our plan is clear. First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[04:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16599.22s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16614.22s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[04:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16622.22s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16628.22s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[04:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16636.22s)]
*  We will treat the problem. We will offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16644.22s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges, but we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places. [[04:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16652.22s)]
*  A simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. So we're not here to, we're here to give people a way out. [[04:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16664.22s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemn them to that homelessness in the first place. [[04:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16673.22s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[04:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16690.22s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they will be able to get out of prison. [[04:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16702.22s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[04:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16712.22s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore the power of the people who are in prison. [[04:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16724.22s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[04:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16730.22s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[04:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16734.22s)]
*  That's how we're going to do it. [[04:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16760.22s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and free public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[04:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16764.22s)]
*  Secondly, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[04:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16784.22s)]
*  That means not only a three but also a real support, especially for mental health services and professional training so that the police can put people who are living in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[04:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16798.22s)]
*  Thirdly, if necessary, the occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, but we're going to give the judge the power to order the people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug position. [[04:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16818.22s)]
*  And for the more serious criminals whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we're going to give the judge more power to order treatment and common-law tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of a real rehabilitation. [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16836.22s)]
*  Like that, we're going to bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[04:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16864.22s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will replace it with hope for a better future to make changes. [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16874.22s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[04:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16882.22s)]
*  Our plan will ask the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[04:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16886.22s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[04:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16898.22s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16907.22s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million homes, affordable homes, to be built for a change. [[04:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16916.22s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[04:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16923.22s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16926.22s)]
*  What has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[04:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16930.22s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[04:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16934.22s)]
*  So what happens then? [[04:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16946.22s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[04:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16947.22s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[04:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16952.22s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[04:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16953.22s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[04:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16955.22s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[04:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16962.22s)]
*  We need a change, and that's why we're here offering that change. [[04:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16969.22s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[04:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16973.22s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16976.22s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change. [[04:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16981.22s)]
*  Where families can raise their children safely for a change. [[04:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16984.22s)]
*  Where seniors can walk without fear for a change. [[04:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16987.22s)]
*  Where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change. [[04:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16990.22s)]
*  Where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[04:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=16995.22s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[04:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17004.22s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[04:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17014.22s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns. [[04:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17021.22s)]
*  Ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[04:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17024.22s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[04:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17027.22s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, they are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[04:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17031.22s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17041.22s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[04:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17051.22s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[04:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17061.22s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[04:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17066.22s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[04:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17070.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17073.22s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17074.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17079.22s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[04:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17087.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17093.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17097.22s)]
*  We will now go to questions from the line. [[04:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17098.22s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[04:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17103.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17108.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17138.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17168.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17198.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17228.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17238.22s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[04:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17239.22s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[04:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17241.22s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media and maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[04:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17251.22s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[04:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17265.22s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 50 years. [[04:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17269.22s)]
*  We are going to be in a situation where we are going to be forced to leave the country for 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal track. [[04:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17281.22s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[04:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17296.22s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[04:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17302.22s)]
*  We want to make sure that we have a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change to their safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[04:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17306.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17316.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17317.22s)]
*  Next question. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17318.22s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[04:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17322.22s)]
*  Sorry? [[04:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17324.22s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[04:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17325.22s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[04:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17327.22s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[04:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17329.22s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[04:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17334.22s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[04:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17344.22s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local, the local journalism initiative. [[04:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17346.22s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17356.22s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favored media outlets. [[04:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17362.22s)]
*  And, you know, the liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[04:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17368.22s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[04:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17384.22s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[04:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17388.22s)]
*  It's everybody. [[04:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17391.22s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17392.22s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[04:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17401.22s)]
*  And we're not, they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the liberal policies remain in place. [[04:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17414.22s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[04:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17420.22s)]
*  We need a change. [[04:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17428.22s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17429.22s)]
*  It's change. [[04:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17431.22s)]
*  Change, change, change. [[04:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17432.22s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[04:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17434.22s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17436.22s)]
*  Change so that you are safe in your street. [[04:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17438.22s)]
*  This election is about change. [[04:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17440.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17442.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17443.22s)]
*  Next question. [[04:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17444.22s)]
*  Hi. [[04:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17453.22s)]
*  Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17454.22s)]
*  My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[04:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17456.22s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17461.22s)]
*  You know, he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun? [[04:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17473.22s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17478.22s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[04:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17482.22s)]
*  There do need to be. [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17488.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17489.22s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[04:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17505.22s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[04:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17513.22s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[04:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17517.22s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[04:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17523.22s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[04:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17526.22s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[04:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17530.22s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[04:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17534.22s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[04:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17539.22s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17545.22s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[04:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17547.22s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[04:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17558.22s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[04:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17564.22s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[04:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17570.22s)]
*  Well, why is it? Because we're giving young people hope, a hope that they're going to have a better future. [[04:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17574.22s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[04:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17581.22s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime, knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[04:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17589.22s)]
*  A job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[04:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17596.22s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[04:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17611.22s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[04:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17613.22s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17615.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17616.22s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[04:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17621.22s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. Triya Izri, Global News. [[04:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17625.22s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[04:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17628.22s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[04:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17634.22s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[04:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17637.22s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[04:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17643.22s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[04:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17654.22s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[04:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17661.22s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[04:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17674.22s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[04:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17676.22s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[04:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17681.22s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[04:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17698.22s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[04:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17711.22s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[04:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17716.22s)]
*  Of course we do. [[04:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17719.22s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[04:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17726.22s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[04:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17730.22s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[04:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17733.22s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everas to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[04:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17736.22s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[04:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17750.22s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law, C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[04:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17752.22s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[04:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17770.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17779.22s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[04:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17780.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17781.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[04:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17782.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[04:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17787.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17788.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17789.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17819.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17849.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[04:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17870.22s)]
*  It's great to be here in the hammer. [[04:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17876.22s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change, change, change, change, change. [[04:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17878.22s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[04:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17895.22s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[04:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17898.22s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[04:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17901.22s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[04:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17905.22s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17907.22s)]
*  The election is coming and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17916.22s)]
*  Change. [[04:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17925.22s)]
*  Change for an affordable life, for food and affordable housing. [[04:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17926.22s)]
*  Change for a safe life. [[04:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17932.22s)]
*  Change for real. [[04:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17935.22s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[04:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17937.22s)]
*  After 10 long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[04:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17939.22s)]
*  It has to change and it is only the Conservatives who will change things. [[04:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17952.22s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[04:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17957.22s)]
*  I would like to introduce our next speaker, Ned Couric in Hamilton East, Stoney Creek. [[04:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17961.22s)]
*  Dan Muse, Glanbrook, Glanbrook, Grant, North. [[04:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17966.22s)]
*  Erica Alexander. [[04:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17983.22s)]
*  Give her a round of applause. [[04:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17985.22s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[04:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=17989.22s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18008.22s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[05:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18018.22s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[05:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18025.22s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's a wonderful night. [[05:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18030.22s)]
*  But it's official. [[05:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18037.22s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[05:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18039.22s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[05:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18049.22s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[05:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18068.22s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[05:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18072.22s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[05:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18080.22s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[05:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18083.22s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[05:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18090.22s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[05:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18108.22s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[05:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18125.22s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[05:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18128.22s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[05:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18134.22s)]
*  I would like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[05:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18161.22s)]
*  And of course that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[05:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18169.22s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[05:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18171.22s)]
*  And all of a sudden a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms. [[05:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18175.22s)]
*  And afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[05:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18180.22s)]
*  And he said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[05:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18187.22s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[05:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18198.22s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau, and then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[05:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18202.22s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. So why would he presume to change anything? [[05:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18216.22s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[05:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18221.22s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[05:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18223.22s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[05:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18234.22s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[05:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18248.22s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[05:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18252.22s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18256.22s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[05:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18259.22s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[05:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18263.22s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[05:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18270.22s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[05:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18281.22s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[05:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18284.22s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[05:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18291.22s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade? [[05:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18292.22s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[05:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18295.22s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[05:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18298.22s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18303.22s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[05:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18306.22s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[05:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18310.22s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week with the government. [[05:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18318.22s)]
*  The Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[05:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18320.22s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. [[05:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18325.22s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[05:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18332.22s)]
*  That was then. [[05:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18333.22s)]
*  This is now. [[05:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18334.22s)]
*  The past is the past. [[05:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18335.22s)]
*  Forget about it. [[05:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18336.22s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[05:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18337.22s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18340.22s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[05:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18343.22s)]
*  You know, it would be nice. [[05:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18345.22s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[05:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18347.22s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[05:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18352.22s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[05:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18355.22s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[05:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18358.22s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[05:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18363.22s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[05:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18368.22s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18373.22s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18375.22s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[05:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18384.22s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[05:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18391.22s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[05:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18394.22s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[05:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18403.22s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[05:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18409.22s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[05:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18417.22s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[05:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18424.22s)]
*  And this, the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[05:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18430.22s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[05:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18446.22s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[05:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18453.22s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[05:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18458.22s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18466.22s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. It's for 15 years from now. [[05:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18470.22s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? No, that is not change. [[05:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18474.22s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[05:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18479.22s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[05:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18483.22s)]
*  They might he might look different. He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[05:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18491.22s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing. [[05:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18498.22s)]
*  Shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[05:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18503.22s)]
*  It's funny. Yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[05:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18509.22s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[05:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18518.22s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[05:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18521.22s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[05:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18528.22s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clear. [[05:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18535.22s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[05:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18538.22s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[05:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18549.22s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[05:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18556.22s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[05:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18568.22s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18574.22s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug crime, drug criminal justice, border and other policies. [[05:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18585.22s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[05:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18600.22s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[05:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18606.22s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[05:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18613.22s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[05:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18617.22s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[05:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18621.22s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[05:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18623.22s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[05:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18630.22s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[05:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18638.22s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[05:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18644.22s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[05:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18647.22s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[05:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18658.22s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[05:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18663.22s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[05:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18670.22s)]
*  Imagine how imagine where we would be today. [[05:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18685.22s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[05:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18689.22s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[05:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18695.22s)]
*  What would have happened? [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18703.22s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[05:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18704.22s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[05:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18706.22s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under, quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[05:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18710.22s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[05:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18726.22s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[05:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18732.22s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[05:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18742.22s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[05:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18751.22s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[05:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18755.22s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[05:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18779.22s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[05:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18782.22s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[05:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18786.22s)]
*  It was incredible. [[05:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18789.22s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[05:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18791.22s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[05:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18803.22s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[05:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18806.22s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[05:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18808.22s)]
*  This is insanity. [[05:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18813.22s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[05:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18814.22s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[05:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18819.22s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[05:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18832.22s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[05:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18839.22s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[05:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18841.22s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[05:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18843.22s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time it's interesting. [[05:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18853.22s)]
*  Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[05:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18859.22s)]
*  And what has happened? [[05:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18862.22s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[05:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18863.22s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[05:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18865.22s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[05:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18868.22s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[05:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18871.22s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[05:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18875.22s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[05:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18876.22s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[05:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18881.22s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[05:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18886.22s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[05:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18891.22s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[05:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18898.22s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[05:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18900.22s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[05:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18905.22s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl. [[05:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18915.22s)]
*  Twisted, their spinal cords twisted for countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[05:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18922.22s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[05:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18939.22s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[05:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18942.22s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[05:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18956.22s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18963.22s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[05:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=18993.22s)]
*  The businesses located around the parks have been condemned. [[05:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19003.22s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children go through the parks to go to school. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19008.22s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[05:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19015.22s)]
*  It is not compassion, it is cruelty that people live after ten long years of the Liberals. [[05:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19029.22s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion, it is chaos. [[05:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19038.22s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs, pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no other options. [[05:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19046.22s)]
*  No, nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, no attempt to actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[05:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19060.22s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[05:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19080.22s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[05:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19086.22s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[05:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19099.22s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[05:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19104.22s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[05:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19111.22s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[05:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19119.22s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into, from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[05:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19122.22s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[05:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19131.22s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[05:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19135.22s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[05:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19143.22s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[05:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19145.22s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[05:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19157.22s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[05:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19163.22s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[05:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19166.22s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[05:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19172.22s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[05:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19176.22s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[05:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19180.22s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[05:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19187.22s)]
*  We'll go for mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[05:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19189.22s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges. [[05:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19196.22s)]
*  But, but we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegal illegally occupying these public places. [[05:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19200.22s)]
*  A simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[05:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19208.22s)]
*  So we're not, we're not here to, we're here to give people a way out. [[05:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19213.22s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[05:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19217.22s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[05:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19234.22s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[05:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19257.22s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[05:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19266.22s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[05:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19284.22s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[05:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19287.22s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. [[05:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19290.22s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[05:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19295.22s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[05:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19300.22s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. [[05:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19306.22s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and free public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary shelters and tents. [[05:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19308.22s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[05:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19328.22s)]
*  Third, we're going to provide the police with the ability to put people in contact with the people who live in the camps and provide them with the care and housing they need. [[05:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19342.22s)]
*  Third, if necessary, occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, but we're going to give the judge the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug position and the sites. [[05:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19362.22s)]
*  We're going to give the judge the option to order treatment against drugs. [[05:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19380.22s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we're going to give the judge the power to order treatment and common-sense tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[05:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19386.22s)]
*  And finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[05:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19408.22s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home, will incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year, [[05:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19430.22s)]
*  will allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[05:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19451.22s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[05:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19460.22s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[05:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19466.22s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[05:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19470.22s)]
*  What has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[05:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19474.22s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19478.22s)]
*  So what happens then? [[05:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19490.22s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[05:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19491.22s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[05:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19496.22s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[05:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19497.22s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[05:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19499.22s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[05:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19506.22s)]
*  We need a change. [[05:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19513.22s)]
*  And that's why we're here offering that change. [[05:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19515.22s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[05:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19517.22s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[05:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19520.22s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, [[05:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19525.22s)]
*  where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[05:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19538.22s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[05:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19548.22s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[05:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19558.22s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[05:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19565.22s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[05:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19571.22s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, they are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[05:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19575.22s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[05:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19585.22s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[05:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19595.22s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[05:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19605.22s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[05:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19610.22s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[05:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19614.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19617.22s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[05:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19618.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19622.22s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[05:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19631.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19636.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19640.22s)]
*  And your first question comes from the line for Pierre Fontaine. [[05:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19641.22s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[05:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19644.22s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Poliev. [[05:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19661.22s)]
*  In this context, the META is just supporting tax in Canada and blocking access to the content of our media. [[05:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19662.22s)]
*  Political parties have still bought thousands of dollars in ads on their platforms rather than supporting our local media. [[05:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19669.22s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives facing the C18 law that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[05:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19676.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19687.22s)]
*  A good question. [[05:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19688.22s)]
*  After the lost decade of the Liberals, we can't even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[05:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19690.22s)]
*  The policies of censor the Liberals have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. [[05:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19700.22s)]
*  Independent media are now blocked from sharing their history. [[05:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19708.22s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they've inflated inflation, housing costs, criminalization of the rich. [[05:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19713.22s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[05:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19722.22s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[05:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19724.22s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth liberal mandate for inflation, for real estate inflation, for out of control crime. [[05:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19726.22s)]
*  We need that to change. [[05:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19738.22s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[05:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19740.22s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, security streets. [[05:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19755.22s)]
*  That's the choice in the elections. [[05:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19763.22s)]
*  After decades of liberal costs and increased crime, can we allow a fourth mandate or does it need to change to give you a better life in the security communities? [[05:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19766.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19779.22s)]
*  In English, please. [[05:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19780.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19781.22s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[05:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19782.22s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[05:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19785.22s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[05:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19795.22s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[05:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19801.22s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[05:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19809.22s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years. [[05:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19813.22s)]
*  If you read this report that is was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal track. [[05:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19825.22s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[05:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19839.22s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[05:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19844.22s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change to their safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[05:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19848.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19859.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19860.22s)]
*  Next question. [[05:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19861.22s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[05:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19865.22s)]
*  Sorry, I can't. [[05:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19867.22s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[05:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19868.22s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[05:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19870.22s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[05:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19872.22s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[05:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19877.22s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[05:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19887.22s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local the local journalism initiative. [[05:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19889.22s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[05:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19899.22s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favored media outlets. [[05:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19905.22s)]
*  And, you know, the liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[05:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19911.22s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[05:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19926.22s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[05:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19930.22s)]
*  It's everybody. [[05:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19934.22s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[05:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19935.22s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[05:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19944.22s)]
*  And we're not, they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the liberal policies remain in place. [[05:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19957.22s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[05:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19963.22s)]
*  We need a change. [[05:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19970.22s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[05:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19972.22s)]
*  It's change. Change, change, change, change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change that you are safe in your street. [[05:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19974.22s)]
*  This election is about change. [[05:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19983.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19985.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19986.22s)]
*  Next question. [[05:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19987.22s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[05:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19993.22s)]
*  My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[05:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=19999.22s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[05:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20004.22s)]
*  You know, he pulled first. [[05:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20016.22s)]
*  But what's the kid doing with the gun? [[05:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20019.22s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[05:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20021.22s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[05:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20026.22s)]
*  There do need to be. Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[05:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20032.22s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[05:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20049.22s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[05:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20057.22s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[05:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20061.22s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[05:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20066.22s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[05:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20069.22s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[05:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20074.22s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[05:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20079.22s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[05:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20083.22s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[05:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20089.22s)]
*  We need to change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[05:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20091.22s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[05:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20102.22s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20107.22s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[05:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20114.22s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[05:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20117.22s)]
*  Because we were giving young people hope, hope that they're going to have a better future. [[05:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20118.22s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[05:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20125.22s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[05:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20133.22s)]
*  A job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[05:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20140.22s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[05:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20154.22s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[05:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20157.22s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[05:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20158.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20160.22s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[05:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20164.22s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. [[05:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20168.22s)]
*  Tria, Global News. [[05:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20170.22s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[05:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20172.22s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[05:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20178.22s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[05:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20180.22s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[05:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20186.22s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20197.22s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[05:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20204.22s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[05:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20217.22s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty, Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that. [[05:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20219.22s)]
*  For a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[05:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20233.22s)]
*  Now, you ask me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[05:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20241.22s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[05:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20254.22s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[05:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20259.22s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[05:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20269.22s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[05:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20273.22s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[05:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20276.22s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everaz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[05:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20279.22s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[05:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20293.22s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law, C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[05:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20296.22s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[05:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20314.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20323.22s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[05:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20324.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[05:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20325.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[05:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20327.22s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[05:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20329.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20332.22s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20333.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20363.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20393.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[05:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20414.22s)]
*  It's great to be here in the hammer. [[05:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20420.22s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday, and it comes down to one word, change. [[05:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20422.22s)]
*  Change, change, change, change. [[05:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20430.22s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[05:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20439.22s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[05:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20442.22s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[05:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20445.22s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[05:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20449.22s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20451.22s)]
*  The election is coming, and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[05:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20459.22s)]
*  Change. Change for an affordable life, for food. [[05:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20468.22s)]
*  And affordable housing. Change for a safe life. Change for real. [[05:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20473.22s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[05:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20480.22s)]
*  After ten long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[05:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20483.22s)]
*  It has to change, and it is only the Conservatives who will change things. [[05:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20496.22s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[05:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20501.22s)]
*  And now, let's welcome our next speaker, Dan Currick in Hamilton East, Stony Creek. [[05:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20505.22s)]
*  Dan. [[05:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20510.22s)]
*  Dan Muse. [[05:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20518.22s)]
*  Erica Alexander. [[05:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20526.22s)]
*  Give her a round of applause. [[05:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20530.22s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[05:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20534.22s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinser. [[05:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20552.22s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[05:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20562.22s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[05:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20569.22s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, [[05:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20574.22s)]
*  but it's official. [[05:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20580.22s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change, and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[05:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20583.22s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[05:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20601.22s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[05:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20611.22s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[05:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20616.22s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[05:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20624.22s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[05:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20627.22s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[05:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20634.22s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[05:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20657.22s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[05:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20669.22s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[05:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20672.22s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh, we've got a little cough there. [[05:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20679.22s)]
*  We're okay? All right. [[05:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20689.22s)]
*  All right. [[05:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20691.22s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[05:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20692.22s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[05:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20704.22s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[05:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20713.22s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20715.22s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[05:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20719.22s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. [[05:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20723.22s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20724.22s)]
*  Well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[05:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20731.22s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20742.22s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[05:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20745.22s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[05:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20748.22s)]
*  You know, Eisner, his strategy for changes this year was for blanking out all of hismmm [[05:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20760.22s)]
*  About the last five. [[05:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20765.54s)]
*  Nice shape. [[05:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20767.54s)]
*  Well,Plankd U. [[05:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20769.34s)]
*  he did a good job. [[05:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20772.34s)]
*  But looking at all the business on his his [[05:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20774.34s)]
*  $1.3 trillion of additional inflationary debt [[05:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20786.36s)]
*  that will drive up food and housing prices even [[05:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20789.2s)]
*  more. [[05:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20791.34s)]
*  In fact, [[05:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20792.34s)]
*  Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than [[05:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20794.16s)]
*  Trudeau. [[05:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20796.440000000002s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin [[05:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20797.68s)]
*  Trudeau. [[05:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20799.98s)]
*  He has phantom numbers. [[05:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20801.0s)]
*  He can't explain. [[05:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20802.18s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even [[05:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20803.68s)]
*  liberal economists. [[05:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20805.68s)]
*  Liberal economists [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20806.64s)]
*  said that Mark Carney's platform is [[05:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20808.82s)]
*  reckless and irresponsible. [[05:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20810.96s)]
*  And Mark [[05:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20811.86s)]
*  Carney arrogantly lashed out at [[05:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20813.28s)]
*  not wanting people to know how much [[05:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20815.420000000002s)]

*  Can you afford that? [[05:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20832.16s)]
*  After the lost [[05:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20833.38s)]
*  liberal decade, to pay for it all, [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20835.08s)]
*  he would have to raise taxes. [[05:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20836.98s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate [[05:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=20838.78s)]

*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform [[06:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21882.64s)]
*  was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[06:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21886.52s)]
*  It was actually, this is not a figure of speech. [[06:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21889.56s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall [[06:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21892.280000000002s)]
*  and they gave it to Trudeau. [[06:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21897.160000000003s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[06:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21898.88s)]
*  oh, we've got a little cough there. [[06:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21904.72s)]
*  We're okay? [[06:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21909.0s)]
*  All right. [[06:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21910.0s)]
*  All right. [[06:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21911.0s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[06:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21912.0s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born [[06:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21919.08s)]
*  and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[06:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21924.08s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[06:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21927.68s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[06:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21930.08s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved [[06:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21933.68s)]
*  that he was going to be okay, so we held him in our arms. [[06:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21936.480000000003s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, [[06:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21938.68s)]
*  Doctor, what did you tell our little infant about? [[06:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21940.88s)]
*  And he said, I don't know. [[06:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21944.480000000003s)]
*  Doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[06:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21946.480000000003s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[06:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21950.88s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[06:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21954.480000000003s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[06:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21965.68s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan [[06:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21969.08s)]
*  because his plan has been carried out over the last five years [[06:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21974.88s)]
*  while he was Trudeau's economic advisor. [[06:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21980.08s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? [[06:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21982.48s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[06:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21984.88s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, [[06:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21987.280000000002s)]
*  Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[06:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21993.08s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, [[06:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=21998.280000000002s)]
*  a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt [[06:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22003.280000000002s)]
*  that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22009.88s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[06:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22013.280000000002s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[06:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22016.48s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[06:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22020.68s)]
*  Yesterday, he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[06:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22024.08s)]
*  The liberal economist, Trevor Toome, said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[06:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22027.68s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, [[06:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22034.68s)]
*  not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring [[06:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22037.68s)]
*  if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[06:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22042.28s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[06:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22046.079999999998s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[06:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22048.88s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[06:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22056.28s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, to pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[06:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22057.48s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[06:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22062.879999999997s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[06:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22067.879999999997s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[06:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22071.28s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[06:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22074.68s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government. [[06:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22082.68s)]
*  The Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[06:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22084.68s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. [[06:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22089.68s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[06:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22096.08s)]
*  That was then. This is now. The past is the past. [[06:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22097.68s)]
*  Forget about it. [[06:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22100.28s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[06:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22101.68s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[06:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22104.68s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[06:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22107.88s)]
*  You know, it would be nice, frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[06:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22110.08s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[06:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22116.68s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[06:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22119.88s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[06:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22122.280000000002s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[06:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22127.68s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[06:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22133.280000000002s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[06:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22137.68s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[06:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22139.08s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[06:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22148.480000000003s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[06:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22155.280000000002s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[06:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22158.88s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[06:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22167.68s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises. [[06:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22173.88s)]
*  Quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country, if young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[06:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22176.88s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[06:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22189.08s)]
*  And this, the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[06:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22194.48s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[06:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22211.18s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the follow the last of us. [[06:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22223.18s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[06:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22231.08s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[06:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22234.78s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[06:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22236.78s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[06:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22238.48s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[06:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22241.18s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[06:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22243.58s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[06:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22248.18s)]
*  He might look different. [[06:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22256.18s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[06:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22257.68s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn. [[06:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22262.48s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[06:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22265.08s)]
*  Yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[06:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22274.38s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[06:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22283.18s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[06:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22285.58s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[06:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22292.18s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[06:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22299.68s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[06:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22302.38s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so that Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[06:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22313.88s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[06:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22320.48s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[06:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22332.48s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[06:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22338.780000000002s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, [[06:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22350.38s)]
*  drug crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[06:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22359.08s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[06:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22364.88s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[06:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22367.18s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 percent respectively. [[06:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22370.68s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[06:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22377.68s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[06:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22381.38s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[06:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22385.28s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[06:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22388.08s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[06:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22394.68s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[06:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22402.58s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[06:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22408.38s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[06:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22411.78s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[06:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22422.28s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[06:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22427.98s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[06:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22435.68s)]
*  Imagine, imagine where we would be today. [[06:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22450.68s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[06:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22453.780000000002s)]
*  Imagine if Conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[06:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22459.379999999997s)]
*  What would have happened? [[06:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22466.68s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[06:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22468.579999999998s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[06:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22470.78s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, [[06:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22474.48s)]
*  which requires judges release offenders under quote the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[06:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22482.48s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a Liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22490.68s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, [[06:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22496.48s)]
*  watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[06:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22502.08s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, [[06:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22507.18s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the Liberal policies in place. [[06:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22512.08s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[06:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22515.58s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them [[06:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22519.88s)]
*  so that together we can reverse the dangerous Liberal crime wave of the last decade [[06:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22524.08s)]
*  and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[06:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22529.08s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[06:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22543.08s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[06:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22545.88s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. It was incredible. [[06:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22550.38s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, [[06:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22554.58s)]
*  leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, [[06:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22560.08s)]
*  they can safely do it and just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[06:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22565.280000000002s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[06:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22570.08s)]
*  This is insanity. But of course it is what life looks like after this lost Liberal decade. [[06:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22577.08s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that Liberals admit in their own reports [[06:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22583.58s)]
*  is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[06:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22590.58s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost Liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[06:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22596.58s)]
*  It is unimaginable. It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[06:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22603.08s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[06:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22607.58s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time, it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[06:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22617.08s)]
*  And what has happened? Homelessness has gone up by 20%, chronic homelessness up 38%. [[06:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22626.08s)]
*  That is the legacy of this Liberal government. The Liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[06:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22632.58s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth Liberal term. [[06:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22639.08s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[06:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22645.58s)]
*  The homeless encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[06:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22651.08s)]
*  Our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[06:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22656.08s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[06:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22663.08s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[06:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22670.08s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl, twisted their spinal cords, twisted from countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[06:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22680.58s)]
*  The other Liberals just say, let it continue. In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed expanding this problem. [[06:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22704.08s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last Liberal decade has brought us. [[06:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22720.58s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out-of-control food prices, which put people under economic strain, and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[06:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22726.58s)]
*  The Liberals had promised to eliminate chronic idinity. They rather abandoned vulnerable people and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[06:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22739.08s)]
*  Camps had now invaded the places where children played, where people, children played on the benches and where families gathered in all security. [[06:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22750.08s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[06:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22763.58s)]
*  The businesses located around the parks have been condemned. [[06:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22773.58s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children pass through the parks to go to school. [[06:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22777.58s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[06:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22786.08s)]
*  This is not compassion. It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the Liberals. [[06:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22800.08s)]
*  And it is the direct result of Liberals' pro-drug agenda, policies that have legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply, and then left the victims with no other options. [[06:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22816.08s)]
*  Nothing for treatment. Nothing for recovery. No attempt to actually get people off drugs. [[06:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22830.58s)]
*  And no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[06:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22836.58s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[06:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22850.58s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[06:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22860.58s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[06:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22870.58s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[06:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22878.58s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. And the people who come out of these encampments into, from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[06:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22887.08s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[06:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22899.08s)]
*  So our plan is clear. First, we will amend the Criminal Code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[06:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22911.58s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. The powers will be right there in the Criminal Code. [[06:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22925.58s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[06:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22934.08s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[06:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22942.08s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. We will treat the problem. [[06:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22950.08s)]
*  We will offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[06:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22958.58s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges, but we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[06:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22965.58s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[06:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=22982.58s)]
*  And for more serious criminals, where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[06:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23013.08s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[06:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23027.08s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[06:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23037.58s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[06:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23053.58s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[06:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23060.08s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[06:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23070.08s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and free public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[06:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23076.58s)]
*  First, we're going to make the police clear the excuses by politicians. [[06:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23098.08s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[06:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23101.08s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also a real support, including mental health services and professional training so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[06:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23112.58s)]
*  Third, if necessary, occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, but we will give the judge the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug position. [[06:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23132.08s)]
*  We will give the judge the option to order a treatment against the drug. [[06:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23150.58s)]
*  And for the more serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we will give the judge more power to order a treatment and common-law tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of a real rehabilitation. [[06:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23155.58s)]
*  That way, we will bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[06:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23178.08s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will replace them with hope for a better future to make changes. [[06:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23188.08s)]
*  We will give the judge the power to order people who live in the camps to pay $300,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[06:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23208.08s)]
*  We will incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[06:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23214.08s)]
*  We will allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[06:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23222.08s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[06:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23230.08s)]
*  We will make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[06:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23236.58s)]
*  Many of the people in these camps didn't start off with that life. [[06:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23239.58s)]
*  What has been happening is because there is absolutely no hope for them. [[06:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23243.58s)]
*  There might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment. [[06:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23247.58s)]
*  We have to reverse the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[06:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23258.08s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[06:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23264.08s)]
*  We need a change. [[06:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23270.08s)]
*  That is why we are here offering that change. [[06:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23272.08s)]
*  We need to change the way we live. [[06:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23274.08s)]
*  We need to change the way we live. [[06:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23276.08s)]
*  We need to change the way we live. [[06:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23278.08s)]
*  We need to change the way we live. [[06:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23280.08s)]
*  We need to change the way we live. [[06:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23282.08s)]
*  That is why we are here offering that change. [[06:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23284.58s)]
*  This is about more than cleaning up our sidewalks. [[06:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23286.58s)]
*  It is about bringing back a good life for Canadians that we used to take for granted. [[06:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23288.58s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, [[06:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23292.58s)]
*  where seniors can walk without fear for a change, where people don't shun our downtowns for a change, [[06:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23300.58s)]
*  where businesses can take down the boards on their windows [[06:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23308.58s)]
*  and open up for serving customers [[06:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23312.420000000002s)]
*  and hiring workers for a change. [[06:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23315.980000000003s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term [[06:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23318.140000000003s)]
*  of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals. [[06:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23320.34s)]
*  With the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, [[06:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23324.2s)]
*  the same liberal advisors, [[06:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23327.0s)]
*  we need a new conservative government [[06:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23328.660000000003s)]
*  that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[06:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23330.86s)]
*  We will strengthen our border [[06:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23335.0s)]
*  to keep out illegal drugs and guns, [[06:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23336.22s)]
*  ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[06:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23338.18s)]
*  We will restore law and order, [[06:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23341.18s)]
*  putting murderers behind bars. [[06:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23342.98s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences [[06:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23345.86s)]
*  for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, [[06:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23348.02s)]
*  they are mass murderers and they will be treated [[06:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23351.82s)]
*  like mass murders when I'm prime minister. [[06:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23353.84s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens [[06:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23356.3s)]
*  and replace them with wonderful treatment centers [[06:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23359.22s)]
*  filled with hope and excitement [[06:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23362.14s)]
*  for people ready to start their lives. [[06:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23364.3s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle [[06:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23366.34s)]
*  of drugs and despair evidence-based treatments [[06:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23369.1s)]
*  so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[06:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23372.420000000002s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change [[06:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23376.82s)]
*  and the chaos for a change, [[06:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23379.06s)]
*  put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[06:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23380.78s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[06:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23384.62s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23388.18s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[06:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23389.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23389.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23392.7s)]
*  We will now go to questions [[06:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23401.100000000002s)]
*  and we will start with a call in question [[06:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23402.78s)]
*  from the phone line. [[06:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23404.74s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[06:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23406.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23407.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23410.3s)]
*  And your first question comes from the line [[06:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23411.14s)]
*  for Renee Pierre-Fontaine from Turner-Le Nord. [[06:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23412.58s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[06:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23415.38s)]
*  Hello. [[06:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23420.5s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Poiliev. [[06:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23431.34s)]
*  In this context, the META is just a part of Canada [[06:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23432.74s)]
*  and blocks access to the content of our media. [[06:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23436.38s)]
*  The political parties have still bought thousands of dollars [[06:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23439.62s)]
*  in advertising on their platform [[06:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23441.9s)]
*  rather than supporting our local media. [[06:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23443.9s)]
*  So what is the position of the conservative party [[06:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23446.78s)]
*  in the C-18 bill [[06:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23449.14s)]
*  that forces American digital companies [[06:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23451.14s)]
*  to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[06:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23452.94s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23457.7s)]
*  A good question. [[06:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23458.78s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, [[06:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23460.739999999998s)]
*  we can't even have access to media articles [[06:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23462.579999999998s)]
*  on Facebook and Instagram. [[06:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23468.059999999998s)]
*  Liberal censorship policies have killed a lot of media, [[06:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23470.86s)]
*  reduced the number of media. [[06:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23476.26s)]
*  Independent media are blocked now to share their stories. [[06:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23478.14s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they know [[06:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23483.14s)]
*  inflation, housing costs, [[06:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23487.62s)]
*  criminal activities in our streets. [[06:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23491.059999999998s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[06:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23492.46s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[06:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23494.899999999998s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth liberal mandate [[06:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23496.66s)]
*  of inflation, real estate inflation, [[06:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23500.98s)]
*  of out-of-control crime. [[06:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23506.58s)]
*  We need that to change. [[06:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23508.38s)]
*  With a new conservative government [[06:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23510.34s)]
*  that will allow the media to share their information [[06:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23513.620000000003s)]
*  on social media, [[06:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23519.14s)]
*  including the issue of accessibility. [[06:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23521.18s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, [[06:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23525.780000000002s)]
*  affordable grocery stores, [[06:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23530.46s)]
*  and safe streets. [[06:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23532.3s)]
*  That's the choice in the elections. [[06:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23533.9s)]
*  After a decade of increasing costs and crime, [[06:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23536.02s)]
*  can we allow a fourth mandate? [[06:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23540.34s)]
*  Or does it need to change [[06:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23542.859999999997s)]
*  to give you a better life in safe communities? [[06:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23545.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23548.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[06:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23549.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23550.94s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[06:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23552.14s)]
*  It was about how, after the lost liberal decade, [[06:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23554.899999999998s)]
*  many media outlets cannot actually share their information [[06:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23559.66s)]
*  on Facebook and Instagram. [[06:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23563.219999999998s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[06:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23565.26s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal. [[06:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23570.699999999997s)]
*  With out-of-control inflation, rising housing costs, [[06:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23571.859999999997s)]
*  crime and chaos in our streets, [[06:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23576.379999999997s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term [[06:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23578.899999999998s)]
*  by shutting out that information. [[06:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23581.019999999997s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget [[06:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23583.019999999997s)]
*  what happened over the last 10 years of Liberal government [[06:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23586.539999999997s)]
*  and forget what will happen in the next 15 years [[06:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23590.98s)]
*  if you read this report that was just leaked out [[06:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23595.1s)]
*  that says that Canadians will be forced to forage [[06:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23600.14s)]
*  on public lands for food [[06:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23603.5s)]
*  if things continue on the current Liberal track. [[06:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23605.94s)]
*  So it's not surprising that Liberals would want [[06:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23609.46s)]
*  to shut out discussion on that. [[06:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23611.98s)]
*  But a fourth Liberal term is not the answer. [[06:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23614.66s)]
*  What we need is a new Conservative government [[06:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23618.18s)]
*  to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23621.059999999998s)]
*  change so there's safety in your streets, [[06:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23624.620000000003s)]
*  change so that we have freedom of expression. [[06:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23626.780000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23628.780000000002s)]

*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[06:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23635.5s)]

*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[06:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23638.18s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[06:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23639.86s)]
*  You had said previously that your government [[06:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23642.300000000003s)]
*  would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[06:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23644.38s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding [[06:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23647.300000000003s)]
*  for local media and local news outlets. [[06:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23650.7s)]
*  That depends so much on grants from the government, [[06:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23653.86s)]
*  subsidies from the government. [[06:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23656.22s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[06:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23657.9s)]
*  I said that in my platform, you can see it there, [[06:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23659.02s)]
*  that we're going to back local independent journalism, [[06:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23661.86s)]
*  including the local journalism initiative. [[06:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23665.46s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media [[06:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23669.62s)]
*  get their fair share of government advertising. [[06:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23672.3s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the Liberal government's [[06:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23676.02s)]
*  favoured media outlets. [[06:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23680.02s)]
*  You know, the Liberals want censorship to silence people [[06:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23682.140000000003s)]
*  about the doubling of housing costs, [[06:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23686.54s)]
*  the insane rise of food prices, [[06:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23688.660000000003s)]
*  the crime and chaos the Liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[06:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23693.18s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth Liberal term. [[06:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23697.460000000003s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the Liberals. [[06:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23701.9s)]
*  It's everybody. It's small businesses, [[06:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23704.34s)]

*  You know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget [[06:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23715.98s)]
*  about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[06:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23720.46s)]
*  And they also want to forget about the next 15 years [[06:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23727.5s)]
*  if the Liberal policies remain in place. [[06:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23730.38s)]
*  We need strong independent media [[06:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23733.38s)]
*  so that Canadians get all the information. [[06:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23737.38s)]
*  We need a change. [[06:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23741.620000000003s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[06:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23742.54s)]
*  It's change. Change, change, change. [[06:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23744.38s)]
*  Change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, [[06:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23747.780000000002s)]

*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[06:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23757.98s)]
*  My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[06:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23760.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, [[06:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23765.98s)]
*  particularly given, you know, some 16-year-old kids in the morgue [[06:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23771.78s)]
*  following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[06:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23775.38s)]
*  You know, I think that's a very important question. [[06:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23778.98s)]
*  I think that's a very important question. [[06:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23781.98s)]
*  Following a shootout with Toronto cops, you know, he pulled first. [[06:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23783.98s)]
*  But what's the kid doing with the gun? [[06:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23789.38s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[06:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23791.98s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[06:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23795.98s)]
*  There do need to be... [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23801.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question. [[06:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23803.18s)]
*  And the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade [[06:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23804.98s)]
*  of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[06:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23811.98s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[06:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23818.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[06:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23826.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[06:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23830.98s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[06:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23836.98s)]
*  25% of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[06:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23839.98s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[06:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23843.98s)]
*  And I think if we elect the liberals to a fourth liberal term, [[06:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23846.98s)]
*  it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[06:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23850.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[06:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23852.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[06:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23858.98s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, [[06:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23860.98s)]
*  stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[06:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23865.98s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[06:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23871.98s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[06:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23877.98s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[06:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23883.98s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[06:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23887.98s)]
*  Because we're giving young people hope. [[06:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23888.98s)]
*  A hope that they're going to have a better future. [[06:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23890.98s)]
*  A real hope for a change. [[06:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23894.98s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime, [[06:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23897.98s)]
*  knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[06:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23905.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel. [[06:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23908.98s)]
*  A business that they can start. [[06:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23910.98s)]
*  A community where they will thrive and succeed. [[06:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23913.98s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[06:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23917.98s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[06:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23923.98s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[06:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23925.98s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[06:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23927.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23928.98s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[06:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23929.98s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. [[06:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23937.98s)]
*  Tria Izri, Global News. [[06:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23938.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[06:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23940.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[06:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23946.98s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[06:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23949.98s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, [[06:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23955.98s)]
*  by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[06:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23961.98s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, [[06:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23966.98s)]
*  given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[06:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23970.98s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth [[06:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23973.98s)]
*  and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies [[06:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23977.98s)]
*  that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[06:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23982.98s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[06:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23986.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty, [[06:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23988.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned [[06:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23993.98s)]
*  and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter-trillion dollars [[06:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=23998.98s)]
*  of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[06:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24005.98s)]
*  Now, you ask me in a period of economic weakness, [[06:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24010.98s)]
*  after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, [[06:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24014.98s)]
*  whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[06:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24018.98s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[06:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24023.98s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[06:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24028.98s)]
*  Of course it's... [[06:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24031.98s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[06:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24038.98s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[06:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24043.98s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[06:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24046.98s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills [[06:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24049.98s)]
*  and we need to get Stelco and DeFasco elsewhere, Algoma and Everest [[06:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24054.98s)]
*  to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[06:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24060.98s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[06:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24063.98s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law, C-69, [[06:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24066.98s)]
*  getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones [[06:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24073.98s)]
*  that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[06:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24078.98s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks [[06:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24083.98s)]
*  that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[06:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24087.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24092.98s)]
*  Thank you everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[06:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24093.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[06:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24095.98s)]
*  In French? [[06:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24098.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. Thank you. [[06:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24099.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24113.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24143.98s)]
*  Thank you, buddy. [[06:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24174.98s)]
*  Amazing. [[06:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24176.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24181.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[06:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24182.98s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[06:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24188.98s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word. [[06:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24191.98s)]
*  Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. [[06:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24197.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. Change that you are safe on your streets. [[06:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24203.98s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. Change to put Canada first. [[06:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24213.98s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, [[06:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24219.98s)]
*  for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[06:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24225.98s)]
*  The election is coming and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[06:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24228.98s)]
*  Change. Change for affordable food and housing. Change for a safe life. Change for real. [[06:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24237.98s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[06:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24249.98s)]
*  After 10 long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, [[06:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24251.98s)]
*  the immigration system out of control, it has to change and it is only the Conservatives that will change things. [[06:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24261.98s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[06:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24269.98s)]
*  Ned Currick in Hamilton East, Zony Creek. [[06:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24273.98s)]
*  Dan Muse, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Grant North. [[06:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24281.98s)]
*  Erika Alexander. Give her a round of applause. [[06:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24294.98s)]
*  She of course is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, [[06:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24302.98s)]
*  who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, [[06:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24306.98s)]
*  a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, [[06:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24311.98s)]
*  and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[06:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24317.98s)]
*  Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzor. Give them all a round of applause. [[06:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24327.98s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[06:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24337.98s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, [[06:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24343.98s)]
*  but it's official, the Toronto Police Union is ready for change [[06:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24349.98s)]
*  and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[06:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24355.98s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, [[06:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24366.98s)]
*  the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[06:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24373.98s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[06:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24380.98s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[06:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24385.98s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[06:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24393.98s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet [[06:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24396.98s)]
*  and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[06:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24400.98s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, [[06:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24403.98s)]
*  and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24413.98s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[06:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24423.98s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[06:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24438.98s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[06:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24441.98s)]
*  When they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[06:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24447.98s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[06:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24454.98s)]
*  I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out, [[06:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24473.98s)]
*  and little baby Cruz, and he wasn't crying. [[06:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24479.98s)]
*  Of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[06:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24482.98s)]
*  Then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[06:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24484.98s)]
*  All of a sudden a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay, [[06:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24487.98s)]
*  so we held him in our arms. [[06:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24491.98s)]
*  Afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, [[06:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24493.98s)]
*  Doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[06:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24495.98s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[06:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24499.98s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[06:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24503.98s)]
*  They took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau, [[06:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24514.98s)]
*  and then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan [[06:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24517.98s)]
*  because his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[06:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24523.98s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic advisor, so why would he presume to change anything? [[06:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24528.98s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[06:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24533.98s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, [[06:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24535.98s)]
*  Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[06:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24541.98s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, [[06:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24546.98s)]
*  a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt [[06:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24551.98s)]
*  that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[06:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24558.98s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[06:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24561.98s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[06:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24565.98s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[06:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24569.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[06:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24572.98s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible, [[06:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24576.98s)]
*  and Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, [[06:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24583.98s)]
*  not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring [[06:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24586.98s)]
*  if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[06:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24590.98s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[06:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24594.98s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[06:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24597.98s)]
*  Can you afford that after the lost liberal decade? [[06:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24604.98s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[06:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24607.98s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[06:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24610.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[06:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24615.98s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[06:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24619.98s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[06:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24622.98s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week, [[06:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24630.98s)]
*  but the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[06:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24632.98s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is, [[06:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24637.98s)]
*  forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[06:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24641.98s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[06:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24644.98s)]
*  That was then, this is now, the past is the past. [[06:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24646.98s)]
*  Forget about it. [[06:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24648.98s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[06:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24650.98s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[06:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24653.98s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[06:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24656.98s)]
*  And, you know, it would be nice, frankly, this is a draw-dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[06:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24658.98s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[06:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24665.98s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[06:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24668.98s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24671.98s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[06:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24676.98s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[06:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24681.98s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[06:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24686.98s)]
*  I say that many times just so, because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be, [[06:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24687.98s)]
*  you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[06:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24693.98s)]
*  The report says that in 2040, more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries on housing. [[06:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24696.98s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[06:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24703.98s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, [[06:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24707.98s)]
*  a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[06:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24712.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[06:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24716.98s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers, forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[06:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24722.98s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[06:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24730.98s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[06:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24737.98s)]
*  And this, the most startling comment of all, that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, [[06:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24742.98s)]
*  might have to start hunt, fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[06:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24752.98s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[06:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24758.98s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television, television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[06:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24771.98s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[06:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24779.98s)]
*  It's not for 100 years from now. [[06:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24783.98s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[06:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24785.98s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[06:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24787.98s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[06:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24789.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[06:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24792.98s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[06:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24795.98s)]
*  He might look different. [[06:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24804.98s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[06:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24806.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn. [[06:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24810.98s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government, predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[06:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24813.98s)]
*  It's funny, yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[06:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24822.98s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[06:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24831.98s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[06:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24834.98s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[06:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24840.98s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[06:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24848.98s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so that Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[06:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24850.98s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[06:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24868.98s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[06:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24870.98s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[06:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24886.98s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[06:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24898.98s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[06:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24913.98s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[06:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24915.98s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 percent respectively. [[06:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24919.98s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[06:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24926.98s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[06:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24930.98s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[06:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24934.98s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[06:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24936.98s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[06:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24943.98s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[06:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24951.98s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[06:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24957.98s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[06:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24960.98s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[06:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24971.98s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[06:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24976.98s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[06:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24984.98s)]
*  Imagine how imagine what where we would be today. [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=24999.98s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[06:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25002.98s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[06:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25007.98s)]
*  What would have happened? [[06:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25015.98s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[06:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25017.98s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[06:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25019.98s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[06:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25022.98s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[06:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25039.98s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[06:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25044.98s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[06:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25055.98s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[06:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25064.98s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[06:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25068.98s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[06:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25091.98s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[06:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25094.98s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[06:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25098.98s)]
*  It was incredible. [[06:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25101.98s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[06:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25103.98s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[06:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25115.98s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[06:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25118.98s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you. [[06:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25121.98s)]
*  This is insanity. [[06:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25126.98s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[06:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25127.98s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[06:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25132.98s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[06:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25145.98s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[06:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25151.98s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[06:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25153.98s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[06:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25156.98s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time, it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[06:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25165.98s)]
*  And what has happened? [[06:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25174.98s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[06:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25176.98s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[06:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25178.98s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[06:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25181.98s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[06:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25184.98s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[06:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25187.98s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[06:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25189.98s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[06:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25194.98s)]
*  The homeless encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[06:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25199.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[07:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25204.98s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[07:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25211.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[07:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25214.98s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[07:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25218.98s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl. [[07:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25228.98s)]
*  Twisted, their spinal cords twisted for countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[07:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25235.98s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[07:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25251.98s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed expanding this problem. [[07:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25254.98s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[07:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25269.98s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[07:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25275.98s)]
*  The liberals had promised to eliminate chronic addiction. [[07:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25287.98s)]
*  They rather abandoned vulnerable people and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[07:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25291.98s)]
*  The camps were now invading the places where children played before and where families gathered in all safety. [[07:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25298.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas where drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime are at their peak. [[07:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25311.98s)]
*  The businesses around the parks have been condemned. [[07:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25322.98s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children walk through the parks to go to school. [[07:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25326.98s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, sisters, neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[07:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25333.98s)]
*  It's not compassion. [[07:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25347.98s)]
*  It's cruelty that people live after ten long years of the liberals. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25350.98s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[07:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25356.98s)]
*  Letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[07:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25357.98s)]
*  It is chaos. [[07:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25362.98s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals' pro-drug agenda. [[07:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25364.98s)]
*  Policies that have legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply. [[07:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25368.98s)]
*  And then left the victims with no other options. [[07:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25375.98s)]
*  Nothing for treatment. [[07:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25378.98s)]
*  Nothing for recovery. [[07:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25380.98s)]
*  No attempt to actually get people off drugs. [[07:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25382.98s)]
*  And no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[07:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25384.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[07:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25398.98s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[07:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25404.98s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[07:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25417.98s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[07:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25422.98s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[07:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25429.98s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[07:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25437.98s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into, from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[07:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25440.98s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[07:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25449.98s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[07:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25453.98s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[07:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25461.98s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[07:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25463.98s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[07:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25476.98s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[07:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25481.98s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[07:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25484.98s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[07:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25490.98s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[07:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25495.98s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[07:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25499.98s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[07:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25506.98s)]
*  We'll go for mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[07:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25508.98s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges. [[07:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25515.98s)]
*  But we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places. [[07:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25519.98s)]
*  We will give them a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[07:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25527.98s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. [[07:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25532.98s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[07:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25536.98s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, [[07:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25553.98s)]
*  we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[07:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25570.98s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[07:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25575.98s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, [[07:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25585.98s)]
*  then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[07:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25595.98s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[07:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25602.98s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[07:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25605.98s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. [[07:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25608.98s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[07:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25613.98s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[07:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25618.98s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. [[07:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25624.98s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger [[07:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25626.98s)]
*  and release public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary shelters and tents. [[07:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25638.98s)]
*  We're going to make the police stop apologizing to politicians. [[07:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25646.98s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[07:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25649.98s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also real support, particularly for mental health services and professional training, [[07:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25661.98s)]
*  so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[07:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25671.98s)]
*  Third, if needed, occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, [[07:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25680.98s)]
*  but we're going to give the judge the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug and the sites. [[07:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25686.98s)]
*  We're going to give the judge the option to order them to do drug treatment. [[07:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25698.98s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, [[07:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25704.98s)]
*  we're going to give the judge the power to order them to do treatment and common-sense testing inside prisons [[07:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25710.98s)]
*  to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[07:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25718.98s)]
*  That way, we're going to bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[07:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25725.98s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will replace them with hope for a better future to make changes. [[07:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25736.98s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[07:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25744.98s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[07:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25748.98s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land, and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[07:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25760.98s)]
*  Our plan will allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[07:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25769.98s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[07:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25778.98s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[07:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25785.98s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[07:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25788.98s)]
*  But what has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[07:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25792.98s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment. [[07:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25796.98s)]
*  Never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[07:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25805.98s)]
*  So what happens then? [[07:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25808.98s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[07:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25809.98s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[07:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25814.98s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[07:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25815.98s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[07:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25817.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[07:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25825.98s)]
*  We need a change. [[07:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25831.98s)]
*  And that's why we're here offering that change. [[07:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25833.98s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[07:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25836.98s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[07:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25838.98s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, [[07:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25843.98s)]
*  where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[07:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25852.98s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[07:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25866.98s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[07:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25876.98s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[07:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25882.98s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[07:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25888.98s)]
*  We're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again. [[07:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25893.98s)]
*  They are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[07:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25899.98s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[07:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25904.98s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[07:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25914.98s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[07:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25924.98s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[07:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25928.98s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[07:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25933.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25936.98s)]
*  Let's sing it home. [[07:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25937.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25938.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25941.98s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[07:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25949.98s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[07:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25954.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25955.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25959.98s)]
*  And your first question comes from the line for Nathia Fontaine from Toronto. [[07:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25960.98s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[07:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25964.98s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Poliev. [[07:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25979.98s)]
*  In this context, the META is just supporting tax in Canada and blocking access to the content of our media. [[07:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25980.98s)]
*  Political parties have still bought thousands of dollars in advertising on their platforms rather than supporting our local media. [[07:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25987.98s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives in the face of the C-18 law that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[07:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=25994.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26006.98s)]
*  A good question. [[07:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26007.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[07:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26008.98s)]
*  Liberal censor policies have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. [[07:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26019.98s)]
*  Independent media are now blocked from sharing their history. [[07:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26026.98s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they've inflated inflation, housing costs, criminalization of the rich. [[07:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26031.98s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[07:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26040.98s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[07:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26042.98s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth liberal mandate for inflation, real estate inflation, and out of control crime. [[07:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26044.98s)]
*  We need that to change. [[07:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26056.98s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[07:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26058.98s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, and safe streets. [[07:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26073.98s)]
*  That's the choice in the elections. [[07:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26082.98s)]
*  After a decade of high costs and crime, can we allow a fourth mandate or does it need to change to give you a better life in the safe communities? [[07:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26084.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26097.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[07:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26098.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26099.98s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[07:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26100.98s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[07:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26103.98s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[07:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26113.98s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[07:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26119.98s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[07:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26127.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal system. [[07:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26131.98s)]
*  That's the whole track. [[07:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26157.98s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[07:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26158.98s)]
*  But at a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[07:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26163.98s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change to their safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[07:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26167.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26177.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26179.98s)]
*  Next question. [[07:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26180.98s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[07:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26184.98s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[07:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26186.98s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[07:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26188.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[07:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26193.98s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26203.98s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local, the local media. [[07:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26205.98s)]
*  Including the local, the local journalism initiative. [[07:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26214.98s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[07:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26218.98s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favored media outlets. [[07:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26224.98s)]
*  And, you know, the liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos. [[07:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26230.98s)]
*  That's what the liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[07:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26243.98s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[07:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26246.98s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[07:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26250.98s)]
*  It's everybody. [[07:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26253.98s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[07:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26254.98s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years. [[07:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26263.98s)]
*  By limiting debate and distracting. [[07:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26272.98s)]
*  And we're not, they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the liberal policies remain in place. [[07:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26276.98s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[07:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26282.98s)]
*  We need a change. [[07:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26290.98s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[07:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26291.98s)]
*  It's change. [[07:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26293.98s)]
*  Change, change, change. [[07:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26294.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food. [[07:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26296.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford homes. [[07:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26298.98s)]
*  Change so that you are safe in your street. [[07:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26300.98s)]
*  This election is about change. [[07:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26302.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26304.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26305.98s)]
*  Next question. [[07:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26306.98s)]
*  Hi. [[07:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26307.98s)]
*  Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[07:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26315.98s)]
*  My question is the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[07:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26317.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[07:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26322.98s)]
*  You know, he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun? [[07:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26334.98s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[07:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26338.98s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[07:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26342.98s)]
*  There do need to be. [[07:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26349.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[07:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26351.98s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[07:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26367.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[07:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26375.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[07:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26379.98s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[07:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26384.98s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[07:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26387.98s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[07:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26392.98s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[07:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26396.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[07:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26401.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[07:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26407.98s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[07:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26409.98s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[07:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26420.98s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[07:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26426.98s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[07:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26432.98s)]
*  Well, why is it? Because we're giving young people hope, a hope that they're going to have a better future. [[07:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26436.98s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[07:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26443.98s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime, knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[07:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26451.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[07:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26458.98s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[07:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26472.98s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[07:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26475.98s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[07:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26477.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26478.98s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[07:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26483.98s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. Triya Izri, Global News. [[07:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26487.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[07:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26490.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[07:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26496.98s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[07:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26499.98s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[07:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26505.98s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[07:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26516.98s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[07:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26523.98s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[07:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26536.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[07:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26538.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[07:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26543.98s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth. [[07:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26560.98s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[07:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26573.98s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[07:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26578.98s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[07:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26588.98s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[07:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26592.98s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[07:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26595.98s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everas to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[07:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26598.98s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[07:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26612.98s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[07:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26614.98s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[07:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26632.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26641.98s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[07:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26642.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[07:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26643.98s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[07:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26645.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26650.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26651.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26681.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26711.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[07:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26732.98s)]
*  It's great to be here in the hammer. [[07:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26738.98s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change, change, change, change, change. [[07:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26740.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[07:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26757.98s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[07:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26760.98s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[07:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26763.98s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[07:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26767.98s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[07:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26769.98s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[07:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26797.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26823.98s)]

*  Lincoln Alexander who is the first black member of parliament, first black minister in Canadian history. [[07:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26854.98s)]
*  A great conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story. [[07:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26861.98s)]
*  And we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[07:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26867.98s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. [[07:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26871.98s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[07:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26881.98s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[07:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26888.98s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. [[07:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26893.98s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[07:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26901.98s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people. [[07:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26919.98s)]
*  The police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[07:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26922.98s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[07:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26929.98s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[07:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26933.98s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[07:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26941.98s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[07:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26945.98s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[07:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26952.98s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[07:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26970.98s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[07:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26987.98s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[07:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26990.98s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[07:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=26996.98s)]
*  Oh, we've got a little cough there. [[07:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27003.98s)]
*  We're okay? All right. [[07:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27007.98s)]
*  All right. [[07:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27009.98s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in our Carney's platform. [[07:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27010.98s)]
*  You know, you know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[07:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27022.98s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[07:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27031.98s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[07:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27033.98s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[07:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27037.98s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. [[07:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27041.98s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[07:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27042.98s)]
*  And he said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[07:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27049.98s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[07:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27060.98s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[07:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27063.98s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[07:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27066.98s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. [[07:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27078.98s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? [[07:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27080.98s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[07:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27083.98s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[07:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27085.98s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[07:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27096.98s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[07:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27110.98s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[07:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27114.98s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[07:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27118.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[07:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27121.98s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[07:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27125.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[07:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27132.98s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[07:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27143.98s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[07:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27146.98s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[07:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27153.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade? [[07:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27154.98s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[07:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27157.98s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[07:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27160.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[07:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27165.98s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[07:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27168.98s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[07:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27172.98s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[07:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27180.98s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[07:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27187.98s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[07:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27194.98s)]
*  That was then. [[07:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27195.98s)]
*  This is now. [[07:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27196.98s)]
*  The past is the past. [[07:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27197.98s)]
*  Forget about it. [[07:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27198.98s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[07:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27199.98s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[07:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27202.98s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[07:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27205.98s)]
*  You know, it'd be nice. [[07:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27207.98s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[07:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27209.98s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[07:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27214.98s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[07:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27217.98s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[07:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27220.98s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[07:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27225.98s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[07:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27230.98s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[07:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27235.98s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[07:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27237.98s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[07:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27246.98s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[07:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27253.98s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[07:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27256.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[07:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27265.98s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[07:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27271.98s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[07:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27279.98s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[07:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27286.98s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[07:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27292.98s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[07:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27308.98s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[07:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27315.98s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[07:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27320.98s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[07:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27328.98s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[07:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27332.98s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[07:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27334.98s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[07:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27336.98s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[07:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27338.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[07:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27341.98s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[07:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27344.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[07:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27347.98s)]
*  They might he might look different. [[07:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27353.98s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[07:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27355.98s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing. [[07:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27360.98s)]
*  Shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[07:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27365.98s)]
*  It's funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[07:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27371.98s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[07:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27380.98s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[07:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27383.98s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become. [[07:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27389.98s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government. [[07:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27393.98s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[07:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27396.98s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[07:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27399.98s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[07:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27417.98s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[07:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27419.98s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[07:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27425.98s)]
*  The crime of the last liberal decade is a symbol of the loss of the right to live. [[07:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27436.98s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them. [[07:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27443.98s)]
*  The violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug, crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[07:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27446.98s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[07:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27458.98s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 40 percent. [[07:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27460.98s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[07:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27468.98s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[07:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27471.98s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[07:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27475.98s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[07:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27478.98s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed. [[07:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27484.98s)]
*  And hit her instead. [[07:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27490.98s)]

*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[07:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27499.98s)]

*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often seen as a victim of a crime. [[07:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27522.98s)]

*  last 10 years the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75 which requires [[07:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27573.38s)]

*  this lost liberal decade. One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit [[07:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27680.74s)]

*  In Ontario alone after the lost liberal decade there are 1400 homeless encampments. It is [[07:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27695.460000000003s)]
*  unimaginable. It's like something out of the great depression. In Toronto the number of homeless [[07:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27702.74s)]
*  encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. Homelessness is up [[07:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27708.420000000002s)]
*  20% since 2018. Roughly the time it's interesting Mark Carney became the economic advisor in 2020 [[07:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27717.86s)]
*  and what has happened homelessness has gone up by 20% chronic homelessness up 38%. That is the [[07:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27725.54s)]
*  legacy of this liberal government. The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness instead [[07:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27732.58s)]
*  it went through the roof and now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a [[07:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27738.82s)]
*  fourth liberal term. Instead they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and [[07:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27743.460000000003s)]
*  back alleys. Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[07:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27748.74s)]
*  Our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and [[07:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27754.98s)]
*  crime. Businesses around parks have been boarded up. Parents are afraid to let their kids cut [[07:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27760.82s)]
*  through parks on their way to school and for those trapped in these camps our brothers, our sisters, [[07:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27766.58s)]

*  their bodies and their minds and the liberals just say let it continue. In fact their policy [[07:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27799.3s)]
*  has been to supply even more drugs more opioids keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus [[07:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27806.34s)]
*  of bureaucracy and interest groups employed expanding this problem. These these homeless [[07:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27814.42s)]
*  encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. Doubling housing [[07:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27821.219999999998s)]
*  costs out of control food prices which put people under economic strain and of course [[07:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27827.14s)]
*  rampant liberalization of drugs and crime which allow the chaos to expand. [[07:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27833.14s)]
*  Let me be clear letting these tent cities spread is not compassion it is chaos and it is the direct [[07:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27887.14s)]
*  result of liberals pro-drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs pumped toxic [[07:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27915.94s)]
*  narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no [[07:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27922.02s)]
*  other options. No nothing for treatment nothing for recovery no attempt to actually get people [[07:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27927.539999999997s)]
*  off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark by Mark Carney who wants to [[07:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27934.1s)]
*  continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. A new [[07:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27942.42s)]
*  conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. Public spaces [[07:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27949.14s)]
*  public spaces must be safe for everyone we will take back our streets and restore [[07:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27965.62s)]
*  order in our communities and we will give people that that are currently trapped in these awful [[07:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27970.98s)]
*  circumstances a pathway to a better life a life with a home with nutritious food physical exercise [[07:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27976.420000000002s)]

*  who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows they will come into the light and [[07:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=27991.38s)]

*  and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. So our plan is clear [[07:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28007.22s)]
*  first we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove [[07:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28014.1s)]
*  individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently [[07:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28018.5s)]
*  blocked by tents and temporary shelters no more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have [[07:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28024.1s)]
*  the powers the powers will be right there in the criminal code no more paralysis from politically [[07:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28031.059999999998s)]
*  correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action second we will provide addiction [[07:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28037.14s)]
*  treatment to 50 000 Canadians we will return a true housing first model get people into a home [[07:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28042.98s)]

*  we will get them into addiction treat treatment we will treat the the problem we'll offer mental [[07:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28053.86s)]
*  health supports job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the [[07:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28058.74s)]
*  housing they need third where appropriate the occupants will face criminal charges but but we [[07:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28063.54s)]
*  will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegal illegally occupying these [[07:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28071.14s)]
*  public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment so we're not [[07:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28076.100000000002s)]

*  a public space then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment [[07:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28089.38s)]
*  that will get them off the poisons that condemn them to that homelessness in the first place and [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28097.780000000002s)]
*  and for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime but where their crime [[07:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28105.54s)]
*  requires they do jail time we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison [[07:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28118.66s)]
*  sentence and there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes [[07:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28125.38s)]

*  change. It's time to stop the crime for a change end the chaos for a change put law-abiding Canadians [[07:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28474.74s)]
*  first for a change that is how we bring hope for a change. Thank you very much let's bring it home. [[07:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28481.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28488.58s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call-in question from the phone line. [[07:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28499.78s)]
*  Thank you guys thank you. [[07:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28505.22s)]
*  Thank you and your first question sounds in the life of Renee Pierre-Fontaine [[07:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28509.06s)]
*  from turn on lenoir. [[07:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28512.98s)]
*  Um [[07:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28523.7s)]
*  to support our local media. [[07:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28542.98s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives [[07:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28544.98s)]
*  in the C-18 Act [[07:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28547.98s)]
*  that forces American digital companies [[07:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28549.98s)]
*  to indemnify Canadian media [[07:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28551.98s)]
*  to share their content? [[07:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28553.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28555.98s)]
*  A good question. [[07:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28557.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, [[07:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28559.98s)]
*  we can't even have access [[07:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28561.98s)]
*  to the media articles [[07:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28563.98s)]
*  on Facebook and Instagram. [[07:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28566.98s)]
*  The political system that censors [[07:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28569.98s)]
*  the Liberals has killed [[07:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28571.98s)]
*  a lot of media, [[07:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28573.98s)]
*  reduced the number of media. [[07:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28575.98s)]
*  Independent media are blocked [[07:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28577.98s)]
*  from sharing their stories. [[07:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28579.98s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want [[07:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28581.98s)]
*  after knowing how to inflate inflation, [[07:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28584.98s)]
*  the cost of housing, [[07:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28587.98s)]
*  the crime in our streets. [[07:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28589.98s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[07:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28591.98s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[07:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28593.98s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth liberal mandate [[07:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28595.98s)]
*  to free inflation, [[07:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28598.98s)]
*  real estate inflation, [[07:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28600.98s)]
*  and out of control crime. [[07:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28603.98s)]
*  We need that to change. [[07:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28606.98s)]
*  With a new Conservative government [[07:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28608.98s)]
*  that will allow the media [[07:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28611.98s)]
*  to share their information [[07:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28614.98s)]
*  on social media, [[07:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28617.98s)]
*  including the issue of accessibility. [[07:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28619.98s)]
*  We will make changes [[07:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28623.98s)]
*  with affordable houses, [[07:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28626.98s)]
*  affordable grocery stores, [[07:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28628.98s)]
*  and safe streets. [[07:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28630.98s)]
*  That's the choice in the elections. [[07:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28632.98s)]
*  After a liberal decade, [[07:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28634.98s)]
*  the cost and crime are increasing. [[07:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28636.98s)]
*  Can we allow a fourth mandate? [[07:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28638.98s)]
*  Or does it need to change [[07:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28640.98s)]
*  to give you a nice, affordable life [[07:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28642.98s)]
*  in safe communities? [[07:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28644.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28646.98s)]
*  In English, please. [[07:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28648.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28650.98s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[07:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28652.98s)]
*  I think it's important to note [[07:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28654.98s)]
*  how after the lost liberal decade, [[07:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28656.98s)]
*  many media outlets cannot actually [[07:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28658.98s)]
*  share their information on Facebook [[07:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28660.98s)]
*  and Instagram. [[07:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28662.98s)]
*  This has really attacked [[07:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28664.98s)]
*  our local independent media. [[07:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28666.98s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal [[07:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28668.98s)]
*  with out of control inflation, [[07:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28670.98s)]
*  rising housing costs, [[07:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28672.98s)]
*  crime and chaos in our streets. [[07:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28674.98s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term [[07:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28676.98s)]
*  by shutting out that information. [[07:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28679.98s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on [[07:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28681.98s)]
*  making you forget what happened [[07:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28683.98s)]
*  over the last 10 years [[07:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28685.98s)]
*  of liberal government [[07:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28687.98s)]
*  and forget what will happen [[07:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28689.98s)]
*  in the next 15 years [[07:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28691.98s)]
*  if you read this report [[07:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28693.98s)]
*  that was just leaked out [[07:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28695.98s)]
*  that says that Canadians [[07:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28697.98s)]
*  will be forced to forage [[07:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28699.98s)]
*  on public lands for food [[07:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28701.98s)]
*  if things continue [[07:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28703.98s)]
*  on the current liberal track. [[07:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28705.98s)]
*  So it's not surprising that [[07:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28707.98s)]
*  liberals would want to shut out [[07:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28709.98s)]
*  that information on that. [[07:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28711.98s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term [[07:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28713.98s)]
*  is not the answer. [[07:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28715.98s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative [[07:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28717.98s)]
*  government to bring change. [[07:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28719.98s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and homes. [[07:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28721.98s)]
*  Change so there's safety in your streets. [[07:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28723.98s)]
*  Change so that we have freedom of expression. [[07:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28725.98s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28727.98s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[07:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28729.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28731.98s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28733.98s)]
*  Sorry, I can't. [[07:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28735.98s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[07:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28737.98s)]
*  I have a curious question. [[07:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28739.98s)]
*  You had said previously that your government [[07:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28741.98s)]
*  would cut funding for certain broadcasters [[07:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28743.98s)]
*  and news outlets. [[07:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28745.98s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding [[07:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28747.98s)]
*  for local media [[07:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28749.98s)]
*  and local news outlets that depend so much [[07:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28751.98s)]
*  on grants from the government, [[07:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28753.98s)]
*  subsidies from the government. [[07:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28755.98s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[07:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28757.98s)]
*  I said in my platform, you can see it there [[07:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28759.98s)]
*  that we're going to back [[07:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28761.98s)]
*  local independent journalism [[07:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28763.98s)]
*  including the local [[07:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28765.98s)]
*  news outlets. [[07:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28767.98s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media [[07:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28769.98s)]
*  get their fair share of government [[07:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28771.98s)]
*  advertising. [[07:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28773.98s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to [[07:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28775.98s)]
*  the liberal government's favoured [[07:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28777.98s)]
*  media outlets. [[07:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28779.98s)]
*  The liberals want [[07:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28781.98s)]
*  censorship to silence [[07:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28783.98s)]
*  people about the doubling of housing costs, [[07:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28785.98s)]
*  the insane [[07:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28787.98s)]
*  rise of food prices, [[07:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28789.98s)]
*  the crime and chaos [[07:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28791.98s)]
*  the liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[07:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28793.98s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford [[07:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28795.98s)]
*  a fourth liberal term. [[07:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28797.98s)]
*  It's not just local media [[07:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28799.98s)]
*  that are suffering under the liberals. It's everybody. [[08:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28801.98s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, [[08:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28803.98s)]
*  it's the steel workers [[08:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28805.98s)]
*  here in Hamilton that [[08:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28807.98s)]
*  Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[08:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28809.98s)]
*  But we're not going to [[08:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28811.98s)]
*  let them... You know, their entire strategy [[08:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28813.98s)]
*  is to make Canadians [[08:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28815.98s)]
*  forget about the last [[08:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28817.98s)]
*  ten years [[08:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28819.98s)]
*  by limiting [[08:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28821.98s)]
*  debate and distracting. [[08:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28823.98s)]
*  And they also want you to forget [[08:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28825.98s)]
*  about the next fifteen years if these [[08:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28827.98s)]
*  if the liberal policies remain in place. [[08:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28829.98s)]
*  We need strong [[08:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28831.98s)]
*  independent media [[08:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28833.98s)]
*  so that Canadians [[08:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28835.98s)]
*  get all the information. [[08:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28837.98s)]
*  We need to change. This election [[08:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28839.98s)]
*  really comes down to one word. It's change. [[08:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28841.98s)]
*  Change, change, [[08:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28843.98s)]

*  Hi, Brad [[08:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28863.98s)]
*  Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[08:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28865.98s)]
*  My question is [[08:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28867.98s)]
*  the law and order has been a cornerstone [[08:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28869.98s)]
*  of your platform. [[08:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28871.98s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of [[08:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28873.98s)]
*  is about [[08:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28875.98s)]
*  youthful offenders, particularly given [[08:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28877.98s)]
*  some 16 year old kids in the morgue [[08:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28879.98s)]
*  following a shootout with Toronto [[08:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28881.98s)]
*  cops. [[08:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28883.98s)]
*  You know, he pulled first [[08:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28885.98s)]
*  but what's the kid doing with the [[08:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28887.98s)]
*  gun? You know, if he survived [[08:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28889.98s)]
*  was he only going to do 18 [[08:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28891.98s)]
*  months? [[08:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28893.98s)]
*  What do you think should be done [[08:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28895.98s)]
*  with the young offender [[08:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28897.98s)]
*  issue? [[08:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28899.98s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question [[08:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28901.98s)]
*  and the story that you shared [[08:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28903.98s)]
*  is another tragic [[08:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28905.98s)]
*  result of the lost liberal decade [[08:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28907.98s)]
*  of [[08:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28909.98s)]
*  lax criminal [[08:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28911.98s)]
*  justice laws, weak [[08:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28913.98s)]
*  borders and drugs on our streets. [[08:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28915.98s)]
*  You know, our kids are now [[08:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28917.98s)]
*  more vulnerable [[08:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28919.98s)]
*  to gang [[08:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28921.98s)]
*  recruitment than ever before. [[08:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28923.98s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out [[08:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28925.98s)]
*  and exhausted. [[08:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28927.98s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere [[08:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28929.98s)]
*  in our streets that have come in through [[08:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28931.98s)]
*  the poorest borders [[08:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28933.98s)]
*  and there's more poverty. [[08:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28935.98s)]
*  25% of our people [[08:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28937.98s)]
*  live in poverty after the lost liberal [[08:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28939.98s)]
*  decade. So our [[08:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28941.98s)]
*  youth have never been so vulnerable. [[08:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28943.98s)]
*  And I think [[08:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28945.98s)]
*  if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term [[08:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28947.98s)]
*  it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[08:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28949.98s)]
*  More crime, more danger, [[08:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28951.98s)]
*  more inflation, [[08:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28953.98s)]
*  more malnutrition. [[08:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28955.98s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal [[08:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28957.98s)]
*  term. We need a change. A change [[08:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28959.98s)]
*  to lock up the criminals, secure [[08:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28961.98s)]
*  the borders, stop the drugs, [[08:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28963.98s)]
*  guns and stolen cars from going [[08:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28965.98s)]
*  through our ports and across [[08:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28967.98s)]
*  our frontiers. We need [[08:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28969.98s)]
*  to give young people [[08:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28971.98s)]
*  a sense of hope and opportunity [[08:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28973.98s)]
*  again. I think [[08:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28975.98s)]
*  one of the things I've noticed about my [[08:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28977.98s)]
*  campaign is how many young [[08:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28979.98s)]
*  people are involved. And [[08:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28981.98s)]
*  it wasn't always the case [[08:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28983.98s)]
*  for conservatives. Well, why is it? Because [[08:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28985.98s)]
*  we're giving young people hope. [[08:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28987.98s)]
*  Hope that they're going to have a better future. [[08:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28989.98s)]
*  Real hope [[08:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28991.98s)]
*  for a change. [[08:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28993.98s)]
*  I want every young person [[08:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=28999.98s)]
*  in this country to reject a life [[08:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29001.98s)]
*  of crime knowing that there's something [[08:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29003.98s)]
*  so much better we have in store for them. [[08:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29005.98s)]
*  A job where they can excel. [[08:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29007.98s)]
*  A business that they can start. [[08:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29009.98s)]
*  A community [[08:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29011.98s)]
*  where they will thrive [[08:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29013.98s)]
*  and succeed. A nice home where they'll [[08:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29015.98s)]
*  raise families in the future [[08:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29017.98s)]
*  and give grandchildren to their parents. [[08:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29019.98s)]
*  That is the beautiful [[08:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29021.98s)]
*  future that we have. I call it the Canadian [[08:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29023.98s)]
*  promise. Let's bring it home for a change. [[08:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29025.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29027.98s)]
*  We will now go to the final [[08:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29031.98s)]
*  question. [[08:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29033.98s)]
*  Hi, Mr. [[08:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29035.98s)]
*  Poliev. Triya Isri, Global News. [[08:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29037.98s)]
*  Canada could be headed into [[08:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29039.98s)]
*  a recession, yet your platform [[08:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29041.98s)]
*  does not account for this uncertainty. [[08:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29043.98s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[08:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29045.98s)]
*  Well, my platform [[08:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29047.98s)]
*  when you say it doesn't [[08:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29049.98s)]
*  account for that, can you explain [[08:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29051.98s)]
*  what you mean by that? [[08:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29053.98s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects [[08:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29055.98s)]
*  growth based on projects that have yet to [[08:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29057.98s)]
*  happen by repealing [[08:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29059.98s)]
*  C-69, by having [[08:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29061.98s)]
*  growth with pipelines that could take years. [[08:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29063.98s)]
*  So I just wonder should you have [[08:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29065.98s)]
*  erred more on the side of caution [[08:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29067.98s)]
*  given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade [[08:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29069.98s)]
*  war? [[08:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29071.98s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason [[08:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29073.98s)]
*  that the economy has no growth and has been in a per capita [[08:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29075.98s)]
*  recession for the last five years [[08:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29077.98s)]
*  is because of [[08:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29079.98s)]
*  the policies that Mark Carney [[08:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29081.98s)]
*  advised Justin Trudeau's liberals to [[08:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29083.98s)]
*  implement. They are the reckless ones. [[08:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29085.98s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most [[08:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29087.98s)]
*  reckless of all is that [[08:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29089.98s)]
*  in a period of uncertainty, [[08:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29091.98s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the [[08:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29093.98s)]
*  spending that Justin Trudeau planned [[08:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29095.98s)]
*  and then stack $130 [[08:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29097.98s)]
*  billion more spending [[08:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29099.98s)]
*  on top of that for a total of quarter [[08:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29101.98s)]
*  trillion dollars of extra [[08:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29103.98s)]
*  inflationary debt [[08:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29105.98s)]
*  that will drive up the cost of food [[08:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29107.98s)]
*  and fuel. Now, you asked me [[08:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29109.98s)]
*  in a period of economic weakness [[08:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29111.98s)]
*  after the [[08:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29113.98s)]
*  liberals have been in power for three terms [[08:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29115.98s)]
*  whether it is wise to [[08:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29117.98s)]
*  campaign on [[08:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29119.98s)]
*  economic growth? [[08:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29121.98s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's [[08:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29123.98s)]
*  essential for a change that we grow our [[08:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29125.98s)]
*  economy. We need to unleash [[08:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29127.98s)]
*  courses. [[08:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29129.98s)]
*  What is [[08:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29131.98s)]
*  what would be [[08:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29133.98s)]
*  reckless is to continue with [[08:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29135.98s)]
*  the same liberal policies. [[08:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29137.98s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill [[08:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29139.98s)]
*  C-69. He wants to keep [[08:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29141.98s)]
*  half of our oil in the ground. [[08:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29143.98s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new [[08:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29145.98s)]
*  industrial carbon tax [[08:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29147.98s)]
*  on the steel mills here at [[08:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29149.98s)]
*  Stelco and [[08:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29151.98s)]
*  DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma [[08:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29153.98s)]
*  and [[08:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29155.98s)]
*  Everaz to shut down our steel [[08:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29157.98s)]
*  industry with taxes. That is [[08:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29159.98s)]
*  more liberal recklessness. [[08:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29161.98s)]
*  What is actually responsible [[08:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29163.98s)]

*  put on a uniform and they leave [[08:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29473.98s)]
*  in the morning kissing their kids goodbye [[08:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29475.98s)]

*  Yesterday, [[08:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29483.98s)]
*  I released a plan for change [[08:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29485.98s)]

*  more affordable and safe in our [[08:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29489.98s)]
*  country. Change means safe [[08:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29491.98s)]
*  streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[08:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29493.98s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources [[08:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29495.98s)]
*  so we can stand on our own two feet [[08:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29497.98s)]
*  and stand up to the world from a position [[08:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29499.98s)]
*  of strength. Over the next [[08:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29501.98s)]
*  four years, my plan will cut [[08:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29503.98s)]
*  $55 billion [[08:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29505.98s)]
*  of bureaucracy, [[08:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29507.98s)]
*  consultants, foreign aid, [[08:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29509.98s)]
*  and liberal waste [[08:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29511.98s)]
*  in order to reduce [[08:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29513.98s)]
*  by 70% [[08:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29515.98s)]
*  the liberal deficit that we will inherit [[08:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29517.98s)]
*  on Monday. [[08:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29519.98s)]
*  By contrast, [[08:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29529.98s)]
*  we learned that Mark Carney's platform [[08:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29531.98s)]
*  was actually written [[08:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29533.98s)]
*  for Justin Trudeau. [[08:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29535.98s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[08:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29537.98s)]
*  The platform team [[08:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29539.98s)]
*  of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform [[08:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29541.98s)]
*  in the fall and they gave it to [[08:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29543.98s)]
*  Trudeau. And then when [[08:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29545.98s)]
*  they switched him out and [[08:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29547.98s)]
*  replaced him with his economic [[08:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29549.98s)]
*  advisor, [[08:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29551.98s)]
*  we've got a [[08:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29553.98s)]
*  cough there. We're okay? [[08:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29555.98s)]
*  All right. [[08:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29557.98s)]
*  It was, I think he was reacting [[08:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29559.98s)]
*  to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[08:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29561.98s)]
*  You know, I always [[08:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29571.98s)]
*  like to tell the story of when [[08:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29573.98s)]
*  our little baby boy was born [[08:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29575.98s)]
*  and he came out and little baby [[08:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29577.98s)]
*  Cruz, and he wasn't crying. And of course, [[08:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29579.98s)]
*  that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[08:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29581.98s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered [[08:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29583.98s)]
*  something in his ear. And all of a sudden [[08:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29585.98s)]
*  a great cry went out and we were so [[08:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29587.98s)]
*  relieved that he was going to be okay. So we held him in our [[08:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29589.98s)]
*  arms. And afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I [[08:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29591.98s)]
*  said, doctor, what did you tell [[08:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29593.98s)]
*  our little infant to make him cry [[08:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29595.98s)]
*  ever so much? He said, well, I just told [[08:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29597.98s)]
*  him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[08:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29599.98s)]
*  But it's about to get [[08:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29609.98s)]
*  a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[08:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29611.98s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29613.98s)]
*  they wrote it for Trudeau, and then [[08:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29615.98s)]
*  Mark Carney takes the leadership [[08:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29617.98s)]
*  and doesn't bother [[08:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29619.98s)]
*  to write his own plan because he has [[08:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29621.98s)]
*  his plan has been [[08:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29623.98s)]
*  carried out over the last five [[08:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29625.98s)]
*  years while he was Trudeau's [[08:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29627.98s)]
*  economic advisor. So why would he presume [[08:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29629.98s)]
*  to change anything? Well, [[08:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29631.98s)]
*  there is one thing he changed. [[08:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29633.98s)]
*  In addition to all of [[08:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29635.98s)]
*  the spending that Trudeau had already [[08:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29637.98s)]
*  budgeted for, [[08:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29639.98s)]
*  Mark Carney's plan would add [[08:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29641.98s)]
*  $130 billion more. [[08:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29643.98s)]
*  When you take [[08:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29645.98s)]
*  Trudeau's plans [[08:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29647.98s)]
*  and Carney's promises, a fourth [[08:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29649.98s)]
*  liberal term would mean [[08:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29651.98s)]
*  a quarter trillion dollars [[08:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29653.98s)]
*  of additional inflationary debt [[08:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29655.98s)]
*  that will drive up food and housing [[08:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29657.98s)]
*  prices even more. In fact, [[08:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29659.98s)]
*  Mark Carney, I've said he's no [[08:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29661.98s)]
*  different than Trudeau. The truth is [[08:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29663.98s)]
*  he will cost even more than Justin [[08:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29665.98s)]
*  Trudeau. He has [[08:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29667.98s)]
*  phantom numbers he can't explain. [[08:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29669.98s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out [[08:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29671.98s)]
*  at even liberal economists. Liberal [[08:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29673.98s)]
*  economist Trevor Toome [[08:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29675.98s)]
*  said that Mark Carney's [[08:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29677.98s)]
*  platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[08:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29679.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly [[08:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29681.98s)]
*  lashed out, not wanting [[08:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29683.98s)]
*  people to know how much [[08:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29685.98s)]
*  liberal inflation he would bring [[08:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29687.98s)]
*  if he were to be reelected [[08:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29689.98s)]
*  for a fourth liberal term. [[08:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29691.98s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[08:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29693.98s)]
*  Can you afford [[08:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29695.98s)]
*  a fourth liberal term [[08:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29697.98s)]
*  of a quarter trillion dollars [[08:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29699.98s)]
*  more inflationary debt? [[08:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29701.98s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[08:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29703.98s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, [[08:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29705.98s)]
*  to pay for it all, he would have to raise [[08:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29707.98s)]
*  taxes. There's no question [[08:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29709.98s)]
*  he would reinstate the tax [[08:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29711.98s)]
*  increases Trudeau had planned. [[08:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29713.98s)]
*  He would raise other taxes [[08:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29715.98s)]
*  only on others, not on him. He would stash [[08:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29717.98s)]
*  his cash in overseas tax havens. [[08:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29719.98s)]
*  But over the [[08:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29721.98s)]
*  last lost liberal decade, [[08:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29723.98s)]
*  Canada is heading in the wrong [[08:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29725.98s)]
*  direction and fast. [[08:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29727.98s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week [[08:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29729.98s)]
*  about the government, the liberal government [[08:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29731.98s)]
*  actually published a report about how [[08:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29733.98s)]
*  the country will look in 15 years. [[08:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29735.98s)]
*  Now, this is important because what [[08:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29737.98s)]
*  liberals have been telling you is forget about the last [[08:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29739.98s)]
*  10 years of liberal [[08:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29741.98s)]
*  government. Pretend it didn't happen. [[08:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29743.98s)]
*  That was then, this is now, the past is [[08:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29745.98s)]
*  the past. Forget about it. [[08:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29747.98s)]
*  Well, what does the future [[08:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29749.98s)]
*  look like? Not according to me, [[08:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29751.98s)]
*  but according to them. [[08:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29753.98s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[08:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29755.98s)]
*  You know, it would be nice, frankly, [[08:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29757.98s)]
*  this is a draw dropping report to be published [[08:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29759.98s)]
*  by the government of Canada [[08:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29761.98s)]
*  before the election. Future lives, [[08:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29763.98s)]
*  social mobility in question. [[08:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29765.98s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's [[08:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29767.98s)]
*  own report. If I had alleged the [[08:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29769.98s)]
*  things in this report, the media would be [[08:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29771.98s)]
*  attacking me as outlandish. [[08:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29773.98s)]
*  But this is what the government says [[08:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29775.98s)]
*  the future has in store on our current [[08:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29777.98s)]
*  trajectory. And I [[08:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29779.98s)]
*  will emphasize that this [[08:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29781.98s)]
*  is their own words. [[08:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29783.98s)]
*  This is what they have to say. I say that [[08:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29785.98s)]
*  many times just so, because the shock [[08:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29787.98s)]
*  value of this report is so massive [[08:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29789.98s)]
*  that you would be, [[08:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29791.98s)]
*  you would find it hard to believe the things [[08:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29793.98s)]
*  that they say. The report says that [[08:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29795.98s)]
*  in 2040, more people [[08:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29797.98s)]
*  may struggle to afford rent, bills, [[08:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29799.98s)]
*  and groceries on housing. In 2040, [[08:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29801.98s)]
*  owning a home is not a realistic [[08:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29803.98s)]
*  goal for many. And inequality between [[08:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29805.98s)]
*  those who rent and those who own [[08:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29807.98s)]
*  has become a key social driver, [[08:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29809.98s)]
*  a key driver of social, economic, [[08:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29811.98s)]
*  and political conflict. [[08:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29813.98s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture [[08:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29815.98s)]
*  of national spiral [[08:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29817.98s)]
*  of depression and decline. [[08:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29819.98s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental [[08:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29821.98s)]
*  health crises, quote, if young [[08:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29823.98s)]
*  workers, forcing young workers [[08:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29825.98s)]
*  to actually leave the country. [[08:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29827.98s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting [[08:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29829.98s)]
*  now, it may be harder to pay for the [[08:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29831.98s)]
*  systems that support a growing number [[08:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29833.98s)]
*  of older people. It says that [[08:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29835.98s)]
*  people will lose faith [[08:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29837.98s)]
*  in the Canadian project altogether. [[08:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29839.98s)]
*  And this, the most [[08:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29841.98s)]
*  startling comment of all, that [[08:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29843.98s)]
*  food prices will become so [[08:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29845.98s)]
*  unaffordable on the current path that [[08:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29847.98s)]
*  people may have to start, quote, [[08:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29849.98s)]
*  hunt, hunt, might have to start [[08:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29851.98s)]
*  hunt, fish, and forage [[08:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29853.98s)]
*  on public lands [[08:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29855.98s)]
*  and waterways. You imagine [[08:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29857.98s)]
*  in Canada, [[08:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29859.98s)]
*  where people are to the point where they [[08:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29861.98s)]
*  can't even go into a grocery store [[08:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29863.98s)]
*  anymore, and they actually have to go [[08:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29865.98s)]
*  forage on public lands in order to scrape [[08:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29867.98s)]
*  out an existence. This sounds [[08:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29869.98s)]
*  incredible, like something from a [[08:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29871.98s)]
*  post-apocalyptic television [[08:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29873.98s)]
*  series like The Fallout, [[08:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29875.98s)]
*  The Last of Us, but this [[08:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29877.98s)]
*  is not that. It is a liberal [[08:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29879.98s)]
*  government forecast. And it's not [[08:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29881.98s)]
*  for 100 years from now, it's for 15 [[08:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29883.98s)]
*  years from now. Is that the future [[08:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29885.98s)]
*  that you want for your kids? [[08:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29887.98s)]
*  No. That is not change. [[08:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29889.98s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary [[08:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29891.98s)]
*  spiral the Liberals [[08:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29893.98s)]
*  have brought us over the last decade. [[08:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29895.98s)]
*  And Mark Carney will [[08:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29897.98s)]
*  continue with every single policy [[08:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29899.98s)]
*  he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[08:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29901.98s)]
*  He might look different, [[08:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29903.98s)]
*  he might use more different buzzwords, [[08:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29905.98s)]
*  but it is exactly the same liberal [[08:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29907.98s)]
*  agenda. We cannot afford a fourth [[08:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29909.98s)]
*  liberal turn. After 10 years [[08:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29911.98s)]
*  of liberal government, predictions [[08:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29913.98s)]
*  about housing shortages, mental health [[08:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29915.98s)]
*  crises, and a loss of hope [[08:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29917.98s)]
*  for many Canadians is already [[08:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29919.98s)]
*  the reality. It's funny, yesterday a CBC [[08:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29921.98s)]
*  post was saying, well, [[08:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29923.98s)]
*  are all of these terrible things [[08:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29925.98s)]
*  in this government report [[08:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29927.98s)]
*  really realistic? Could they really happen [[08:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29929.98s)]
*  in 15 years? [[08:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29931.98s)]
*  And to her credit, [[08:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29933.98s)]
*  another journalist said, well, for a lot [[08:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29935.98s)]
*  of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[08:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29937.98s)]
*  That's how desperate [[08:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29939.98s)]
*  the situation has already become [[08:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29941.98s)]
*  after 10 years [[08:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29943.98s)]
*  of liberal government. [[08:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29945.98s)]
*  So the choice of this election could not [[08:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29947.98s)]
*  be clearer. A fourth term liberal [[08:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29949.98s)]
*  term with Mark Carney, whose plan [[08:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29951.98s)]
*  is even more reckless and costly than [[08:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29953.98s)]
*  Justin Trudeau's, or a new [[08:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29955.98s)]
*  conservative government that will [[08:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29957.98s)]
*  cut waste and bureaucracy, [[08:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29959.98s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash [[08:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29961.98s)]
*  home building and resource development [[08:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29963.98s)]
*  so that Canadians can afford a good life [[08:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29965.98s)]
*  on a safe street. That's the choice before us today. [[08:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29967.98s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade, nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[08:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29969.98s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, [[08:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29997.98s)]
*  the violence [[08:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=29999.98s)]
*  and the fear that is now overtaking [[08:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30001.98s)]
*  our streets because of liberal [[08:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30003.98s)]
*  drug [[08:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30005.98s)]

*  border and other [[08:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30009.98s)]
*  policies. Violent crime is up [[08:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30011.98s)]
*  15%, gun crime [[08:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30013.98s)]
*  up a shocking 116%, [[08:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30015.98s)]
*  extortion and auto [[08:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30017.98s)]
*  theft up 357%, [[08:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30019.98s)]
*  and 46%, [[08:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30021.98s)]
*  respectively. [[08:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30023.98s)]
*  And you're, you are [[08:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30025.98s)]
*  the ones facing it on the front lines, the police [[08:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30027.98s)]
*  officers here with me today, and there [[08:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30029.98s)]
*  are many police officers in this crowd. They're the [[08:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30031.98s)]
*  ones facing it. Here in Hamilton, [[08:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30033.98s)]
*  an innocent young woman was killed [[08:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30035.98s)]
*  waiting for the bus [[08:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30037.98s)]
*  to go to work just the other [[08:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30039.98s)]
*  day. The shot was apparently [[08:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30041.98s)]
*  fired from a passing SUV [[08:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30043.98s)]
*  at another car, [[08:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30045.98s)]
*  but missed and hit her instead. [[08:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30047.98s)]
*  She was a student studying [[08:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30049.98s)]
*  at Mohawk College, [[08:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30051.98s)]
*  with her whole life ahead of her. [[08:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30053.98s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless [[08:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30055.98s)]
*  tragedy. Also this [[08:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30057.98s)]
*  week, the court is hearing closing [[08:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30059.98s)]
*  arguments in the case of two individuals [[08:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30061.98s)]

*  Again, he was a young [[08:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30069.98s)]
*  man, a heroic young man [[08:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30071.98s)]
*  with his entire life ahead of him. [[08:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30073.98s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss [[08:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30075.98s)]
*  has left his family [[08:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30077.98s)]
*  and law enforcement with holes [[08:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30079.98s)]
*  in their hearts. [[08:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30081.98s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, [[08:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30083.98s)]
*  had a criminal record a mile [[08:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30085.98s)]
*  long, and is so [[08:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30087.98s)]
*  often the case, he was [[08:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30089.98s)]
*  out on bail [[08:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30091.98s)]
*  for one violent offense [[08:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30093.98s)]
*  when he allegedly committed this [[08:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30095.98s)]
*  crime. Imagine [[08:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30097.98s)]
*  where we would be today. [[08:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30099.98s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. [[08:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30101.98s)]
*  Piershalla's family would be today [[08:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30103.98s)]
*  if he had not been released on bail. [[08:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30105.98s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes [[08:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30107.98s)]
*  throughout laws were actually [[08:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30109.98s)]
*  in place and he had been [[08:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30111.98s)]
*  locked away. What would [[08:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30113.98s)]
*  have happened? And more importantly, what would [[08:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30115.98s)]
*  not have happened? Sadly, these [[08:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30117.98s)]
*  kinds of tragedies have become all too common in [[08:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30119.98s)]
*  recent years. For the last 10 years, the liberal [[08:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30121.98s)]
*  government has unleashed [[08:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30123.98s)]
*  this crime with [[08:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30125.98s)]
*  lax laws like C-75, [[08:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30127.98s)]
*  which requires [[08:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30129.98s)]
*  judges release offenders [[08:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30131.98s)]

*  onerous conditions at the earliest [[08:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30135.98s)]
*  opportunity, a law that Mark Carney [[08:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30137.98s)]
*  has pledged, a liberal law that Mark [[08:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30139.98s)]
*  Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[08:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30141.98s)]
*  Liberals brought in house [[08:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30143.98s)]
*  arrests, C-5, which allows [[08:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30145.98s)]
*  repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living [[08:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30147.98s)]
*  rooms, watching Netflix [[08:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30149.98s)]
*  able to walk out the door at any time [[08:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30151.98s)]
*  to reoffend. And [[08:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30153.98s)]
*  instead of promising to work with law enforcement [[08:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30155.98s)]
*  to end the crime and chaos, [[08:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30157.98s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal [[08:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30159.98s)]
*  policies in place. He [[08:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30161.98s)]
*  wants to ban hunting rifles [[08:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30163.98s)]
*  rather than banning gun criminals. [[08:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30165.98s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to [[08:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30167.98s)]
*  law enforcement and work with them [[08:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30169.98s)]
*  so that together we can reverse [[08:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30171.98s)]
*  the dangerous liberal crime [[08:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30173.98s)]
*  wave of the last decade and bring home [[08:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30175.98s)]
*  Safe Streets for a change, for a [[08:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30177.98s)]
*  change, for a change. [[08:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30179.98s)]
*  Safe [[08:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30181.98s)]
*  Streets used to be something we took for [[08:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30191.98s)]
*  granted. People in Canada, in many communities, [[08:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30193.98s)]
*  it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors [[08:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30195.98s)]
*  unlocked. They had to sleep with [[08:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30197.98s)]
*  their doors unlocked. It was [[08:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30199.98s)]
*  incredible. And now [[08:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30201.98s)]
*  we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of [[08:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30203.98s)]
*  Police has to tell Torontonians [[08:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30205.98s)]
*  leave your car keys [[08:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30207.98s)]
*  next to the front door so that if someone [[08:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30209.98s)]
*  wants to steal your vehicle, they [[08:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30211.98s)]
*  can safely do it. They can just come in and [[08:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30213.98s)]
*  take the keys and leave with the car without hurting [[08:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30215.98s)]
*  anybody. Is this how we keep [[08:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30217.98s)]
*  people safe? We say give [[08:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30219.98s)]
*  your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you [[08:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30221.98s)]
*  or stab you? This is [[08:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30223.98s)]
*  insanity. But of course it is [[08:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30225.98s)]
*  what life looks like after [[08:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30227.98s)]
*  this lost liberal decade. [[08:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30229.98s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this [[08:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30231.98s)]
*  total meltdown [[08:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30233.98s)]

*  on the current path [[08:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30239.98s)]
*  is the horrible homeless encampments. [[08:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30241.98s)]
*  In Ontario alone, [[08:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30243.98s)]
*  after the lost liberal decade, [[08:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30245.98s)]
*  there are 1,400 [[08:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30247.98s)]
*  homeless encampments. It is [[08:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30249.98s)]
*  unimaginable. It's like [[08:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30251.98s)]
*  something out of the Great Depression. [[08:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30253.98s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless [[08:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30255.98s)]
*  encampments more than doubled in [[08:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30257.98s)]
*  just one year from 82 [[08:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30259.98s)]
*  in 2023 to [[08:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30261.98s)]
*  200 today. [[08:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30263.98s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% [[08:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30265.98s)]
*  since 2018. [[08:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30267.98s)]
*  Roughly the time, it's interesting, [[08:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30269.98s)]
*  Mark Carney became the economic advisor in [[08:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30271.98s)]
*  2020. And what has happened? [[08:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30273.98s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[08:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30275.98s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up [[08:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30277.98s)]
*  38%. That is [[08:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30279.98s)]
*  the legacy of this liberal government. [[08:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30281.98s)]
*  The Liberals promised to eliminate [[08:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30283.98s)]
*  chronic homelessness. Instead [[08:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30285.98s)]
*  it went through the roof. And now they expect [[08:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30287.98s)]
*  you to believe their promises for a fourth [[08:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30289.98s)]
*  time and a fourth liberal term. [[08:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30291.98s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable [[08:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30293.98s)]
*  and condemned them to sidewalks [[08:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30295.98s)]
*  and back alleys. Encampments [[08:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30297.98s)]
*  now fill spaces where children once [[08:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30299.98s)]
*  played and families once gathered. [[08:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30301.98s)]
*  Our public spaces have [[08:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30303.98s)]
*  become a breeding grounds for addiction, [[08:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30305.98s)]
*  violence, human trafficking [[08:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30307.98s)]
*  and crime. Businesses around parks [[08:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30309.98s)]
*  have been boarded up. Parents [[08:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30311.98s)]
*  are afraid to let their kids cut [[08:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30313.98s)]
*  through parks on their way to school. [[08:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30315.98s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our [[08:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30317.98s)]
*  brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, [[08:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30319.98s)]
*  they are left to suffer in the cold [[08:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30321.98s)]
*  to overdose and sometimes [[08:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30323.98s)]
*  to die alone. [[08:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30325.98s)]
*  These are places where half [[08:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30327.98s)]

*  spinal cords twisted from countless [[08:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30335.98s)]

*  immense power of the poison [[08:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30345.98s)]
*  running through their bodies [[08:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30347.98s)]
*  and their minds. And the [[08:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30349.98s)]
*  Liberals just say, let it continue. [[08:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30351.98s)]
*  In fact, their policy has [[08:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30353.98s)]
*  been to supply even more drugs, [[08:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30355.98s)]
*  more opioids, [[08:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30357.98s)]
*  keep the problem going [[08:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30359.98s)]

*  of everything this last liberal [[08:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30371.98s)]

*  individuals who are a danger to public safety [[08:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30569.1s)]
*  and clear public spaces where access is [[08:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30571.52s)]
*  currently blocked by tents and temporary [[08:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30573.54s)]

*  No more excuses by [[08:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30575.96s)]
*  politicians claiming they don't have the [[08:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30577.64s)]
*  powers. [[08:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30579.239999999998s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the [[08:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30580.3s)]
*  criminal code. [[08:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30582.38s)]
*  No more paralysis [[08:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30583.34s)]

*  Second, we will provide [[08:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30589.02s)]
*  addiction treatment to 50,000 [[08:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30590.34s)]

*  preventing them from succeeding in that [[08:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30599.0s)]

*  addiction treatment. [[08:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30602.1s)]

*  problem. [[08:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30604.62s)]
*  We will offer mental health [[08:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30605.44s)]
*  supports, job training so police [[08:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30606.66s)]

*  get into the home they need. [[08:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30616.539999999997s)]
*  We will give judges the power to [[08:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30618.42s)]
*  order the people charged for [[08:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30620.62s)]

*  treatment. [[08:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30627.48s)]
*  So we're not here to [[08:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30628.36s)]
*  give people a way out. [[08:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30630.36s)]

*  APPLAUSE [[08:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30654.34s)]
*  And for more serious [[08:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30662.54s)]
*  criminals, where addiction is a [[08:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30664.04s)]
*  factor in their crime, but where [[08:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30665.74s)]
*  their crime requires they do jail time, [[08:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30667.74s)]

*  tests for prisoners because we know [[08:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30677.14s)]
*  that if someone comes out [[08:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30679.14s)]
*  continually addicted to drugs, [[08:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=30680.76s)]

*  What is the mo nay, [[08:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31093.48s)]
*  What is the position of the Conservatives in the C-18 bill that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[08:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31095.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. A good question. [[08:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31104.24s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[08:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31108.24s)]
*  Liberal politicians have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. Independent media are now blocked from sharing their stories. [[08:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31118.24s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they've inflated inflation, housing prices, and criminal activities in our streets. [[08:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31131.24s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. They want to control everything. [[08:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31140.24s)]
*  First of all, we can't allow a fourth liberal mandate to inflate housing prices and criminal activities out of control. [[08:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31144.24s)]
*  With a new Conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[08:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31158.24s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, and safe streets. [[08:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31173.24s)]
*  That's the choice in elections. After a decade of increasing costs and crime, can we allow a fourth mandate or should it change to give you a better life in the safe communities? [[08:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31181.24s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth mandate to inflate housing prices and criminal activities out of control. [[08:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31211.24s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they've inflated inflation, housing prices, criminal activities, and criminal activities in our streets. [[08:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31219.24s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of Liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current Liberal track. [[08:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31231.24s)]
*  It's not surprising that Liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[08:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31257.24s)]
*  But a fourth Liberal term is not the answer. What we need is a new Conservative government to bring change. Change so you can afford food and homes. Change so there's safety in your streets. Change so that we have freedom of expression. Thank you very much. [[08:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31262.24s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[08:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31277.24s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. Sorry, I can't. Chris Arnold with Village Media. Thank you. I would like to actually build on the previous question. You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[08:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31283.24s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[08:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31295.24s)]
*  I can commit to that. I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local journalism initiative. [[08:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31305.24s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. It shouldn't only go to the Liberal government's favoured media outlets. [[08:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31317.24s)]
*  And you know the Liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos Liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[08:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31329.24s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth Liberal term. It's not just local media that are suffering under the Liberals. It's everybody. [[08:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31344.24s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[08:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31353.24s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[08:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31361.24s)]
*  And they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if the Liberal policies remain in place. We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[08:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31375.24s)]
*  We need a change. This election really comes down to one word. It's change. Change, change, change. Change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change so that you are safe in your street. [[08:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31388.24s)]
*  This election is about change. Thank you. [[08:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31401.24s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[08:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31404.24s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[08:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31406.24s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[08:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31422.24s)]
*  You know, he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun? You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[08:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31434.24s)]
*  There do need to be. Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[08:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31450.24s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[08:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31467.24s)]
*  And there's more poverty. 25% of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[08:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31484.24s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[08:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31494.24s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. We need to change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[08:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31505.24s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[08:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31519.24s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. Well, why is it? Because we're giving young people hope. Hope that they're going to have a better future. [[08:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31528.24s)]
*  Real hope for a change. I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[08:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31537.24s)]
*  A job where they can excel. A business that they can start. A community where they will thrive and succeed. [[08:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31547.24s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. That is the beautiful future that we have. I call it the Canadian promise. [[08:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31556.24s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. Thank you. [[08:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31566.24s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[08:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31568.24s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Poliev. Triya Izri, Global News. Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. How do you justify that? [[08:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31573.24s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain why? [[08:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31583.24s)]
*  Well, I think it's because of the fact that Canada is a country that is in a recession. [[08:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31589.24s)]
*  I think it's because of the fact that Canada is a country that is in a recession. [[08:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31597.24s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[08:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31605.24s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[08:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31613.24s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[08:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31623.24s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that in a period of uncertainty, Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of $250 million. [[08:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31635.24s)]
*  of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[08:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31651.24s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth. [[08:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31659.24s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[08:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31671.24s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[08:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31677.24s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[08:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31687.24s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everaz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[08:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31697.24s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the No Development Law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones and the oil. [[08:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31711.24s)]
*  We need to do things that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. Thank you very much. [[08:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31727.24s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[08:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31742.24s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. Thank you. [[08:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31746.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31757.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31787.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31817.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steel Town welcome. It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[08:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31831.24s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change. Change, change, change, change. [[08:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31840.24s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. Change so you are safe on your streets. Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[08:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31857.24s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[08:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31867.24s)]
*  That's the choice for Canadians. After 10 long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices inflated, the immigration system out of control, it needs to change and it's only the Conservatives that will change things. [[08:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31897.24s)]
*  I appreciate these shows. That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[08:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31918.24s)]
*  Ned in Hamilton East, Stoney Creek. [[08:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31922.24s)]
*  Dan Mews, Flambrough, Glanbrook, Grant North. [[08:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31934.24s)]
*  Erica Alexander, give her a round of applause. [[08:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31943.24s)]
*  She of course is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[08:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31951.24s)]
*  We have Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinser. Give them all a round of applause. [[08:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31970.24s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[08:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31987.24s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[08:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=31992.24s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people. The police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[08:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32018.24s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[08:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32033.24s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[08:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32052.24s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. This is not a figure of speech. The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[08:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32080.24s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh, we've got a little cough there. We're okay? All right. All right. I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[08:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32096.24s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[08:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32122.24s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. And all of a sudden a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. So we held him in our arms. [[08:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32133.24s)]
*  And afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[08:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32141.24s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[08:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32151.24s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's economic advisor. [[08:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32166.24s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? Well, there is one thing he changed. [[08:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32179.24s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[08:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32185.24s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[08:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32196.24s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[08:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32210.24s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[08:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32217.24s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[08:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32224.24s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[08:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32231.24s)]
*  Now, add it all up. Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[08:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32242.24s)]
*  Can you afford that? After the lost liberal decade? To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[08:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32253.24s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[08:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32259.24s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[08:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32264.24s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[08:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32271.24s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week with the government, the liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[08:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32279.24s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of liberal government. [[08:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32286.24s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. That was then. This is now. The past is the past. Forget about it. [[08:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32293.24s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? Not according to me, but according to them. [[08:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32298.24s)]
*  Well, they published this report. You know, it would be nice. [[08:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32304.24s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[08:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32308.24s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. This is the government of Canada's own report. [[08:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32314.24s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[08:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32320.24s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[08:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32325.24s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. This is what they have to say. [[08:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32330.24s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[08:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32336.24s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent, bills and groceries on housing. [[08:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32345.24s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[08:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32352.24s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[08:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32356.24s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[08:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32364.24s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[08:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32370.24s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[08:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32378.24s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[08:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32385.24s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[08:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32391.24s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[09:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32407.24s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout. [[09:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32420.24s)]
*  The last of us. But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[09:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32427.24s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. It's for 15 years from now. Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[09:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32432.24s)]
*  No, that is not change. That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[09:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32438.24s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[09:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32444.24s)]
*  They might he might look different. He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[09:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32453.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope. [[09:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32459.24s)]
*  For many Canadians is already the reality. It's funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[09:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32468.24s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[09:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32480.24s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[09:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32489.24s)]
*  So the choice in this election cannot be clearer. A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new Conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[09:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32497.24s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[09:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32511.24s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[09:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32518.24s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[09:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32526.24s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[09:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32536.24s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug, crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[09:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32547.24s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[09:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32562.24s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[09:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32575.24s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[09:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32583.24s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[09:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32585.24s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[09:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32591.24s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[09:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32599.24s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[09:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32605.24s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[09:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32608.24s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[09:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32619.24s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[09:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32625.24s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[09:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32632.24s)]
*  Imagine how imagine what where we would be today. [[09:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32647.24s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[09:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32650.24s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[09:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32656.24s)]
*  What would have happened? [[09:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32664.24s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[09:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32666.24s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[09:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32668.24s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under, quote, the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[09:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32671.24s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[09:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32688.24s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to reoffend. [[09:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32693.24s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[09:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32704.24s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[09:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32713.24s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[09:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32717.24s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[09:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32740.24s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[09:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32743.24s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. [[09:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32747.24s)]
*  It was incredible. [[09:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32750.24s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[09:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32752.24s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[09:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32764.24s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? [[09:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32767.24s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you. [[09:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32770.24s)]
*  This is insanity. [[09:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32775.24s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[09:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32776.24s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[09:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32781.24s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[09:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32794.24s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[09:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32800.24s)]
*  It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[09:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32802.24s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year, from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[09:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32805.24s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time, it's interesting, Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[09:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32814.24s)]
*  And what has happened? [[09:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32823.24s)]
*  Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[09:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32825.24s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[09:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32827.24s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[09:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32830.24s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[09:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32833.24s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. [[09:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32836.24s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[09:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32838.24s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[09:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32843.24s)]
*  The homeless encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[09:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32848.24s)]
*  Our public spaces have become breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[09:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32853.24s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[09:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32860.24s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[09:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32863.24s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[09:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32867.24s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl, twisted their spinal cords, twisted for countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[09:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32877.24s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[09:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32900.24s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[09:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32903.24s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[09:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32918.24s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain, and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[09:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32924.24s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion, it is chaos. [[09:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=32984.24s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro drug agenda, policies that have legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply, and then left the victims with no other options. [[09:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33013.24s)]
*  No, nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, no attempt to actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark, by Mark Carney, who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[09:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33027.24s)]
*  A new conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[09:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33047.24s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities, and we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life, a life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[09:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33064.24s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope, and the people who come out of these encampments into, from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[09:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33087.24s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys, and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[09:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33098.24s)]
*  So our plan is clear. First, we will amend the Criminal Code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[09:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33110.24s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. The powers will be right there in the Criminal Code. No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[09:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33124.24s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[09:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33139.24s)]
*  We will treat the problem. We will offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[09:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33154.24s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges, but we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[09:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33163.24s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemn them to that homelessness in the first place. [[09:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33180.24s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[09:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33201.24s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[09:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33224.24s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[09:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33234.24s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[09:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33251.24s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[09:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33257.24s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[09:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33267.24s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger and release public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[09:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33274.24s)]
*  We're going to make the police stop apologizing to politicians. [[09:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33295.24s)]
*  Second, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[09:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33298.24s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also a real support, including mental health services and professional training so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[09:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33309.24s)]
*  Third, if necessary, occupants will be subject to criminal prosecution, but we're going to give the judge the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces to simply put them in a drug position. [[09:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33329.24s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, we're going to give the judge the power to order treatment and common-sense tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of a real rehabilitation. [[09:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33347.24s)]
*  Like that, we're going to bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[09:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33375.24s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will be replaced with hope for a better future to make changes. [[09:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33385.24s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[09:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33393.24s)]
*  Our plan will ask the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[09:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33397.24s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[09:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33409.24s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[09:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33418.24s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[09:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33427.24s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[09:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33434.24s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[09:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33437.24s)]
*  But what has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[09:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33441.24s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[09:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33445.24s)]
*  So what happens then? Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[09:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33457.24s)]
*  Then they're addicted. Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[09:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33463.24s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[09:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33466.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[09:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33473.24s)]
*  We need a change. And that's why we're here offering that change. [[09:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33480.24s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[09:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33484.24s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[09:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33487.24s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, [[09:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33492.24s)]
*  where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[09:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33501.24s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[09:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33515.24s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[09:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33525.24s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[09:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33532.24s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars if we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again. [[09:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33538.24s)]
*  They are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[09:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33548.24s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[09:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33553.24s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[09:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33563.24s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[09:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33573.24s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[09:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33577.24s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[09:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33581.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33585.24s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[09:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33586.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33587.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33590.24s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[09:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33598.24s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[09:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33603.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33604.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33607.24s)]
*  Your first question comes from the line for Pierre Fontaine. [[09:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33608.24s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[09:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33611.24s)]
*  Hello, Mr. Poilier. [[09:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33627.24s)]
*  In this context, the media is refusing to pay its fair share of taxes to Canada and is blocking access to the content of our media. [[09:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33629.24s)]
*  Political parties have still bought thousands of dollars in ads on their platforms rather than supporting our local media. [[09:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33636.24s)]
*  So what is the position of the conservative party against the C-18 law that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[09:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33643.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33654.24s)]
*  A good question. [[09:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33655.24s)]
*  After the lost decade of the Liberals, we can't even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[09:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33657.24s)]
*  The policies of censor the Liberals have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. [[09:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33667.24s)]
*  Independent media are now blocked from sharing their history. [[09:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33675.24s)]
*  Perhaps that's what the Liberals want after they've inflated inflation, housing costs, criminalization of the rich. [[09:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33680.24s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. [[09:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33689.24s)]
*  They want to control everything. [[09:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33691.24s)]
*  We can't allow a fourth liberal mandate to inflate real estate, to control crime. [[09:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33693.24s)]
*  We need that to change. [[09:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33705.24s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[09:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33707.24s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, and safe streets. [[09:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33722.24s)]
*  That's the choice in the elections. [[09:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33731.24s)]
*  After a decade of liberal costs and crime that is increasing, can we allow a fourth mandate or does it need to change to give you a better life in the safe communities? [[09:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33733.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33746.24s)]
*  In English, please. [[09:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33747.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33748.24s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[09:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33749.24s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[09:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33752.24s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[09:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33762.24s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[09:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33768.24s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[09:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33776.24s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal system. [[09:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33780.24s)]
*  That's the whole track. [[09:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33806.24s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[09:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33807.24s)]
*  But at a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[09:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33812.24s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, change to their safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[09:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33815.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33826.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33827.24s)]
*  Next question. [[09:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33828.24s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[09:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33833.24s)]
*  Sorry. [[09:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33834.24s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[09:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33835.24s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[09:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33836.24s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[09:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33839.24s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[09:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33844.24s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[09:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33854.24s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local the local journalism initiative. [[09:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33856.24s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[09:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33866.24s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favoured media outlets. [[09:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33872.24s)]
*  And, you know, the liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[09:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33879.24s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[09:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33894.24s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[09:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33898.24s)]
*  It's everybody. [[09:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33901.24s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steelworkers here in Hamilton. [[09:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33902.24s)]
*  Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[09:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33907.24s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[09:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33910.24s)]
*  And we're not they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these if the liberal policies remain in place. [[09:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33924.24s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[09:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33931.24s)]
*  We need to change. [[09:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33939.24s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[09:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33940.24s)]
*  It's change. [[09:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33942.24s)]
*  Change, change, change, change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change that you are safe in your street. [[09:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33943.24s)]
*  This election is about change. [[09:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33951.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33953.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33954.24s)]
*  Next question. [[09:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33955.24s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[09:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33960.24s)]
*  My question is the long order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[09:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33966.24s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[09:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33971.24s)]
*  You know, he pulled first. [[09:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33983.24s)]
*  And but what's the kid doing with the gun? [[09:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33986.24s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[09:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33989.24s)]
*  What what what do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[09:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33993.24s)]
*  There do need to be. [[09:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=33999.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[09:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34000.24s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[09:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34016.24s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[09:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34023.24s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[09:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34027.24s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[09:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34033.24s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[09:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34036.24s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[09:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34040.24s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[09:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34045.24s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[09:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34050.24s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[09:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34056.24s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[09:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34058.24s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[09:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34069.24s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[09:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34074.24s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[09:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34081.24s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[09:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34084.24s)]
*  Because we're giving young people hope, hope that they're going to have a better future. [[09:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34085.24s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[09:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34090.24s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[09:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34095.24s)]
*  A job where they can excel. [[09:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34103.24s)]
*  A business that they can start. [[09:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34106.24s)]
*  A community where they will thrive and succeed. [[09:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34109.24s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grand children a better life. [[09:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34112.24s)]
*  And give grand children to their parents. [[09:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34119.24s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[09:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34121.24s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[09:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34124.24s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[09:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34126.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34127.24s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[09:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34132.24s)]
*  Hi, Mr. Polly. [[09:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34136.24s)]
*  I'm Trey Esri, Global News. [[09:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34137.24s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[09:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34139.24s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[09:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34145.24s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[09:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34148.24s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[09:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34154.24s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[09:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34165.24s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[09:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34172.24s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[09:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34185.24s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[09:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34187.24s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[09:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34192.24s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth. [[09:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34209.24s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[09:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34222.24s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[09:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34227.24s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[09:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34237.24s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[09:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34241.24s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[09:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34244.24s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everas to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[09:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34247.24s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[09:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34261.24s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law, C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[09:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34263.24s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[09:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34281.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34290.24s)]
*  Thank you, everyone. [[09:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34291.24s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[09:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34292.24s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[09:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34294.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34296.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34322.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34352.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34380.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[09:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34381.24s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[09:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34387.24s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday, and it comes down to one word, change. [[09:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34389.24s)]
*  Change, change, change, change. [[09:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34397.24s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[09:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34406.24s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[09:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34409.24s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[09:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34412.24s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[09:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34416.24s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[09:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34418.24s)]
*  The election is coming, and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[09:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34427.24s)]
*  Change, change for an affordable life, for food and affordable housing. [[09:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34436.24s)]
*  Change for a safe life. [[09:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34444.24s)]
*  Change for real. [[09:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34446.24s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[09:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34448.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34472.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34474.24s)]

*  Thank you. [[09:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34498.24s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[09:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34500.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34520.24s)]
*  Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinser. [[09:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34526.24s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[09:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34537.24s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official, the Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[09:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34542.24s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[09:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34568.24s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[09:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34578.24s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[09:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34583.24s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[09:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34591.24s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[09:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34594.24s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[09:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34601.24s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[09:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34629.24s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[09:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34636.24s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[09:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34639.24s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh, we've got a little cough there. [[09:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34646.24s)]
*  We're okay? All right. [[09:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34656.24s)]
*  All right. [[09:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34658.24s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[09:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34659.24s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[09:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34671.24s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[09:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34680.24s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[09:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34682.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[09:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34686.24s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. [[09:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34690.24s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[09:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34691.24s)]
*  And he said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[09:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34698.24s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[09:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34709.24s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[09:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34712.24s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[09:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34715.24s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. [[09:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34727.24s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? [[09:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34729.24s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[09:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34732.24s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[09:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34734.24s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[09:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34745.24s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[09:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34759.24s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[09:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34763.24s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[09:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34767.24s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[09:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34770.24s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[09:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34774.24s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[09:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34781.24s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[09:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34792.24s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[09:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34795.24s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[09:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34802.24s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade? [[09:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34803.24s)]
*  To pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[09:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34806.24s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[09:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34809.24s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[09:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34814.24s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[09:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34817.24s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[09:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34821.24s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[09:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34829.24s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[09:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34836.24s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[09:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34843.24s)]
*  That was then. [[09:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34844.24s)]
*  This is now. [[09:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34845.24s)]
*  The past is the past. [[09:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34846.24s)]
*  Forget about it. [[09:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34847.24s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[09:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34848.24s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[09:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34851.24s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[09:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34854.24s)]
*  You know, it'd be nice. [[09:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34856.24s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[09:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34858.24s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[09:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34863.24s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[09:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34866.24s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[09:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34869.24s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[09:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34874.24s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[09:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34879.24s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[09:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34884.24s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[09:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34886.24s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[09:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34895.24s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[09:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34902.24s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[09:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34905.24s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[09:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34914.24s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[09:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34920.24s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[09:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34928.24s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[09:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34935.24s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[09:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34941.24s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[09:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34957.24s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[09:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34964.24s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[09:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34969.24s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[09:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34977.24s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[09:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34981.24s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[09:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34983.24s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[09:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34985.24s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[09:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34987.24s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[09:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34990.24s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[09:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34993.24s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[09:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=34996.24s)]
*  They might he might look different. [[09:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35002.24s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[09:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35004.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government predictions about housing. [[09:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35009.24s)]
*  Shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[09:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35014.24s)]
*  It's funny yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[09:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35020.24s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[09:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35029.24s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[09:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35032.24s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become. [[09:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35038.24s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government. [[09:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35042.24s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[09:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35045.24s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[09:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35048.24s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[09:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35066.24s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[09:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35068.24s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[09:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35074.24s)]
*  The crime of the last liberal decade is a symbol of the loss of the right to live. [[09:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35085.24s)]
*  The violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal liberal drug crime drug criminal justice border and other policies. [[09:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35091.24s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. [[09:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35103.24s)]
*  Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent extortion and auto theft up 357 percent. [[09:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35106.24s)]
*  And 46 46 percent respectively. [[09:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35113.24s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[09:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35116.24s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[09:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35119.24s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[09:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35123.24s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[09:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35126.24s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a gun. [[09:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35132.24s)]
*  The police officers were there. [[09:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35135.24s)]
*  Waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[09:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35137.24s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[09:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35141.24s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[09:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35149.24s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[09:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35155.24s)]
*  Also this week the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[09:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35158.24s)]
*  Again he was a young man a real heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[09:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35169.24s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[09:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35174.24s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie one of the accused had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail. [[09:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35182.24s)]
*  For one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[09:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35192.24s)]
*  Imagine imagine where we would be today. [[09:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35197.24s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[09:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35200.24s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[09:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35206.24s)]
*  What would have happened and more importantly what would not have happened. [[09:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35213.24s)]
*  Sadly these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years for the last 10 years the Liberal government has unleashed this crime. [[09:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35217.24s)]
*  With lax laws like C 75 which requires judges release offenders under quote the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity. [[09:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35225.24s)]
*  A law that Mark Carney has pledged a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[09:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35237.24s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest C5 which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms walking and watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to reoffend. [[09:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35243.24s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos. [[09:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35253.24s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[09:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35258.24s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[09:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35262.24s)]
*  As prime minister I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the did the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change. [[09:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35266.24s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted people in Canada in many communities it's hard to believe this now used to leave their doors unlocked. [[09:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35283.24s)]
*  To sleep with other with their doors unlocked it was incredible. [[09:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35297.24s)]
*  It's incredible and now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle they can safely do it and just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[09:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35301.24s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe we say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you. [[09:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35317.24s)]
*  This is insanity. [[09:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35324.24s)]
*  But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[09:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35326.24s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments in Ontario alone. [[09:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35331.24s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade there are 1400 homeless and commitments. [[09:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35346.24s)]
*  It is unimaginable. [[09:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35351.24s)]
*  This is the worst thing out of the great depression in Toronto the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today homelessness is up 20% since 2018 roughly the time it's interesting Mark Carney became the economic advisor in 2020. [[09:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35353.24s)]
*  And what has happened homelessness has gone up by 20% chronic homelessness up 38%. [[09:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35374.24s)]
*  That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[09:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35380.24s)]
*  The liberals promise to eliminate crowd chronic homelessness instead it went through the roof and now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[09:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35383.24s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction violence, human trafficking and crime. [[09:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35393.24s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[09:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35409.24s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school and for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbors, they are left to suffer in the cold to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[09:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35412.24s)]
*  These are places where half dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl twisted their spinal cords twisted from countless hours hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[09:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35426.24s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[09:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35450.24s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed expanding this problem. [[09:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35453.24s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us doubling housing costs out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain and of course rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[09:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35467.24s)]
*  The liberals have been promied to eliminate the chronic ignorance. [[09:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35486.24s)]
*  They have rather abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[09:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35489.24s)]
*  Camps have now invaded the places where children played before and where families gathered in all security. [[09:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35497.24s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[09:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35510.24s)]
*  The businesses located around the parks have been condemned. [[09:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35520.24s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children pass through the parks to go to school. [[09:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35524.24s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[09:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35532.24s)]
*  This is not compassion. [[09:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35546.24s)]
*  It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the Liberals. [[09:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35548.24s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[09:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35554.24s)]
*  It is chaos. [[09:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35561.24s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs, pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no other options. [[09:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35563.24s)]
*  Nothing for treatment. [[09:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35576.24s)]
*  Nothing for recovery. [[09:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35578.24s)]
*  No attempt to actually get people off drugs. [[09:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35580.24s)]
*  And no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[09:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35582.24s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[09:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35596.24s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[09:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35602.24s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[09:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35605.24s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[09:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35609.24s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, and a safe environment. [[09:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35615.24s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[09:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35621.24s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[09:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35623.24s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come out of these encampments. [[09:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35633.24s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[09:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35637.24s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[09:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35645.24s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[09:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35651.24s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[09:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35654.24s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[09:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35660.24s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[09:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35662.24s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[09:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35674.24s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[09:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35679.24s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[09:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35682.24s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[09:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35688.24s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[09:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35693.24s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[09:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35697.24s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[09:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35704.24s)]
*  We'll go for mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[09:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35706.24s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges. [[09:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35713.24s)]
*  But we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places. [[09:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35717.24s)]
*  We will give judges a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[09:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35725.24s)]
*  So we're not here to, we're here to give people a way out. [[09:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35730.24s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[09:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35734.24s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, [[09:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35751.24s)]
*  we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[09:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35768.24s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[09:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35774.24s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, [[09:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35783.24s)]
*  then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[09:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35794.24s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[09:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35801.24s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[09:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35804.24s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. [[09:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35807.24s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[09:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35812.24s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[09:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35817.24s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. [[09:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35823.24s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger [[09:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35825.24s)]
*  and release public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[09:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35837.24s)]
*  Finish the apologies by politicians. [[09:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35845.24s)]
*  Secondly, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[09:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35848.24s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also real support, including treatment, mental health services, and professional training [[09:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35859.24s)]
*  so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[09:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35869.24s)]
*  Thirdly, if necessary, occupants will be subject to criminal proceedings, [[09:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35878.24s)]
*  but we're going to give the judges the power to order people who are accused of illegal occupation in public spaces [[09:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35884.24s)]
*  for the simple drug position and the site. [[09:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35893.24s)]
*  We're going to give the judges the option to order treatment against drugs. [[09:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35897.24s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, [[09:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35902.24s)]
*  we're going to give the judges the power to order treatment and joint taxi tests inside prisons [[09:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35909.24s)]
*  to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[09:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35917.24s)]
*  That way, we're going to bring back hope to make change, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[09:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35924.24s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will be replaced with hope for a better future to make change. [[09:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35934.24s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[09:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35942.24s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes, [[09:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35946.24s)]
*  to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[09:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35953.24s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land, and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[09:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35958.24s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[09:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35967.24s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[09:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35976.24s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[09:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35983.24s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[09:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35986.24s)]
*  But what has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[09:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35990.24s)]
*  There might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, [[09:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=35994.24s)]
*  not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[10:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36001.24s)]
*  So what happens then? Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[10:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36006.24s)]
*  Then they're addicted. Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[10:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36012.24s)]
*  We have to reverse the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[10:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36016.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[10:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36023.24s)]
*  We need a change. And that's why we're here offering that change. [[10:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36030.24s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, [[10:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36034.24s)]
*  the life that we used to take for granted. [[10:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36039.24s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, [[10:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36041.24s)]
*  where seniors can walk without fear for a change, where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, [[10:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36047.24s)]
*  where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[10:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36055.24s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, [[10:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36064.24s)]
*  the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[10:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36072.24s)]
*  We need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[10:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36075.24s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[10:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36081.24s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[10:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36087.24s)]
*  We're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again. [[10:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36092.24s)]
*  They are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[10:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36098.24s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer-funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers [[10:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36103.24s)]
*  filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[10:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36109.24s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence-based treatments [[10:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36113.24s)]
*  so we can bring our loved ones home drug-free for a change. [[10:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36119.24s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[10:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36123.24s)]
*  Put law-abiding Canadians first for a change. [[10:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36127.24s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[10:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36131.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. Let's bring it home. [[10:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36135.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36137.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36139.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36141.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36143.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36145.24s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call-in question from the phone line. [[10:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36147.24s)]
*  Thank you, guys. Thank you. [[10:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36152.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36156.24s)]
*  And your first question comes from the line for Renee Pierre-Fontaine. [[10:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36158.24s)]
*  So I'm turning it to Lenore. Please go ahead. [[10:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36161.24s)]
*  Bonjour. [[10:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36167.24s)]
*  Bonjour, Monsieur Poilier. [[10:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36177.24s)]
*  Dans un contexte où l'État refuse de verser sa juste part d'impôt au Canada [[10:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36179.24s)]
*  et bloque l'accès au contenu de nos médias, [[10:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36183.24s)]
*  les partis politiques ont quand même acheté des milliers de dollars en pub sur leur plateforme [[10:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36186.24s)]
*  plutôt que de soutenir nos médias locaux. [[10:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36190.24s)]
*  Donc c'est quoi la position du dé-conservateur face à la loi C-18 [[10:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36193.24s)]
*  qui force les entreprises numériques américaines à indemniser les médias canadiens pour partager leur contenu? [[10:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36197.24s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. Une bonne question. [[10:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36204.24s)]
*  Après la décennie perdue des libéraux, [[10:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36207.24s)]
*  on peut même pas avoir l'accès aux articles médiatiques sur Facebook et l'Instagram. [[10:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36209.24s)]
*  Les politiques de censure des libéraux a tué beaucoup de médias, réduit le nombre des médias. [[10:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36217.24s)]
*  Les médias indépendants sont bloqués maintenant de partager leur histoire. [[10:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36224.24s)]
*  Peut-être que c'est ça que les libéraux veulent après savoir gonfler l'inflation, [[10:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36229.24s)]
*  le coût du logement, la criminalité d'un heureux. [[10:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36236.24s)]
*  Les libéraux veulent moins des médias. Ils veulent contrôler tout. [[10:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36239.24s)]
*  On peut pas permettre un quatrième mandat libéral de l'inflation, [[10:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36243.24s)]
*  de l'inflation immobilière, de criminalité hors de contrôle. [[10:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36249.24s)]
*  Il nous faut que ça change. [[10:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36255.24s)]
*  Avec un nouveau gouvernement conservateur qui va permettre aux médias [[10:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36257.24s)]
*  de partager leur information aux réseaux sociaux, y compris sur la question d'abordabilité. [[10:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36262.24s)]
*  Nous allons faire changement avec des maisons abordables, l'épicerie abordable, les rues sécuritaires. [[10:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36272.24s)]
*  C'est ça le choix dans les élections. [[10:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36280.24s)]
*  Après une décennie libérale, le coût et la criminalité qui augmentent, [[10:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36282.24s)]
*  est-ce qu'on peut permettre un quatrième mandat? [[10:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36287.24s)]
*  Où est-ce qu'il faut que ça change pour vous donner une belle vie abordable dans les communautés sécuritaires? [[10:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36289.24s)]
*  Merci beaucoup. [[10:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36295.24s)]
*  In English, please. [[10:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36296.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36297.24s)]
*  Yes, look, a great question. [[10:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36298.24s)]
*  It was about how after the lost liberal decade, [[10:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36301.24s)]
*  many media outlets cannot actually share their information on Facebook and Instagram. [[10:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36306.24s)]
*  This has really attacked our local independent media. [[10:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36312.24s)]
*  And maybe that's the goal with out of control inflation, rising housing costs, crime and chaos in our streets. [[10:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36317.24s)]
*  Liberals are trying to get a fourth term by shutting out that information. [[10:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36325.24s)]
*  Their entire campaign is based on making you forget what happened over the last 10 years of liberal government [[10:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36329.24s)]
*  and forget what will happen in the next 15 years if you read this report that was just leaked out [[10:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36337.24s)]
*  that says that Canadians will be forced to forage on public lands for food if things continue on the current liberal track. [[10:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36346.24s)]
*  So it's not surprising that liberals would want to shut out discussion on that. [[10:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36355.24s)]
*  But a fourth liberal term is not the answer. [[10:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36360.24s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change, change so you can afford food and homes, [[10:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36364.24s)]
*  change so there's safety in your streets, change so that we have freedom of expression. [[10:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36371.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36375.24s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[10:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36377.24s)]
*  Hi, Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[10:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36382.24s)]
*  Sorry, I can't. [[10:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36384.24s)]
*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[10:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36385.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36386.24s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[10:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36387.24s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[10:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36389.24s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets that depend so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[10:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36394.24s)]
*  I can commit to that. [[10:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36404.24s)]
*  I said that in my platform you can see it there that we're going to back local independent journalism, including the local, the local journalism initiative. [[10:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36406.24s)]
*  And we're also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[10:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36416.24s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favored media outlets. [[10:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36422.24s)]
*  And, you know, the liberals want censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. [[10:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36428.24s)]
*  But that's exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[10:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36443.24s)]
*  It's not just local media that are suffering under the liberals. [[10:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36447.24s)]
*  It's everybody. [[10:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36451.24s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steel workers here in Hamilton. [[10:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36452.24s)]
*  Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. [[10:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36457.24s)]
*  But we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget about the last 10 years by limiting debate and distracting. [[10:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36460.24s)]
*  And we're not, they also want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the liberal policies remain in place. [[10:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36474.24s)]
*  We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. [[10:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36480.24s)]
*  We need to change. [[10:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36488.24s)]
*  This election really comes down to one word. [[10:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36489.24s)]
*  It's change. Change, change, change. [[10:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36491.24s)]
*  Change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change so that you are safe in your street. [[10:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36494.24s)]
*  This election is about change. [[10:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36500.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36502.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36503.24s)]
*  Next question. [[10:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36504.24s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. [[10:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36511.24s)]
*  My question is the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[10:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36516.24s)]
*  One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, particularly given, you know, some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops. [[10:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36521.24s)]
*  You know, he pulled first. [[10:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36533.24s)]
*  And but what's the kid doing with the gun? [[10:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36536.24s)]
*  You know, if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? [[10:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36538.24s)]
*  What do you think should be done with the young offender issue? [[10:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36543.24s)]
*  There do need to be. [[10:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36548.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for your question and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. [[10:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36550.24s)]
*  You know, our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever before. [[10:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36566.24s)]
*  Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. [[10:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36574.24s)]
*  There's drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders. [[10:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36577.24s)]
*  And there's more poverty. [[10:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36583.24s)]
*  Twenty five percent of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[10:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36586.24s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. [[10:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36590.24s)]
*  And I think if we elect liberals to a fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. [[10:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36594.24s)]
*  More crime, more danger, more inflation, more malnutrition. [[10:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36599.24s)]
*  But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. [[10:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36605.24s)]
*  We need a change, a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars from going through our ports and across our frontiers. [[10:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36607.24s)]
*  We need to give young people a sense of hope and opportunity again. [[10:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36619.24s)]
*  I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how many young people are involved. [[10:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36624.24s)]
*  And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. [[10:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36630.24s)]
*  Well, why is it? [[10:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36634.24s)]
*  Because we were giving young people hope, hope that they're going to have a better future. [[10:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36635.24s)]
*  Real hope for a change. [[10:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36641.24s)]
*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. [[10:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36649.24s)]
*  A job where they can excel, a business that they can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[10:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36656.24s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. [[10:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36670.24s)]
*  I call it the Canadian promise. [[10:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36673.24s)]
*  Let's bring it home for a change. [[10:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36675.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36676.24s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[10:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36681.24s)]
*  Hi, Mr. [[10:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36685.24s)]
*  Poliev, Trey Esri, Global News. [[10:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36686.24s)]
*  Canada could be headed into a recession, yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[10:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36688.24s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[10:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36694.24s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[10:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36697.24s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[10:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36703.24s)]
*  So I just wonder, should you have erred more on the side of caution, given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[10:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36714.24s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[10:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36721.24s)]
*  They are the reckless ones. [[10:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36734.24s)]
*  And now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty. [[10:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36736.24s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[10:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36741.24s)]
*  Now, you asked me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[10:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36758.24s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[10:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36771.24s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[10:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36776.24s)]
*  Of course it's... [[10:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36778.24s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[10:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36786.24s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[10:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36790.24s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[10:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36793.24s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere, Algoma and Everaz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[10:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36796.24s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[10:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36810.24s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[10:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36813.24s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[10:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36831.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36840.24s)]
*  Thank you everyone. [[10:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36841.24s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[10:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36842.24s)]
*  Ça conclut la conférence de presse. [[10:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36843.24s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. [[10:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36845.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36849.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36871.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36901.24s)]
*  Amazing. [[10:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36924.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36929.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[10:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36930.24s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[10:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36936.24s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word, change. [[10:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36939.24s)]
*  Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. [[10:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36946.24s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. [[10:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36956.24s)]
*  Change that you are safe on your streets. [[10:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36959.24s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[10:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36962.24s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[10:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36966.24s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[10:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36968.24s)]
*  The election is coming and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[10:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36976.24s)]
*  Change. Change for an affordable life, for food. [[10:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36985.24s)]
*  And affordable housing. [[10:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36990.24s)]
*  Change for a safe life. [[10:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36993.24s)]
*  Change for real. [[10:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36995.24s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[10:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36997.24s)]
*  After 10 long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[10:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=36999.24s)]
*  It has to change and it is only the Conservatives who will change things. [[10:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37013.24s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[10:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37017.24s)]
*  Ned Couric in Hamilton East, Zony Creek. [[10:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37021.24s)]
*  Dan Muse, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Grant North. [[10:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37024.24s)]
*  Erica Alexander. [[10:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37042.24s)]
*  Give her a round of applause. [[10:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37044.24s)]
*  She of course is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[10:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37045.24s)]
*  Ken Hewitt. [[10:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37075.24s)]
*  Hayden Lawrence. [[10:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37076.24s)]
*  Emily Brown. [[10:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37077.24s)]
*  Ron Chinser. [[10:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37078.24s)]
*  Give them all a round of applause. [[10:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37079.24s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[10:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37086.24s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. [[10:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37091.24s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[10:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37099.24s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people. [[10:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37117.24s)]
*  The police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[10:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37121.24s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[10:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37128.24s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[10:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37133.24s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. [[10:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37141.24s)]
*  Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[10:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37144.24s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[10:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37151.24s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[10:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37174.24s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[10:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37185.24s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[10:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37188.24s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, [[10:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37195.24s)]
*  Oh, we've got a little cough there. [[10:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37201.24s)]
*  We're okay? [[10:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37205.24s)]
*  All right. [[10:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37206.24s)]
*  All right. [[10:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37207.24s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[10:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37208.24s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[10:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37221.24s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[10:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37229.24s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[10:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37232.24s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[10:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37235.24s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. [[10:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37239.24s)]
*  And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[10:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37240.24s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[10:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37247.24s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[10:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37258.24s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[10:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37262.24s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[10:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37265.24s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. [[10:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37276.24s)]
*  So why would he presume to change anything? [[10:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37278.24s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[10:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37281.24s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[10:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37283.24s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[10:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37294.24s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[10:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37309.24s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[10:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37312.24s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[10:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37316.24s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[10:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37320.24s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[10:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37323.24s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[10:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37330.24s)]
*  Now add it all up. [[10:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37341.24s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[10:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37344.24s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[10:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37352.24s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, to pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[10:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37353.24s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[10:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37358.24s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[10:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37363.24s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[10:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37367.24s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[10:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37370.24s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[10:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37378.24s)]
*  Now this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[10:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37385.24s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[10:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37392.24s)]
*  That was then. This is now. [[10:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37394.24s)]
*  The past is the past. [[10:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37395.24s)]
*  Forget about it. [[10:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37396.24s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[10:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37397.24s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[10:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37400.24s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[10:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37403.24s)]
*  You know, it would be nice. [[10:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37405.24s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[10:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37407.24s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[10:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37412.24s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[10:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37415.24s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[10:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37418.24s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[10:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37423.24s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[10:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37428.24s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[10:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37432.24s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[10:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37434.24s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[10:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37443.24s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[10:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37451.24s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social, economic and political conflict. [[10:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37454.24s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[10:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37463.24s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[10:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37469.24s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[10:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37477.24s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[10:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37484.24s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[10:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37490.24s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[10:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37507.24s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[10:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37514.24s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout, The Last of Us. [[10:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37519.24s)]
*  But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[10:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37527.24s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. [[10:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37531.24s)]
*  It's for 15 years from now. [[10:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37533.24s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? [[10:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37535.24s)]
*  No, that is not change. [[10:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37537.24s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[10:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37540.24s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[10:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37543.24s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[10:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37546.24s)]
*  He might look different. [[10:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37552.24s)]
*  He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[10:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37554.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn. [[10:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37558.24s)]
*  After 10 years of liberal government, predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[10:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37561.24s)]
*  It's funny, yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[10:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37570.24s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[10:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37579.24s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[10:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37582.24s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[10:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37589.24s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[10:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37596.24s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's, or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so the Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[10:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37599.24s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[10:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37617.24s)]
*  That's a good choice. [[10:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37623.24s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[10:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37629.24s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[10:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37635.24s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal liberal drug crime, drug criminal justice, border and other policies, violent crime is up 15% gun crime up a shocking 116% extortion and auto theft up 357% and 46% respectively. [[10:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37646.24s)]
*  And you're, you are the ones facing it on the front lines the police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd they're the ones facing it here in Hamilton, innocent young woman was killed, waiting for the bus to go to work, just the other day. [[10:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37673.24s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car, but missed and hit her instead. [[10:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37690.24s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk Mohawk College, with her whole life ahead of her. [[10:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37698.24s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[10:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37704.24s)]
*  Also this week the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla. [[10:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37707.24s)]
*  Just three years ago. [[10:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37716.24s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a real heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him, a loving son and brother, whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[10:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37718.24s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record, a mile long, and is so often the case. He was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[10:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37731.24s)]
*  Imagine where we would be today, imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[10:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37746.24s)]
*  Imagine if Conservative three strikes throughout laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[10:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37755.24s)]
*  What would have happened? And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[10:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37763.24s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, which requires judges release offenders under, quote, [[10:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37767.24s)]
*  the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity, a law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[10:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37783.24s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, watching Netflix, able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[10:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37792.24s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[10:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37803.24s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[10:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37812.24s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[10:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37816.24s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[10:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37830.24s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. It was incredible. [[10:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37847.24s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[10:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37851.24s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. Is this how we keep people safe? [[10:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37863.24s)]
*  We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[10:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37869.24s)]
*  This is insanity. But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[10:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37873.24s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path is the horrible homeless encampments. [[10:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37879.24s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[10:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37892.24s)]
*  It is unimaginable. It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[10:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37899.24s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[10:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37904.24s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time it's interesting. [[10:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37913.24s)]
*  Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. And what has happened? Homelessness has gone up by 20%. [[10:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37919.24s)]
*  Chronic homelessness up 38%. That is the legacy of this liberal government. [[10:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37926.24s)]
*  The liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. Instead, it went through the roof. [[10:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37932.24s)]
*  And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth liberal term. [[10:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37937.24s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[10:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37942.24s)]
*  Our public encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[10:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37947.24s)]
*  Our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[10:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37952.24s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[10:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37959.24s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[10:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37962.24s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, [[10:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37966.24s)]
*  they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[10:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37971.24s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl. [[10:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37976.24s)]
*  Twisted, their spinal cords twisted from countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense [[10:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37983.24s)]
*  because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[10:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37993.24s)]
*  And the liberals just say, let it continue. [[10:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=37999.24s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, [[10:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38002.24s)]
*  keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[10:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38008.24s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last liberal decade has brought us. [[10:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38017.24s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain [[10:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38023.24s)]
*  and of course, rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[10:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38029.24s)]
*  The liberals had promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[10:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38035.24s)]
*  They rather abandoned vulnerable people and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[10:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38039.24s)]
*  Camps now invade the places where children used to play and where families gathered in all sections of the country. [[10:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38046.24s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[10:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38058.24s)]
*  The businesses around the parks have been condemned. [[10:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38069.24s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children go through the parks to go to school. [[10:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38073.24s)]
*  And those who are prisoners in these camps, our brothers, sisters, and neighbours, are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of a overdose alone. [[10:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38081.24s)]
*  This is not compassion. [[10:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38095.24s)]
*  It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the liberals. [[10:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38097.24s)]
*  Let me be clear, letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[10:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38104.24s)]
*  It is chaos. [[10:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38110.24s)]
*  And it is the direct result of liberals pro drug agenda policies that have legalized hard drugs, pump toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply and then left the victims with no other options. [[10:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38112.24s)]
*  No, nothing for treatment, nothing for recovery, no attempt to actually get people off drugs and no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[10:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38126.24s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[10:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38146.24s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[10:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38152.24s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[10:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38165.24s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[10:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38170.24s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[10:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38177.24s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[10:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38185.24s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into from out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[10:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38188.24s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[10:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38197.24s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[10:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38201.24s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[10:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38209.24s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[10:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38211.24s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[10:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38224.24s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[10:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38229.24s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[10:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38232.24s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[10:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38238.24s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[10:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38243.24s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[10:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38247.24s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[10:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38254.24s)]
*  We'll offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[10:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38256.24s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges. [[10:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38263.24s)]
*  But we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places. [[10:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38267.24s)]
*  We will give them a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[10:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38275.24s)]
*  So we're not here to give people a way out. [[10:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38280.24s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[10:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38284.24s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, [[10:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38301.24s)]
*  we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[10:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38318.24s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[10:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38323.24s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit, they pass drug tests again and again and again, [[10:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38332.24s)]
*  then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[10:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38343.24s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[10:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38350.24s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[10:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38353.24s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. [[10:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38356.24s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[10:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38361.24s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[10:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38366.24s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. [[10:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38372.24s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger [[10:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38374.24s)]
*  and release public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[10:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38386.24s)]
*  Finish the apologies by politicians. [[10:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38394.24s)]
*  Secondly, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[10:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38397.24s)]
*  That means not only a roof, but also real support, including treatment, mental health services, and professional training, [[10:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38408.24s)]
*  so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[10:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38419.24s)]
*  Thirdly, if needed, occupants will be subject to criminal proceedings, [[10:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38428.24s)]
*  but we're going to give the judge the power to order the people accused of illegal occupation in public spaces for the simple drug and the sites. [[10:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38434.24s)]
*  We're going to give the judge the option to order treatment against drugs. [[10:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38446.24s)]
*  And for the most serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, [[10:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38451.24s)]
*  we're going to give the judge more power to order treatment and common-law tests inside prisons [[10:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38458.24s)]
*  to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[10:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38466.24s)]
*  That way, we're going to bring back hope for change, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[10:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38473.24s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will replace it with hope for a better future, for change. [[10:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38484.24s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[10:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38492.24s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[10:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38496.24s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land, and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[10:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38508.24s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[10:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38517.24s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[10:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38522.24s)]
*  But what has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[10:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38526.24s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 years in the city, and they're going to be able to afford a place to live. [[10:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38530.24s)]
*  They might be able to afford a place to live. [[10:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38536.24s)]
*  They might be able to afford a place to live. [[10:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38538.24s)]
*  They might be able to afford a place to live. [[10:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38540.24s)]
*  There's absolutely no hope for them. [[10:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38542.24s)]
*  They might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment, never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[10:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38544.24s)]
*  So what happens then? [[10:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38556.24s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[10:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38557.24s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[10:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38562.24s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[10:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38563.24s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[10:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38565.24s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[10:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38572.24s)]
*  We need a change. [[10:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38579.24s)]
*  And that's why we're here offering that change. [[10:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38581.24s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[10:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38583.24s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[10:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38586.24s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change. [[10:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38591.24s)]
*  Where families can raise their children safely for a change. [[10:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38594.24s)]
*  Where seniors can walk without fear for a change. [[10:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38597.24s)]
*  Where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change. [[10:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38600.24s)]
*  Where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[10:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38605.24s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals. [[10:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38614.24s)]
*  With the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors, we need a new conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[10:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38620.24s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns. [[10:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38630.24s)]
*  Ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[10:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38633.24s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[10:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38636.24s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, they are mass murderers and they will be treated like a criminal. [[10:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38640.24s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centers filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[10:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38649.24s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence-based treatment so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[10:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38661.24s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[10:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38671.24s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. [[10:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38676.24s)]
*  That is how we bring hope for a change. [[10:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38680.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38683.24s)]
*  Let's bring it home. [[10:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38684.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38685.24s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[10:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38696.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38701.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38702.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38706.24s)]
*  And your first question comes from the line for Nathia Fontaine from Toronto. [[10:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38707.24s)]
*  The order is still ahead. [[10:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38711.24s)]

*  Chris Arnold with Village Media. [[10:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38935.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38936.54s)]
*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. You had said previously that your [[10:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38937.54s)]
*  government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. I'm wondering [[10:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38940.54s)]
*  if you can commit to not cut funding for local media and local news outlets. That depends [[10:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38944.54s)]
*  so much on grants from the government, subsidies from the government. [[10:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38950.94s)]
*  I can commit to that. I said that in my platform, you can see it there, that we're going to [[10:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38954.44s)]
*  back local independent journalism, including the local journalism initiative. And we're [[10:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38959.64s)]
*  also going to make sure that local media get their fair share of government advertising. [[10:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38966.64s)]
*  It shouldn't only go to the liberal government's favoured media outlets. The liberals want [[10:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38972.64s)]
*  censorship to silence people about the doubling of housing costs, the insane rise of food [[10:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38980.64s)]
*  prices, the crime and chaos liberals have unleashed in our communities. But that's [[10:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38988.64s)]
*  exactly why we can't afford a fourth liberal term. It's not just local media that are suffering [[10:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=38994.64s)]
*  under the liberals. It's everybody. It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steel [[10:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39000.64s)]
*  workers here in Hamilton that Mark Carney wants to hit with another carbon tax. But [[10:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39005.64s)]
*  we're not going to let them, you know, their entire strategy is to make Canadians forget [[10:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39011.64s)]
*  about the last ten years by limiting debate and distracting. And we're not, they also [[10:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39016.64s)]
*  want you to forget about the next 15 years if these, if the liberal policies remain in [[10:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39024.64s)]
*  place. We need strong independent media so that Canadians get all the information. We [[10:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39029.64s)]
*  need to change. This election really comes down to one word. It's change. Change, change, [[10:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39037.64s)]
*  change, change so you can afford food, change so you can afford homes, change so that you [[10:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39043.64s)]
*  are safe in your street. This election is about change. Thank you. [[10:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39048.64s)]
*  Thank you. Next question. [[10:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39053.64s)]
*  Hi, Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. My question is, the law and order has been a cornerstone [[10:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39055.64s)]
*  of your platform. One thing I haven't heard a whole lot of is about youthful offenders, [[10:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39069.64s)]
*  particularly given, you know, some 16-year-old kids in the morgue following a shootout with [[10:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39076.64s)]
*  Toronto cops, you know, he pulled first. But what's the kid doing with the gun? You know, [[10:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39081.64s)]
*  if he survived, was he only going to do 18 months? What do you think should be done with [[10:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39088.64s)]
*  the young offender issue? There do need to be, thank you very much for your question [[10:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39095.64s)]
*  and the story that you shared is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal [[10:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39101.64s)]
*  justice laws, weak borders and drugs on our streets. You know, our kids are now more vulnerable [[10:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39111.64s)]
*  to gang recruitment than ever before. Their parents are stressed out and exhausted. There's [[10:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39119.64s)]
*  drugs and guns everywhere in our streets that have come in through the poorest borders and [[10:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39127.64s)]
*  there's more poverty. 25% of our people live in poverty after the lost liberal decade. [[10:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39134.64s)]
*  So our youth have never been so vulnerable. And I think if we elect the liberals to a [[10:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39140.64s)]
*  fourth liberal term, it's going to be even worse for our young people. More crime, more danger, [[10:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39146.64s)]
*  more inflation, more malnutrition. But we can't afford a fourth liberal term. We need a change, [[10:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39151.64s)]
*  a change to lock up the criminals, secure the borders, stop the drugs, guns and stolen cars [[10:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39158.64s)]
*  from going through our ports and across our frontiers. We need to give young people a sense [[10:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39164.64s)]
*  of hope and opportunity again. I think one of the things I've noticed about my campaign is how [[10:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39172.64s)]
*  many young people are involved. And it wasn't always the case for conservatives. Well, why is it? [[10:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39178.64s)]
*  Because we're giving young people hope. Hope that they're going to have a better future. [[10:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39184.64s)]
*  Real hope for a change. I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime [[10:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39191.64s)]
*  knowing that there's something so much better we have in store for them. A job where they can excel. [[10:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39201.64s)]
*  A business that they can start. A community where they will thrive and succeed. [[10:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39207.64s)]
*  A nice home where they'll raise families in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. [[10:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39214.64s)]
*  That is the beautiful future that we have. I call it the Canadian promise. Let's bring it home for a change. [[10:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39220.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[10:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39225.64s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[10:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39227.64s)]
*  Hi Mr. Poliev. Canada could be headed into a recession yet your platform does not account for this uncertainty. [[10:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39232.64s)]
*  How do you justify that? [[10:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39243.64s)]
*  Well, my platform, when you say it doesn't account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? [[10:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39245.64s)]
*  Well, part of your platform projects growth based on projects that have yet to happen by repealing C-69, [[10:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39252.64s)]
*  by having growth with pipelines that could take years. [[10:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39260.64s)]
*  So I just wonder should you have erred more on the side of caution given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? [[10:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39263.64s)]
*  Well, listen, first of all, the reason our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years [[10:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39270.64s)]
*  is because of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. [[10:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39277.64s)]
*  They are the reckless ones and now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is in a period of uncertainty, [[10:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39283.64s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned [[10:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39290.64s)]
*  and then stack $130 billion more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion dollars of extra inflationary debt [[10:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39295.64s)]
*  that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. [[10:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39305.64s)]
*  Now, you ask me in a period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, [[10:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39308.64s)]
*  whether it is wise to campaign on economic growth? [[10:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39315.64s)]
*  It's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our economy. [[10:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39321.64s)]
*  We need to unleash... [[10:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39326.64s)]
*  Of course it's... [[10:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39329.64s)]
*  What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. [[10:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39336.64s)]
*  Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[10:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39340.64s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. [[10:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39343.64s)]
*  He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, [[10:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39346.64s)]
*  elsewhere Algoma and Everaz to shut down our steel industry with taxes. [[10:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39353.64s)]
*  That is more Liberal recklessness. [[10:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39359.64s)]
*  What is actually responsible is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law, [[10:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39362.64s)]
*  C-69, getting rid of the Liberal energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, [[10:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39369.64s)]
*  incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. [[10:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39377.64s)]
*  All of these projects will put our people to work with powerful paychecks that buy them affordable food and homes for a change. [[10:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39380.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[10:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39389.64s)]
*  Thank you everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[10:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39390.64s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. Thank you. [[10:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39393.64s)]

*  Thank you. [[10:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39478.64s)]
*  Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. [[10:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39479.64s)]
*  It's great to be here in the Hammer. [[10:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39485.64s)]
*  Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday, and it comes down to one word. [[10:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39488.64s)]
*  Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. [[10:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39494.64s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. Change that you are safe on your streets. [[10:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39500.64s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. [[10:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39510.64s)]
*  Change to put Canada first. [[10:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39514.64s)]
*  And change is the name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, for a change. [[10:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39516.64s)]
*  The election is coming, and there is one key word that will decide this election. [[10:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39525.64s)]
*  Change. Change for an affordable life, for food and housing. Change for a safe life, change for real. [[10:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39534.64s)]
*  That is the choice for Canadians. [[10:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39546.64s)]
*  After ten long years, a decade lost to the Liberals with prices that have gone up, the immigration system out of control. [[10:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39548.64s)]
*  It has to change, and it is only the Conservatives who will change things. [[10:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39562.64s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. [[10:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39566.64s)]
*  Ned Couric in Hamilton East, Zoney Creek. [[10:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39570.64s)]
*  Dan Muse, Flambrough, Grand North. [[10:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39582.64s)]
*  Erica Alexander. Give her a round of applause. [[10:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39591.64s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great Conservative, a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[10:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39594.64s)]
*  Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. Give them all a round of applause. [[11:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39617.64s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[11:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39630.64s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, but it's official. [[11:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39640.64s)]
*  The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[11:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39648.64s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing that they may not return. [[11:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39658.64s)]
*  They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[11:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39677.64s)]
*  Yesterday, I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[11:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39682.64s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. Change means unleashing our resources so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[11:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39690.64s)]
*  Over the next four years, my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[11:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39700.64s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[11:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39728.64s)]
*  This is not a figure of speech. [[11:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39735.64s)]
*  The platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau. [[11:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39738.64s)]
*  And then when they switched him out and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh, we've got a little cough there. [[11:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39744.64s)]
*  We're okay? All right. All right. [[11:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39754.64s)]
*  I think he was reacting to the deficit in Mark Carney's platform. [[11:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39757.64s)]
*  You know, I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and little baby cruise and he wasn't crying. [[11:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39769.64s)]
*  And of course, that's every parent's worst nightmare. [[11:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39778.64s)]
*  And then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear. [[11:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39780.64s)]
*  And all of a sudden, a great cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay. [[11:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39784.64s)]
*  So we held him in our arms. And afterwards, I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor, what did you tell our little infant to make him cry ever so much? [[11:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39788.64s)]
*  He said, well, I just told him that his share of the national debt was $90,000. [[11:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39796.64s)]
*  But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. [[11:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39807.64s)]
*  You know, they took this platform, they wrote it for Trudeau. [[11:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39811.64s)]
*  And then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write his own plan because he has his plan has been carried out over the last five years. [[11:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39814.64s)]
*  While he was Trudeau's economic adviser. So why would he presume to change anything? [[11:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39825.64s)]
*  Well, there is one thing he changed. [[11:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39830.64s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would add $130 billion more. [[11:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39832.64s)]
*  When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and housing prices even more. [[11:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39843.64s)]
*  In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. [[11:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39858.64s)]
*  The truth is he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. [[11:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39861.64s)]
*  He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[11:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39865.64s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. [[11:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39869.64s)]
*  Liberal economist Trevor Toome said that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible. [[11:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39872.64s)]
*  And Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out, not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be reelected for a fourth liberal term. [[11:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39879.64s)]
*  Now, add it all up. [[11:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39890.64s)]
*  Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter trillion dollars more inflationary debt? [[11:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39893.64s)]
*  Can you afford that? [[11:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39901.64s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, to pay for it all, he would have to raise taxes. [[11:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39902.64s)]
*  There's no question he would reinstate the tax increases Trudeau had planned. [[11:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39907.64s)]
*  He would raise other taxes only on others, not on him. [[11:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39912.64s)]
*  He would stash his cash in overseas tax havens. [[11:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39916.64s)]
*  But over the last lost liberal decade, Canada is heading in the wrong direction and fast. [[11:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39919.64s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, the Liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. [[11:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39927.64s)]
*  Now, this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last 10 years of Liberal government. [[11:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39934.64s)]
*  Pretend it didn't happen. [[11:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39941.64s)]
*  That was then. This is now. [[11:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39943.64s)]
*  The past is the past. [[11:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39944.64s)]
*  Forget about it. [[11:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39945.64s)]
*  Well, what does the future look like? [[11:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39946.64s)]
*  Not according to me, but according to them. [[11:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39949.64s)]
*  Well, they published this report. [[11:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39952.64s)]
*  You know, it would be nice. [[11:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39954.64s)]
*  Frankly, this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada before the election. [[11:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39956.64s)]
*  Future lives, social mobility in question. [[11:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39961.64s)]
*  This is the government of Canada's own report. [[11:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39964.64s)]
*  If I had alleged the things in this report, the media would be attacking me as outlandish. [[11:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39967.64s)]
*  But this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory. [[11:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39972.64s)]
*  And I will emphasize that this is their own words. [[11:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39977.64s)]
*  This is what they have to say. [[11:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39982.64s)]
*  I say that many times just so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be you would find it hard to believe the things that they say. [[11:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39984.64s)]
*  The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to afford rent bills and groceries on housing. [[11:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=39993.64s)]
*  In 2040, owning a home is not a realistic goal for many. [[11:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40000.64s)]
*  And inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, a key driver of social economic and political conflict. [[11:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40003.64s)]
*  The report paints a terrifying picture of national spiral of depression and decline. [[11:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40012.64s)]
*  It forecasts widespread mental health crises, quote, if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. [[11:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40018.64s)]
*  If young workers leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number of older people. [[11:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40026.64s)]
*  It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether. [[11:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40033.64s)]
*  And this the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path that people may have to start, quote, hunt, hunt, might have to start hunt fish and forage on public lands and waterways. [[11:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40039.64s)]
*  You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go into a grocery store anymore. [[11:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40055.64s)]
*  And they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to scrape out an existence. [[11:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40062.64s)]
*  This sounds incredible, like something from a post apocalyptic television television series like the fallout. [[11:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40067.64s)]
*  The last of us. But this is not that it is a liberal government forecast. [[11:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40074.64s)]
*  And it's not for 100 years from now. It's for 15 years from now. [[11:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40079.64s)]
*  Is that the future that you want for your kids? No, that is not change. [[11:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40083.64s)]
*  That is more of the inflationary spiral. [[11:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40089.64s)]
*  The liberals have brought us over the last decade. [[11:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40092.64s)]
*  And Mark Carney will continue with every single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. [[11:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40095.64s)]
*  They might he might look different. He might use more different buzzwords, but it is exactly the same liberal agenda. [[11:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40101.64s)]
*  We cannot afford a fourth liberal turn after 10 years of liberal government. [[11:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40107.64s)]
*  Predictions about housing shortages, mental health crises and a loss of hope for many Canadians is already the reality. [[11:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40112.64s)]
*  It's funny. Yesterday a CBC post was saying, well, are all of these terrible things in this government report really realistic? [[11:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40119.64s)]
*  Could they really happen in 15 years? [[11:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40128.64s)]
*  And to her credit, another journalist said, well, for a lot of Canadians, that's the way it is now. [[11:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40131.64s)]
*  That's how desperate the situation has already become after 10 years of liberal government. [[11:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40138.64s)]
*  So the choice of this election cannot be clearer. [[11:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40145.64s)]
*  A fourth term liberal term with Mark Carney, whose plan is even more reckless and costly than Justin Trudeau's or a new conservative government that will cut waste and bureaucracy, [[11:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40148.64s)]
*  bring down taxes, unleash home building and resource development so that Canadians can afford a good life on a safe street. [[11:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40159.64s)]
*  That's the choice before us today. [[11:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40166.64s)]
*  Nothing has become a more profound symbol of the lost liberal decade. [[11:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40178.64s)]
*  Nothing more than the homeless encampments that were unheard of before this government took office, but have now become a part of everyday life. [[11:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40184.64s)]
*  The crime that is associated with them, the violence and the fear that is now overtaking our streets because of liberal, liberal drug, crime, drug, criminal justice, border and other policies. [[11:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40195.64s)]
*  Violent crime is up 15 percent. Gun crime up a shocking 116 percent. [[11:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40210.64s)]
*  Extortion and auto theft up 357 percent and 46 46 percent respectively. [[11:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40215.64s)]
*  And you're you are the ones facing it on the front lines. [[11:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40222.64s)]
*  The police officers here with me today and there are many police officers in this crowd. [[11:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40226.64s)]
*  They're the ones facing it here in Hamilton. [[11:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40230.64s)]
*  An innocent young woman was killed waiting for the bus to go to work just the other day. [[11:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40233.64s)]
*  The shot was apparently fired from a passing SUV at another car but missed and hit her instead. [[11:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40239.64s)]
*  She was a student studying at Mohawk College with her whole life ahead of her. [[11:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40247.64s)]
*  It was a shocking and senseless tragedy. [[11:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40253.64s)]
*  Also this week, the court is hearing closing arguments in the case of two individuals charged with shooting OPP Constable Greg Piershalla just three years ago. [[11:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40256.64s)]
*  Again, he was a young man, a heroic young man with his entire life ahead of him. [[11:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40267.64s)]
*  A loving son and brother whose loss has left his family and law enforcement with holes in their hearts. [[11:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40273.64s)]
*  Randall Mackenzie, one of the accused, had a criminal record a mile long and is so often the case he was out on bail for one violent offense when he allegedly committed this crime. [[11:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40280.64s)]
*  Imagine how imagine where we would be today. [[11:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40295.64s)]
*  Imagine where Mr. Piershalla's family would be today if he had not been released on bail. [[11:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40298.64s)]
*  Imagine if conservative three strikes your out laws were actually in place and he had been locked away. [[11:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40304.64s)]
*  What would have happened? [[11:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40311.64s)]
*  And more importantly, what would not have happened? [[11:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40313.64s)]
*  Sadly, these kinds of tragedies have become all too common in recent years. [[11:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40315.64s)]
*  For the last 10 years, the Liberal government has unleashed this crime with lax laws like C-75, [[11:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40319.64s)]
*  which requires judges release offenders under quote the least onerous conditions at the earliest opportunity, [[11:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40327.64s)]
*  a law that Mark Carney has pledged, a liberal law that Mark Carney has pledged to keep in place. [[11:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40336.64s)]
*  Liberals brought in house arrest, C-5, which allows repeat offenders to do their sentences in their living rooms, [[11:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40341.64s)]
*  watching Netflix able to walk out the door at any time to re-offend. [[11:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40347.64s)]
*  And instead of promising to work with law enforcement to end the crime and chaos, [[11:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40352.64s)]
*  Mark Carney has pledged to keep the liberal policies in place. [[11:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40357.64s)]
*  He wants to ban hunting rifles rather than banning gun criminals. [[11:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40361.64s)]
*  As Prime Minister, I'll listen to law enforcement and work with them so that together we can reverse the dangerous liberal crime wave of the last decade [[11:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40365.64s)]
*  and bring home safe streets for a change, for a change, for a change. [[11:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40374.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40382.64s)]
*  Safe streets used to be something we took for granted. [[11:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40389.64s)]
*  People in Canada, in many communities, it's hard to believe this now, used to leave their doors unlocked. [[11:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40391.64s)]
*  They had to sleep with their doors unlocked. It was incredible. [[11:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40396.64s)]
*  And now we have a situation where the Toronto Chief of Police has to tell Torontonians, [[11:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40400.64s)]
*  leave your car keys next to the front door so that if someone wants to steal your vehicle, they can safely do it. [[11:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40405.64s)]
*  You can just come in and take the keys and leave with the car without hurting anybody. [[11:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40412.64s)]
*  Is this how we keep people safe? We say give your car to the thief so that he doesn't shoot you or stab you? [[11:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40415.64s)]
*  This is insanity. But of course it is what life looks like after this lost liberal decade. [[11:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40422.64s)]
*  One of the most visible signs of this total meltdown that Liberals admit in their own reports is going to worsen on the current path [[11:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40429.64s)]
*  is the horrible homeless encampments. [[11:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40438.64s)]
*  In Ontario alone, after the lost liberal decade, there are 1,400 homeless encampments. [[11:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40441.64s)]
*  It is unimaginable. It's like something out of the Great Depression. [[11:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40448.64s)]
*  In Toronto, the number of homeless encampments more than doubled in just one year from 82 in 2023 to 200 today. [[11:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40453.64s)]
*  Homelessness is up 20% since 2018, roughly the time it's interesting. [[11:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40462.64s)]
*  Mark Carney became the economic adviser in 2020. [[11:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40468.64s)]
*  And what has happened? Homelessness has gone up by 20%. Chronic homelessness up 38%. [[11:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40471.64s)]
*  That is the legacy of this Liberal government. The Liberals promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[11:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40478.64s)]
*  Instead, it went through the roof. And now they expect you to believe their promises for a fourth time and a fourth Liberal term. [[11:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40485.64s)]
*  Instead, they've abandoned the vulnerable and condemned them to sidewalks and back alleys. [[11:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40491.64s)]
*  Encampments now fill spaces where children once played and families once gathered. [[11:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40496.64s)]
*  Our public spaces have become a breeding grounds for addiction, violence, human trafficking and crime. [[11:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40501.64s)]
*  Businesses around parks have been boarded up. [[11:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40508.64s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their kids cut through parks on their way to school. [[11:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40510.64s)]
*  And for those trapped in these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, our neighbours, [[11:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40515.64s)]
*  they are left to suffer in the cold, to overdose and sometimes to die alone. [[11:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40519.64s)]
*  These are places where half-dead contorted bodies lie on the ground on the verge of overdose from fentanyl. [[11:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40525.64s)]
*  Twisted, their spinal cords twisted for countless hours, hunched over in painful positions that they cannot sense [[11:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40532.64s)]
*  because of the immense power of the poison running through their bodies and their minds. [[11:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40542.64s)]
*  And the Liberals just say, let it continue. [[11:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40548.64s)]
*  In fact, their policy has been to supply even more drugs, more opioids, [[11:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40551.64s)]
*  keep the problem going and keep an entire apparatus of bureaucracy and interest groups employed, expanding this problem. [[11:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40557.64s)]
*  These homeless encampments are a symbol of everything this last Liberal decade has brought us. [[11:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40566.64s)]
*  Doubling housing costs, out of control food prices, which put people under economic strain [[11:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40572.64s)]
*  and of course rampant liberalization of drugs and crime, which allow the chaos to expand. [[11:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40578.64s)]
*  The Liberals had promised to eliminate chronic homelessness. [[11:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40584.64s)]
*  They rather abandoned vulnerable people and condemned them to live on the sidewalks and in the streets. [[11:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40588.64s)]
*  Camps had now invaded the places where children played before [[11:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40595.64s)]
*  and where families gathered in all safety. [[11:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40603.64s)]
*  Our public spaces have become areas that are vulnerable to drug addiction, violence, [[11:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40608.64s)]
*  human trafficking and crime. [[11:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40616.64s)]
*  The businesses around the parks have been condemned. [[11:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40619.64s)]
*  Parents are afraid to let their children go through the parks to go to school. [[11:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40623.64s)]
*  And those who are prisoners of these camps, our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors, [[11:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40630.64s)]
*  are left to themselves in the cold where they risk dying of overdose alone. [[11:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40637.64s)]
*  This is not compassion. [[11:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40644.64s)]
*  It is cruelty that people experience after ten long years of the Liberals. [[11:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40646.64s)]
*  Let me be clear. [[11:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40653.64s)]
*  Letting these tent cities spread is not compassion. [[11:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40654.64s)]
*  It is chaos. [[11:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40659.64s)]
*  And it is the direct result of Liberals' pro-drug agenda. [[11:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40661.64s)]
*  Policies that have legalized hard drugs, pumped toxic narcotics into our streets under the failed banner of safe supply [[11:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40665.64s)]
*  and then left the victims with no other options. [[11:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40672.64s)]
*  Nothing for treatment. [[11:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40675.64s)]
*  Nothing for recovery. [[11:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40677.64s)]
*  No attempt to actually get people off drugs. [[11:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40679.64s)]
*  And no change whatsoever to this policy proposed by Mark Carney, [[11:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40681.64s)]
*  who wants to continue the exact same policies that he advised Justin Trudeau over the last five years. [[11:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40688.64s)]
*  A new Conservative government will end the chaos and restore Canada's promise for a change. [[11:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40695.64s)]
*  Public spaces... [[11:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40701.64s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[11:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40709.64s)]
*  We will take back our streets and restore order in our communities. [[11:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40714.64s)]
*  And we will give people that are currently trapped in these awful circumstances a pathway to a better life. [[11:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40719.64s)]
*  A life with a home, with nutritious food, physical exercise, connections to family, a new chance to start over. [[11:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40726.64s)]
*  It's going to be a future of hope. [[11:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40734.64s)]
*  And the people who come out of these encampments into... [[11:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40737.64s)]
*  From out of the shadows, they will come into the light and enjoy the Canadian dream, the Canadian promise. [[11:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40740.64s)]
*  And they will have a superpower when they come from these backgrounds. [[11:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40746.64s)]
*  They will have a superpower that they have lived through the worst valleys and now they can appreciate the summit on which they will enjoy their lives. [[11:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40750.64s)]
*  So our plan is clear. [[11:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40758.64s)]
*  First, we will amend the criminal code to give police legal powers [[11:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40760.64s)]
*  so that they can remove individuals who are a danger to public safety and clear public spaces where access is currently blocked by tents and temporary shelters. [[11:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40764.64s)]
*  No more excuses by politicians claiming they don't have the powers. [[11:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40773.64s)]
*  The powers will be right there in the criminal code. [[11:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40778.64s)]
*  No more paralysis from politically correct liberal politicians who are too afraid to take action. [[11:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40781.64s)]
*  Second, we will provide addiction treatment to 50,000 Canadians. [[11:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40787.64s)]
*  We will return a true housing first model, get people into a home. [[11:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40792.64s)]
*  But if their addiction is the thing preventing them from succeeding in that home, we will get them into addiction treatment. [[11:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40796.64s)]
*  We will treat the problem. [[11:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40803.64s)]
*  We will offer mental health supports, job training so police can connect the people in these camps with the care and the housing they need. [[11:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40805.64s)]
*  Third, where appropriate, the occupants will face criminal charges, but... [[11:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40812.64s)]
*  But we will give judges the power to order the people charged for illegally occupying these public places a simple possession charge that requires they go into treatment. [[11:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40817.64s)]
*  So we're not here to... [[11:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40828.64s)]
*  We're here to give people a way out. [[11:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40830.64s)]
*  If someone is illegally occupying a public space, then we will allow judges to give them a sentence of drug treatment [[11:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40833.64s)]
*  that will get them off the poisons that condemned them to that homelessness in the first place. [[11:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40844.64s)]
*  And... [[11:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40849.64s)]
*  And for more serious criminals where addiction is a factor in their crime, but where their crime requires they do jail time, [[11:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40851.64s)]
*  we will allow judges to make mandatory treatment a part of their prison sentence. [[11:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40867.64s)]
*  And there will be regular drug tests for prisoners because we know that if someone comes out continually addicted to drugs, they're probably going to re-offend. [[11:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40872.64s)]
*  But if on the other hand, while they're in prison, they're given treatment, recovery services, and they show that they've hit... [[11:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40881.64s)]
*  They pass drug tests again and again and again, then their chance at rehabilitation and becoming a successful part of society is much higher. [[11:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40889.64s)]
*  That's how we're going to restore safe streets for a change. [[11:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40899.64s)]
*  That's how we'll bring back hope for a change. [[11:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40902.64s)]
*  A new Conservative government will put an end to chaos and will restore Canada's promise. [[11:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40905.64s)]
*  Public spaces must be safe for everyone. [[11:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40910.64s)]
*  We will regain control of our streets and restore order in our communities to make changes. [[11:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40915.64s)]
*  Here's how we're going to do it. [[11:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40921.64s)]
*  First, we're going to modify the criminal code to give the police clear legal powers so they can arrest people who put the public in danger [[11:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40923.64s)]
*  and release public spaces that are currently blocked by temporary tents and shelters. [[11:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40935.64s)]
*  We'll end the apologies by politicians. [[11:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40943.64s)]
*  Secondly, we're going to provide treatment against addiction to 50,000 Canadians and we're going to bring back a model that prioritizes housing. [[11:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40946.64s)]
*  That means not only a three-way, but also real support, including treatment, mental health services, and professional training [[11:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40957.64s)]
*  so that the police can put people who live in the camps in contact with the care and housing they need. [[11:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40968.64s)]
*  Thirdly, if needed, occupants will be subject to criminal proceedings, but we're going to give the judge the power to order people accused of illegal occupation [[11:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40977.64s)]
*  and to put them in public spaces. [[11:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40989.64s)]
*  For the simple drug position, we're going to give the judge the option to order treatment against drugs. [[11:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=40992.64s)]
*  And for the more serious criminals, whose addiction is a factor in their crime, [[11:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41001.64s)]
*  we're going to give the judge more power to order treatment and common-law tests inside prisons to counter their addiction and maximize the possibility of real rehabilitation. [[11:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41007.64s)]
*  Like that, we're going to bring back hope to make changes, hope that people can escape and free themselves from these horrible camps. [[11:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41022.64s)]
*  The hell that blocks their lives will be replaced with hope for a better future to make changes. [[11:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41033.64s)]
*  Finally, we will make it possible for people to afford homes again. [[11:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41041.64s)]
*  Our plan will axe the sales tax on home building, incentivize municipalities to cut their building taxes to knock $100,000 of taxation off the cost of a home. [[11:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41045.64s)]
*  We'll incentivize municipalities to speed up permits, free up land, and cut development taxes to build 15% more homes per year. [[11:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41057.64s)]
*  We'll allow 300,000 homes to be built on federal lands that are otherwise underused or unused completely. [[11:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41066.64s)]
*  This plan will allow 2.3 million affordable homes to be built for a change. [[11:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41075.64s)]
*  We're going to make it possible for people to have a place to live. [[11:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41082.64s)]
*  You know, many of the people in these camps, they didn't start off with that life. [[11:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41085.64s)]
*  But what has been happening is because there's absolutely no hope for them. [[11:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41089.64s)]
*  There might be a young person who is working 70 hours a week just to afford the rent and food, not saving up a nickel for a future down payment. [[11:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41093.64s)]
*  Never no light at the end of the tunnel. [[11:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41102.64s)]
*  So what happens then? [[11:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41105.64s)]
*  Well, they relieve that hopelessness with a dose of the wrong drug. [[11:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41106.64s)]
*  Then they're addicted. [[11:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41111.64s)]
*  Then they're out of their apartment and on the street. [[11:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41112.64s)]
*  We have to reverse the housing, the liberal housing hell and inflation that has made life so hopeless for so many. [[11:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41114.64s)]
*  We cannot afford a mother 15 years of liberal inflation and depression. [[11:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41122.64s)]
*  We need a change. [[11:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41128.64s)]
*  And that's why we're here offering that change. [[11:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41130.64s)]
*  This is about more than just cleaning up our sidewalks. [[11:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41133.64s)]
*  It's about bringing back a good life for Canadians, the life that we used to take for granted. [[11:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41135.64s)]
*  A Canada where hard work pays off for a change, where families can raise their children safely for a change, where seniors can walk without fear for a change, [[11:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41140.64s)]
*  where people don't shun our doors, our downtowns for a change, where businesses can take down the boards on their windows and open up for serving customers and hiring workers for a change. [[11:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41149.64s)]
*  We can't afford a fourth liberal term of rising costs, crime and chaos under the liberals with the same liberal ministers, the same liberal MPs, the same liberal advisors. [[11:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41163.64s)]
*  We need a new Conservative government that will change course on crime and common sense laws. [[11:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41173.64s)]
*  We will strengthen our border to keep out illegal drugs and guns, ensure repeat offenders go to jail and never come out. [[11:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41179.64s)]
*  We will restore law and order, putting murderers behind bars. [[11:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41185.64s)]
*  If we're going to bring in life sentences for fentanyl traffickers so that they never come out again, they are mass murderers and they will be treated like mass murderers when I'm prime minister. [[11:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41190.64s)]
*  We will shut down the taxpayer funded drug dens and replace them with wonderful treatment centres filled with hope and excitement for people ready to start their lives. [[11:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41201.64s)]
*  We will give the young men and women caught in this cycle of drugs and despair evidence based treatments so we can bring our loved ones home drug free for a change. [[11:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41211.64s)]
*  It's time to stop the crime for a change and the chaos for a change. [[11:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41221.64s)]
*  Put law abiding Canadians first for a change. That is how we bring hope for a change. [[11:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41225.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. Let's bring it home. [[11:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41233.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41235.64s)]
*  We will now go to questions and we will start with a call in question from the phone line. [[11:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41246.64s)]
*  Thank you guys. Thank you. [[11:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41251.64s)]
*  Thank you. And your first question comes from the line for Renee Pierre-Fontaine from Toronto, Léonard. Please go ahead. [[11:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41255.64s)]
*  Hello. [[11:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41261.64s)]
*  Hello. [[11:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41264.64s)]
*  Hello, Monsieur Poilier. [[11:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41276.64s)]
*  In this context, the media is just supporting Canada and blocking access to the content of our media. [[11:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41278.64s)]
*  Political parties have still bought thousands of dollars in ads on their platforms rather than supporting our local media. [[11:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41284.64s)]
*  So what is the position of the Conservatives in the face of the C-18 law that forces American digital companies to indemnify Canadian media to share their content? [[11:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41291.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41302.64s)]
*  A good question. [[11:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41304.64s)]
*  After the lost liberal decade, we can't even have access to the media articles on Facebook and Instagram. [[11:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41306.64s)]
*  Liberal censorship policies have killed a lot of media, reduced the number of media. [[11:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41316.64s)]
*  Independent media are now blocked from sharing their history. [[11:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41323.64s)]
*  Perhaps that is what the Liberals want after having inflated inflation, housing costs, criminalization of the rich. [[11:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41328.64s)]
*  The Liberals want less media. They want to control everything. [[11:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41337.64s)]
*  We cannot allow a fourth liberal mandate for inflation, real estate inflation, out of control criminality. [[11:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41341.64s)]
*  We need to change that. [[11:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41353.64s)]
*  With a new Conservative government that will allow the media to share their information on social media, including the issue of accessibility. [[11:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41355.64s)]
*  We will make changes with affordable houses, affordable grocery stores, safe streets. [[11:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41370.64s)]
*  That is the choice in the elections. [[11:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41379.64s)]
*  After a decade of costs and crime that is increasing, can we allow a fourth mandate or should it change to give you a better life in the safe communities? [[11:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41381.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[11:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41394.64s)]
*  The question is, what is the best way to prevent this? [[11:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41409.64s)]
*  The answer is, we can't. [[11:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41412.64s)]
*  We have to make sure that we have a third mandate. [[11:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41414.64s)]
*  We have to make sure that we have a fourth mandate. [[11:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41417.64s)]

*  The question is not the answer. [[11:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41462.64s)]
*  What we need is a new conservative government to bring change. [[11:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41464.64s)]

*  I would like to actually build on the previous question. [[11:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41484.64s)]
*  You had said previously that your government would cut funding for certain broadcasters and news outlets. [[11:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41486.64s)]

*  Weekly funds. [[11:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41508.64s)]

*  Liberal term. It's not just local media that are suffering under the Liberals, it's everybody. [[11:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41545.84s)]
*  It's small businesses, it's shop owners, it's the steel workers here in Hamilton that Mark [[11:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41550.96s)]

*  Hi Brad Hunter, Toronto Sun. My question is the law and order has been a cornerstone of your platform. [[11:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41612.560000000005s)]

*  you know some 16 year old kids in the morgue following a shootout with Toronto cops [[11:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41627.28s)]
*  you know he pulled first and but what's the kid doing with the gun you know if he survived was [[11:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41633.44s)]
*  he only going to do 18 months what what what do you think should be done with the young offender [[11:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41639.52s)]

*  is another tragic result of the lost liberal decade of lax criminal justice laws, weak borders, [[11:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41652.96s)]
*  and drugs on our streets. You know our kids are now more vulnerable to gang recruitment than ever [[11:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41663.76s)]

*  I want every young person in this country to reject a life of crime knowing that there's [[11:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41748.560000000005s)]
*  something so much better we have in store for them, a job where they can excel, a business that they [[11:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41752.8s)]
*  can start, a community where they will thrive and succeed, a nice home where they'll raise families [[11:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41759.12s)]
*  in the future and give grandchildren to their parents. That is the beautiful future that we [[11:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41766.48s)]
*  have. I call it the Canadian promise. Let's bring it home for a change. Thank you. [[11:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41772.32s)]
*  We will now go to the final question. [[11:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41780.32s)]
*  Hi Mr. Poliev, Triasri Global News. Canada could be headed into a recession yet your platform does not [[11:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41782.08s)]
*  account for this uncertainty. How do you justify that? Well my platform, when you say it doesn't [[11:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41791.76s)]
*  account for that, can you explain what you mean by that? Well part of your platform projects growth [[11:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41799.76s)]
*  based on projects that have yet to happen, you know, by repealing C-69, by having growth with [[11:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41805.44s)]
*  pipelines that could take years. So I just wonder should you have erred more on the side of caution [[11:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41811.520000000004s)]
*  given the fact that we're only a few months into a trade war? Well listen, first of all the reason [[11:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41816.8s)]
*  our economy has no growth and has been in a per capita recession for the last five years is because [[11:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41822.96s)]
*  of the policies that Mark Carney advised Justin Trudeau's Liberals to implement. They are the [[11:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41828.96s)]
*  reckless ones and now what is ultimately the most reckless of all is that a period of uncertainty, [[11:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41834.24s)]
*  Mark Carney says he wants to keep all of the spending that Justin Trudeau planned [[11:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41840.96s)]
*  and then stack 130 billion dollars more spending on top of that for a total of quarter trillion [[11:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41845.28s)]
*  dollars of extra inflationary debt that will drive up the cost of food and fuel. Now you ask me in a [[11:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41852.0s)]
*  period of economic weakness after the Liberals have been in power for three terms, whether it is [[11:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41859.44s)]
*  wise to campaign on economic growth, it's not only wise, it's essential for a change that we grow our [[11:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41866.08s)]
*  economy. We need to unleash... Of course it's... [[11:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41875.04s)]
*  What is... What would be reckless is to continue with the same Liberal policies. Mr. Carney wants to keep Bill C-69. [[11:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41879.52s)]
*  He wants to keep half of our oil in the ground. He wants to bring in a massive new industrial carbon [[11:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41892.719999999994s)]
*  tax on the steel mills here at Stelco and DeFasco, elsewhere Algoma and Evraz to shut down our steel [[11:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41898.479999999996s)]
*  industry with taxes. That is more Liberal recklessness. What is actually responsible [[11:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41908.16s)]
*  is to unleash our resources by repealing the no development law C-69, getting rid of the Liberal [[11:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41915.200000000004s)]
*  energy cap, bringing in the shovel-ready zones that are pre-permitted for construction, [[11:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41920.880000000005s)]
*  incentivizing 2.3 million home builds. All of these projects will put our people to work with [[11:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41927.12s)]
*  powerful paychecks that abide them affordable food and homes for a change. Thank you very much. [[11:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41933.44s)]
*  Thank you everyone. That concludes today's press conference. [[11:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41939.840000000004s)]
*  That concludes today's press conference. Thank you. [[11:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=41946.560000000005s)]
*  Amazing. [[11:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42023.520000000004s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much for that great Hamilton Steeltown welcome. It's great to be here [[11:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42028.16s)]
*  in the hammer. Of course, as we know, there is an election on Monday and it comes down to one word. [[11:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42037.04s)]
*  Change. Change. Change. Change. Change. [[11:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42045.12s)]
*  Change so you can afford food and housing. Change that you are safe on your streets. [[11:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42053.840000000004s)]
*  Change so we can bring home our jobs and strength. Change to put Canada first. And change is the [[11:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42061.12s)]
*  name of our plan, our election platform for an affordable life, for safe streets, for Canada first, [[11:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42067.920000000006s)]
*  for a change. [[11:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42074.56s)]
*  That's why I'm so happy to have the team that will deliver that change. Ned Couric in Hamilton East, Sony Creek. [[11:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42104.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42124.16s)]
*  Dan Muse, Flamborough, Glanbrook, Grant, North. [[11:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42132.72s)]
*  Erica Alexander. Give her a round of applause. [[11:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42141.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[11:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42144.32s)]
*  She, of course, is the granddaughter of the great Lincoln Alexander, who was the first [[11:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42149.2s)]
*  black member of Parliament, first black minister in Canadian history, a great conservative, [[11:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42154.0s)]
*  a towering legend in the Canadian story, and we look forward to her carrying on his wonderful legacy. [[11:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42160.48s)]
*  Ken Hewitt, Hayden Lawrence, Emily Brown, Ron Chinzer. Give them all a round of applause. [[11:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42174.48s)]
*  I'd like to thank the many members of the Hamilton Police Association who are joining me today. [[11:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42185.36s)]
*  I would also like to thank, based on last night's news, I don't know if you all heard this news, [[11:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42190.64s)]
*  but it's official. The Toronto Police Union is ready for change and they are endorsing the [[11:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42196.48s)]
*  Conservative plan to make our streets safe for all Canadians. [[11:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42203.68s)]
*  It means the world to me to have the support of our most courageous people, [[11:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42216.48s)]
*  the police who put on a uniform and they leave in the morning kissing their kids goodbye knowing [[11:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42220.08s)]
*  that they may not return. They do all of that so that you and I can walk our streets safely. [[11:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42225.68s)]
*  Yesterday I released a plan for change that will make life more affordable and safe in our country. [[11:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42232.0s)]
*  Change means safe streets, good jobs, powerful paychecks. Change means unleashing our resources [[11:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42240.0s)]
*  so we can stand on our own two feet and stand up to the world from a position of strength. [[11:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42245.44s)]
*  Over the next four years my plan will cut $55 billion of bureaucracy, consultants, foreign aid, [[11:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42250.560000000005s)]
*  and liberal waste in order to reduce by 70% the liberal deficit that we will inherit on Monday. [[11:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42259.76s)]
*  By contrast, we learned that Mark Carney's platform was actually written for Justin Trudeau. [[11:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42278.0s)]
*  It was actually, this is not a figure of speech, the platform team of the Liberal Party wrote up [[11:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42284.96000000001s)]
*  a platform in the fall and they gave it to Trudeau and then when they switched him out [[11:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42291.280000000006s)]
*  and replaced him with his economic advisor, oh we've got a little cough there, we're okay? [[11:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42296.96000000001s)]
*  All right, all right, I think he was reacting to the deficit in our Carney's platform. [[11:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42305.840000000004s)]
*  You know, you know I always like to tell the story of when our little baby boy was born and he came out and [[11:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42315.36s)]
*  little baby Cruz and he wasn't crying and of course that's every parent's worst nightmare [[11:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42326.64000000001s)]
*  and then the doctor came over and whispered something in his ear and all of a sudden a great [[11:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42331.04s)]
*  cry went out and we were so relieved that he was going to be okay so we held him in our arms and [[11:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42335.520000000004s)]
*  afterwards I walked up to the doctor and I said, doctor what did you tell our little infant to [[11:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42339.44s)]
*  make him cry ever so much? He said, well I just told him that his share of the national debt was [[11:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42344.48s)]
*  $90,000. But it's about to get a lot bigger under Mark Carney. You know, they took this platform, [[11:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42348.72s)]
*  they wrote it for Trudeau and then Mark Carney takes the leadership and doesn't bother to write [[11:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42362.96s)]
*  his own plan because his plan has been carried out over the last five years while he was Trudeau's [[11:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42369.6s)]
*  economic advisor so why would he presume to change anything? Well there is one thing he changed. [[11:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42376.96s)]
*  In addition to all of the spending that Trudeau had already budgeted for, Mark Carney's plan would [[11:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42383.28s)]
*  add $130 billion more. When you take Trudeau's plans and Carney's promises, a fourth liberal term [[11:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42390.56s)]
*  would mean a quarter trillion dollars of additional inflationary debt that will drive up food and [[11:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42400.24s)]
*  housing prices even more. In fact, Mark Carney, I've said he's no different than Trudeau. The truth is [[11:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42406.56s)]
*  he will cost even more than Justin Trudeau. He has phantom numbers he can't explain. [[11:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42412.88s)]
*  Yesterday he was lashing out at even liberal economists. Liberal economist Trevor Toom said [[11:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42419.520000000004s)]
*  that Mark Carney's platform is reckless and irresponsible and Mark Carney arrogantly lashed out [[11:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42425.68s)]
*  not wanting people to know how much liberal inflation he would bring if he were to be re-elected [[11:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42432.8s)]
*  for a fourth liberal term. Now add it all up. Can you afford a fourth liberal term of a quarter [[11:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42439.28s)]
*  trillion dollars more inflationary debt? Can you afford that after the last liberal decade? [[11:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42448.08s)]
*  To pay for it all he would have to raise taxes. There's no question he would reinstate the tax [[11:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42454.96s)]
*  increases Trudeau had planned. He would raise other taxes only on others not on him. He would [[11:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42461.12s)]
*  stash his cash in overseas tax havens but over the last lost liberal decade Canada is heading [[11:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42466.64s)]
*  in the wrong direction and fast. I don't know if you saw the story this week about the government, [[11:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42474.72s)]
*  the liberal government actually published a report about how the country will look in 15 years. Now [[11:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42480.0s)]
*  this is important because what liberals have been telling you is forget about the last [[11:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42485.200000000004s)]
*  10 years of liberal government. Pretend it didn't happen. That was then, this is now, [[11:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42490.16s)]
*  the past is the past. Forget about it. Well, what does the future look like? Not according to me [[11:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42494.48s)]
*  but according to them. Well they published this report and you know it'd be nice, [[11:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42501.6s)]
*  frankly this is a draw dropping report to be published by the government of Canada [[11:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42506.56s)]
*  before the election. Future lives, social mobility in question. This is the government of Canada's [[11:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42510.96s)]
*  own report. If I had alleged the things in this report the media would be attacking me as outlandish [[11:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42517.28s)]
*  but this is what the government says the future has in store on our current trajectory and I will [[11:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42523.2s)]
*  emphasize that this is their own words. This is what they have to say. I say that many times just [[11:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42529.2s)]
*  so because the shock value of this report is so massive that you would be, you would find it hard [[11:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42535.92s)]
*  to believe the things that they say. The report says that in 2040 more people may struggle to [[11:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42542.159999999996s)]
*  afford rent, bills and groceries on housing. In 2040 owning a home is not a realistic goal for many [[11:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42547.84s)]
*  and inequality between those who rent and those who own has become a key social driver, [[11:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42554.240000000005s)]
*  a key driver of social economic and political conflict. The report paints a terrifying picture [[11:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42559.44s)]
*  of national spiral of depression and decline. It forecasts widespread mental health crises [[11:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42565.44s)]
*  quote if young workers forcing young workers to actually leave the country. If young workers [[11:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42572.4s)]
*  leave Canada, I'm quoting now, it may be harder to pay for the systems that support a growing number [[11:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42577.920000000006s)]
*  of older people. It says that people will lose faith in the Canadian project altogether and this [[11:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42583.28s)]
*  the most startling comment of all that food prices will become so unaffordable on the current path [[11:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42590.4s)]
*  that people may have to start quote hunt hunt might have to start hunt fish and forage on public [[11:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42596.72s)]
*  lands and waterways. You imagine in Canada where people are to the point where they can't even go [[11:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42604.56s)]
*  into a grocery store anymore and they actually have to go forage on public lands in order to [[11:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42611.68s)]
*  scrape out an existence. This sounds incredible like something from a post-apocalyptic television [[11:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42616.96s)]
*  television series like the fallout the last of us but this is not that it is a liberal government [[11:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42623.2s)]
*  forecast and it's not for a hundred years from now it's for 15 years from now. Is that the future [[11:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42629.6s)]
*  that you want for your kids? No. That is not change that is more of the inflationary [[11:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42635.2s)]
*  spiral the Liberals have brought us over the last decade and Mark Carney will continue with every [[11:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42641.92s)]
*  single policy he inherits from Justin Trudeau. They might he might look different he might use [[11:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jq1PWMYhADc&t=42648.32s)]
