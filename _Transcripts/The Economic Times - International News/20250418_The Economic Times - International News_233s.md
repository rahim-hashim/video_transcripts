Video Description: Point Roberts, a tiny US town trapped below Canada, is facing economic collapse. Trump’s tariffs and insults toward Canada have scared off tourists and strained cross-border ties. Local businesses, from a tavern to a rubber duck museum, are shutting down. What was once a quirky destination is now a symbol of trade war fallout.

# “We love you… but we won’t visit”: Trump’s tariff turns Canadian tourists away from US border town
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI)
*  Welcome to Point Roberts, Washington, a tiny American town stranded below British Columbia. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=0.0s)]
*  Now it's a frontline casualty in Trump's tariff war. Business is collapsing, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=5.36s)]
*  tourists aren't crossing the border, and Trump's tough talk on Canada? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  It's turning longtime friends into boycotters, from rubber ducks to pints of beer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=15.6s)]
*  Everything here is feeling the heat. Nick Kyniski owns the local tavern. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=21.12s)]
*  He's a dual citizen. His bar used to be packed. Now, empty tables, no staff, and 14-hour shifts, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=25.84s)]
*  solo. I'm a dual citizen and we rely heavily on the Canadians coming down here. And with [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=34.08s)]
*  President Trump, what he said, he's offended him. I can understand tariffs. I don't really understand [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=42.56s)]
*  him what's going to happen with all this, but it's got the world kind of going crazy right now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Business is business, but you don't have to be rude. He's talking about Trump mocking Canada [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=55.36s)]
*  as America's 51st state. That's not politics to folks here. It's personal. The Rubber Duck Museum [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  is leaving. Yes, an actual museum for rubber ducks. Neil and Crystal King say Canadian visitors kept [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=68.16s)]
*  them afloat, but emails poured in. We literally woke up one day to just emails of just regulars [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=74.96s)]
*  who said, I'm sorry, I can't come anymore. I cannot support your country. I cannot support [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=81.52s)]
*  your government. We love you guys. We're so sorry, but we can't. They're moving the whole [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=86.16s)]
*  thing to Canada this summer. Why? Tariffs on Chinese goods made importing ducks more expensive [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=91.28s)]
*  in the U.S. Point Roberts was once a shipping haven for Canadians. Not anymore. Kendra Levine's [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=97.28s)]
*  family parcel shop survived COVID, but it couldn't survive Trump's trade war. In our warehouse, we [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=104.24s)]
*  used to have racking all the way almost to that end over there, and we'd have about 3,000 packages [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=110.0s)]
*  in here routinely. People would come in, pick up, more would come in, and it would still stay right [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=116.32s)]
*  around 3,000. Today, when we opened, we had 232 packages. Customers say, see you in four years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=121.84s)]
*  Restaurants, souvenir shops, and small attractions, they all depend on each other. When one closes, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=130.16s)]
*  the rest wobble. It's as the dominoes start falling, more will fall because you need [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=136.24s)]
*  restaurants to bring people into town. You need things to do. You need souvenirs if you want to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=142.4s)]
*  get people to come vacation in your town. You need to have businesses open, and so without them, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  as each one falls, they affect each other. We all are dependent on each other, and the general [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=154.08s)]
*  sentiment has been a little grim lately. Without them, the town falls apart, and it's already [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=160.56s)]
*  happening. It's not just here. The whole country's feeling it. Foreign tourism is falling fast. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=167.92000000000002s)]
*  Canadian flight bookings to the U.S. are down 70%. European hotel bookings in the U.S. have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=174.32s)]
*  dropped 25%. Economists say the damage could hit $90 billion this year. Locals like Terry [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=180.24s)]
*  Mathey have lived here for 50 years. He says it's not just the tariffs, it's the tone. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=187.28s)]
*  Even if he said, well, we're going to remove the tariffs, I think the damage has been done as far as [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=193.2s)]
*  how they feel about it. I think if there was a change in administrations, it would probably [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=202.0s)]
*  change right away. Point Roberts isn't just a border town. It's a barometer of diplomacy, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=206.48s)]
*  of dollars, and of the deep divide between allies. And right now, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=213.36s)]
*  this tiny town is waving a half-American, half-Canadian flag and holding on. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wP4juSbLRI&t=218.56s)]
