# LIVE | EU's major announcement on trade talks with Trump & Ukraine war
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w)
*  To repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=0.0s)]
*  good time well ahead of COP 30 and this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago and then this is a message that we have been [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14.92s)]
*  passing constantly and repeatedly that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19.64s)]
*  of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=28.36s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law which will be presented [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=35.6s)]
*  before summer. Yes, Christian. A follow-up. Thanks, thanks, Paula. So you said once agreed [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. Does that mean that you're counting on [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=49.84s)]
*  the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? And just repeating [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=55.839999999999996s)]
*  my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=61.28s)]
*  any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? On the timing and on the order of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  things, let's take one step at a time. The first step is to present the 2040 climate law and this [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=73.28s)]
*  is what we're working towards and then we'll take the next steps from there on. And with regard to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=80.32s)]
*  the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, but we can [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=86.16s)]
*  confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=92.36s)]
*  Any other question to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=99.68s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=110.88s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=116.96000000000001s)]
*  Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. And that would include any intermediaries acting [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=121.12s)]
*  on Huawei's behalf would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=125.8s)]
*  advance the interests of the company. Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=129.8s)]
*  exactly you draw the line? Because this would have far-reaching implications considering that [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=134.04s)]
*  the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. So are consultancies, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=138.8s)]
*  standardization, organization, both of them, for instance, affected as well? I've got a couple [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=145.44s)]
*  more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=150.64s)]
*  with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically and would evaluate [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. My question is how can the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=158.84s)]
*  Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=163.48s)]
*  of Huawei in particular? One more question, practical. Evie Rekunin was supposed to meet [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=168.24s)]
*  with Ektar today, which Huawei is a member of. So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was canceled, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=172.68s)]
*  sorry. So I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=177.04s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. On the last one, I don't know, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=180.52s)]
*  I'll have to check that with... It was canceled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=186.36s)]
*  we can come back to you on that. For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  representatives can no longer access Commission officials. They can't enter the building. It is [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=200.36s)]
*  not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=206.44s)]
*  and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. So there are smart [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=213.88s)]
*  people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand whether a particular [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=219.72s)]
*  issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization relates to issues that are of interest [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=224.2s)]
*  to Huawei or not. And that's why we're doing it. So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis. And if there's [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=233.8s)]
*  any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=237.88000000000002s)]
*  It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=244.12s)]
*  but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=251.4s)]
*  European Commission. So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=257.72s)]
*  issue, the meeting proceeds, where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=261.72s)]
*  and as necessary, put a stop to it. That's it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Jorge. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=266.12s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=277.0s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=281.64000000000004s)]
*  sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. Obviously, I remember that the Commission [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=286.52s)]
*  criticized this decision back then. The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=293.79999999999995s)]
*  China and the European Union. Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  put on the table again? Or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=306.03999999999996s)]
*  brought back in any form? Thank you. Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=311.72s)]
*  formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted, but Olaf, you can tell us more. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=319.48s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=325.32000000000005s)]
*  about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. Yes, Jorge. A follow-up. Yes, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=336.28000000000003s)]
*  in a previous time, before many things happened in Europe and around the world, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=341.88s)]
*  do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=347.0s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=354.52s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olaf? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=357.96s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=364.04s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor Vlinic, Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=375.8s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=381.24s)]
*  EU-UK summit on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=388.12s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=397.24s)]
*  Minister Starmer today, also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=404.6s)]
*  bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=409.72s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=415.56s)]
*  including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment. But of course, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=426.12s)]
*  today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=431.72s)]
*  Yes. Yes, Vitaly. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=437.64s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see reaction of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=448.28s)]
*  colors. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=455.08s)]
*  Poland thinks so and gives such kind of commentaries? Thank you. Yes, and Joom will take [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=464.28s)]
*  up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=474.11999999999995s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. Sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIVP has just published a social media post on [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=482.84s)]
*  the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=502.76s)]
*  on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=511.0s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. Russia [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=516.2s)]
*  is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. Regarding your second question on [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=525.64s)]
*  possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=531.8s)]
*  but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=537.0s)]
*  the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=544.12s)]
*  without Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. And upholding Ukraine's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=550.6s)]
*  independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. Absolutely. And we reiterate those [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=558.84s)]
*  principles also under the current circumstances and developments. Any other questions to Guillaume [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=565.72s)]
*  with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=573.72s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not Ukraine but foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=581.8000000000001s)]
*  we've seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the commission about a potential [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=586.12s)]
*  escalation in the region? Yes, Guillaume. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=590.84s)]
*  Indeed. As you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=597.32s)]
*  situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for a peaceful [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=604.2800000000001s)]
*  solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=611.48s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=617.4s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=625.88s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=631.32s)]
*  commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=637.16s)]
*  Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=642.36s)]
*  two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=646.76s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the US is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the principles [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=656.36s)]
*  by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement of [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=662.04s)]
*  Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. These are the [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=669.16s)]
*  principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=675.8s)]
*  circumstances. Yes. Thank you very much. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=683.24s)]
*  Silvia Yusuf from the Pais. Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=690.04s)]
*  moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the White House? I mean, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=696.84s)]
*  there are several meetings in the next days and there are points also around where everybody [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=703.0s)]
*  will be there. Do you think there's a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=709.08s)]
*  Trump? We're looking into possibilities to meet, as you know. Nothing is confirmed for the moment, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=716.28s)]
*  so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, but we'll keep you posted if that should [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=722.76s)]
*  be the case in the coming days. Yes. Thank you. Ibrahim Arad, RG News Agency, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=730.68s)]
*  Italy. That means that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=741.56s)]
*  for the meeting? Thank you. The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. That is [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=750.6800000000001s)]
*  the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. If other opportunities arise [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=760.0400000000001s)]
*  in the context, in the margins of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. But the main [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=768.52s)]
*  objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=777.56s)]
*  Any other questions? Yes, Anna. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=787.3199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=794.5999999999999s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=800.5999999999999s)]
*  of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? Because in this century, 62,000 [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=805.72s)]
*  Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=814.0400000000001s)]
*  religious extremists. So my question is, because Madam President will be there, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=820.28s)]
*  would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=824.76s)]
*  because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=829.8000000000001s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defence [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=836.6s)]
*  of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=847.0s)]
*  whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=854.44s)]
*  and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=862.04s)]
*  but wherever this is at stake. Yes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=869.64s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=878.92s)]
*  sorry, they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=885.0s)]
*  most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? As you know, there are [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=891.0s)]
*  colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defence of freedom of religion, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=901.8s)]
*  whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=909.08s)]
*  discriminated against across the world, and this is something for which the President stands for, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=915.4s)]
*  the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. Other questions? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=924.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=934.44s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=940.7600000000001s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=949.24s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=956.6800000000001s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=959.48s)]
*  EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=971.88s)]
*  Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. Is this affecting relations [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=979.48s)]
*  of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations of EU with Kosovo? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=987.4s)]
*  And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. President of Serbia, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=995.72s)]
*  Aleksandar Vucic, confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. We heard the warnings or [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1000.92s)]
*  suggestions by higher representatives that candidate countries should not participate in [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1010.36s)]
*  that event. So I was wondering whether High Representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1015.56s)]
*  the entire Commission and what's opinion of the President's underlying on this and what will be [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event for their relations [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1028.28s)]
*  with European Union or is just a statement that will have no consequences? Thank you. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1035.6399999999999s)]
*  We're going to start, Liam. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1042.36s)]
*  Yeah. So on Kosovo, I would, you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1045.8799999999999s)]
*  affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries. What I can say, indeed, it is in Kosovo's [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1054.9199999999998s)]
*  interest to swiftly forms in institutions. It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1063.96s)]
*  reforms and moving forward on this path. It is also important on other issues such as the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1072.44s)]
*  Gross Plan. As you know, we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to continue the work [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1082.92s)]
*  on this path as well. So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. On your second question, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1093.32s)]
*  only quickly give me up. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1105.16s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in and Kjom, you may then complement if necessary. Indeed, we have been [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1106.68s)]
*  clear with not only the member states, but also our partners and including candidate countries such [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1126.04s)]
*  as Serbia, that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual with President Putin's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1134.68s)]
*  regime and in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1144.6s)]
*  against Ukraine. Anything else there, Kjom? [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1155.8s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week, precisely on this issue, that Serbia has [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1160.68s)]
*  applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU and the EU wants to count on Serbia [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1166.3600000000001s)]
*  as a reliable partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. And we need [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1173.96s)]
*  Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1181.0s)]
*  including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1189.16s)]
*  relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1193.48s)]
*  Follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. So this is the second time this [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1203.3200000000002s)]
*  topic has been opened here at the midday press briefing. And like the first time, we don't hear [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1210.28s)]
*  any concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. So [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1215.56s)]
*  if I am getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1224.9199999999998s)]
*  We are not saying that there won't be any consequences. It's too early to [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1234.04s)]
*  pre-judge. We will not speak later, as you know. And we're talking about an event taking place on [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1238.04s)]
*  9th May, so it's early to tell this stage. Yes, Carl. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1244.6s)]
*  Same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. Last time I checked, Prime Minister [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1254.36s)]
*  Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. So is the Commission [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1267.48s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1272.68s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1278.1200000000001s)]
*  and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. And therefore, we defend that we should refrain [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1286.84s)]
*  from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1296.84s)]
*  celebrations in Moscow. And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1307.1599999999999s)]
*  in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1314.6s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1326.2s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1334.12s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1342.2s)]
*  I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1351.08s)]
*  to meet the president of the United States, because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1357.96s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1367.72s)]
*  also internal affairs. After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1375.96s)]
*  personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1384.3600000000001s)]
*  is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. We start with Tunisia. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1393.24s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1402.36s)]
*  in Tunisia closely. The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1410.6s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1415.9599999999998s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1421.7199999999998s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. The rule of law, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1427.96s)]
*  human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution and [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1434.2s)]
*  formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1439.8s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of President [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1447.48s)]
*  von der Leyen's participation in and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1453.64s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. For the moment, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1460.2800000000002s)]
*  there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it change. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1468.2800000000002s)]
*  Here to the end. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1473.96s)]
*  Zombie. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1488.3600000000001s)]
*  of the legal service, according to which the safe proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1503.88s)]
*  Article 122 at least for part of the proposal. I would like to know how the Commission wants to [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1514.96s)]
*  proceed. If you want to modify the proposal, maybe by dividing it in two parts, how to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1526.16s)]
*  suggest the Parliament's hopes, or if you want to proceed without an amendment. Thank you very much. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1537.76s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, Thomas. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1546.76s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. We are of course aware of what has been reported in the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  Parliament. After that, I will not comment on this. Let me just remind you in a more [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1555.38s)]
*  global way that today we have a risk for our security that is real. This is the reason [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1560.74s)]
*  why the Commission has actually proposed this new instrument for safe defense, which [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1566.5s)]
*  will allow Member States to make joint purchases in defense. This instrument is actually established [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1571.5s)]
*  on Article 122. Allow me to remind you that in the presidential guidelines and political guidelines, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1579.82s)]
*  the President has reminded us that Article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances, [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1587.22s)]
*  like the one we are currently living under. In the previous mandate, Article 122 has [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1592.4199999999998s)]
*  actually already been activated, also for exceptional circumstances. Let me remind you [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1600.34s)]
*  of the pandemic, COVID, or the gas prices, where this instrument was activated. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1605.82s)]
*  The Commission remains of course on its proposed proposal, which has been established. Today, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1612.26s)]
*  it is up to the Member States to agree. I think that the Commission has always been [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1619.78s)]
*  available to explain its choices. I just did it here, but we are of course [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1623.62s)]
*  also ready to do it with other institutions. Thank you, Thomas. Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1630.66s)]
*  Yes, this morning, the Commission of the Industry and the Security of Defense of the European Parliament [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1639.46s)]
*  voted on the EDIP program, which provides eligibility conditions with a European [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1647.5s)]
*  membership of 70% of European members. What is the Commission's reaction to this adoption? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1655.3s)]
*  And now the question that arises is the inclusion of the potential of the United Kingdom in this program. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1662.8999999999999s)]
*  Has the Commission sent proposals to the Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  And does the President intend to speak to Mr. Starmer about this today? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1674.06s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I will leave the second part to Paula. I have no specific comment [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1678.14s)]
*  to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or in the Council on a proposal. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1688.66s)]
*  I can remind you, indeed, I just spoke in the previous answer and from SAFE, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1693.0600000000002s)]
*  that the proposal that we made, there is an European purchase clause that is fixed at 65%. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1696.14s)]
*  I also remember in this context that the United Kingdom can already [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1701.8200000000002s)]
*  participate at a rate of 35% in this program when it is actually implemented. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1706.7s)]
*  After, in general, we are working closely with third-party states that share our [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1712.1000000000001s)]
*  visions and that are very close to us, including the United Kingdom. So we are working closely with the United Kingdom. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1717.74s)]
*  Yes, Karl. So for a participation of the United Kingdom at SAFE, as you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1723.98s)]
*  first of all, a, I don't know if we say it, a dedicated partnership. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1735.02s)]
*  That's it. And so it is also in this sense that we are working and I am waiting for it to be [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1740.46s)]
*  discussed between Madame the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1750.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1763.0200000000002s)]
*  I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1766.8600000000001s)]
*  but he didn't really answer the question. It's about the visit in Rome. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1774.5400000000002s)]
*  We understand that you take the opportunity if there is some to meet Trump, but is there an [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1779.42s)]
*  official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? Is there any official thing that you [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1783.82s)]
*  send now to the White House or isn't there? That's really everything I can say about the [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1790.22s)]
*  participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. And as said, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1798.1399999999999s)]
*  if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1801.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1807.18s)]
*  Jen. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1808.46s)]
*  John, Bloomberg News. Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. Is there any [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1812.7s)]
*  imminent visit of Commissioner of the Kremlin, Executive Vice President, to the U.S. following [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1819.98s)]
*  the footsteps of other commissioners? And if so, who is she going to meet? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1827.42s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1833.4199999999998s)]
*  So, no plans that I can confirm today. I can just recall that EDP Virkunden is, of course, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1838.54s)]
*  engaging with her American counterparts, be it via letters that you were yourself referring to, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1845.8999999999999s)]
*  or be it with companies. So, the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1851.8999999999999s)]
*  Okay. I don't see any other questions. There's one there. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1857.18s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1868.46s)]
*  public data, user, without consent. Is the EU looking into that? Thank you. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1876.22s)]
*  Thomas, what do we know about this? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1883.6599999999999s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, we are. We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1888.06s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious. I will recall it that the protection of the data of our citizens [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1895.1799999999998s)]
*  is, of course, very important to us, and we're frontrunners in that field. So, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1901.4199999999998s)]
*  yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1906.22s)]
*  Okay. Any other questions? No, I don't see online questions either. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1908.54s)]
*  So, I wish you a very good afternoon, and thank you for your participation. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1917.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1939.42s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. A short announcement [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1957.98s)]
*  before going into your questions. As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1965.98s)]
*  where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1973.1000000000001s)]
*  energy security organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1981.1000000000001s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1988.3799999999999s)]
*  bilateral relations, and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=1996.06s)]
*  second half of May. At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2006.3s)]
*  efforts to advance reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2014.86s)]
*  of international partnerships in achieving these goals. I would like to invite you to follow the [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2021.34s)]
*  President's speech live on EBS, starting at approximately 10 past three London time. That's [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2029.26s)]
*  10 past four here in Brussels. And with this, we may move on to your questions. Yes, Christian. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2038.9399999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Marla. Christian Henry with NC Europe. I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2053.18s)]
*  call yesterday on COP 30, where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2056.7s)]
*  was discussed. Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2064.38s)]
*  present its NDC by September this year? And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2071.1s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer, but given the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2078.3s)]
*  tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight timeline, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2087.66s)]
*  can you clarify whether you're counting in a political agreement on the 2040 target [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2094.8599999999997s)]
*  before September, or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2099.8999999999996s)]
*  Can I ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2107.58s)]
*  and on our commitments? Anna Kaiser. Thank you. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2113.7400000000002s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2123.26s)]
*  a climate law, which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2130.78s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2137.9s)]
*  and we will include the 2040 emissions reduction target in that. And then once this is agreed, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2143.98s)]
*  the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, which will cover both the 2040, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2150.14s)]
*  because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, and a figure for 2035, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2156.78s)]
*  which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. And to repeat what we have [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2163.1s)]
*  had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2173.02s)]
*  COP 30. And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2180.22s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2187.34s)]
*  and repeatedly that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2192.2200000000003s)]
*  in good time ahead of COP. I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2200.2200000000003s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2207.02s)]
*  which will be presented before summer. Yes, Christian, a follow-up? [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2211.74s)]
*  Thanks, thanks Carla. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2218.14s)]
*  once agreed. Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2224.22s)]
*  before presenting the NDC? And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2228.54s)]
*  whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that they will become, the NDC will be coming [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2233.8999999999996s)]
*  before September? On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2239.1s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2246.54s)]
*  and then we'll take the next steps from there on. And with regard to the call yesterday, [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2251.98s)]
*  I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, but we can confirm [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2257.8199999999997s)]
*  that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2263.34s)]
*  Any other question to Anna Kaiser? Nope? Good, then we can move on. You had a question here. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2271.9s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poulet for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2283.02s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2287.6600000000003s)]
*  Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf, and that would include any intermediaries acting [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2291.74s)]
*  on Huawei's behalf who would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2296.2999999999997s)]
*  advance the interests of the company. Sorry for the long quote, but can you please clarify why [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2300.3799999999997s)]
*  exactly you draw the line? Because this would have far-reaching implications considering that [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2304.7s)]
*  the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. So are consultancies, [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2310.14s)]
*  standardization, organization, law firm, for instance, affected as well? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2316.14s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2320.38s)]
*  Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2323.66s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. My question is, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2328.62s)]
*  how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2333.58s)]
*  the interests of Huawei in particular? One more question, practical. EVP Rekunen was supposed to [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2338.3s)]
*  meet with Ecta today, which Huawei is a member of, so I'm just wondering, and the meeting was [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2343.02s)]
*  canceled, so I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2347.18s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. And the last one, I don't know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2352.14s)]
*  I'll have to check that with... It was canceled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2356.94s)]
*  we can come back to you on that. For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2365.02s)]
*  representatives can no longer access Commission officials. They can't enter the building. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2371.58s)]
*  It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2376.62s)]
*  of members, and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2383.98s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2388.22s)]
*  to understand whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2392.7s)]
*  relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not, and that's what we're doing. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2399.5s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis, and if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2405.1800000000003s)]
*  go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. It's as simple as that. So we're making sure [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2411.98s)]
*  that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, but we're not going to stop umbrella [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2416.46s)]
*  organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. So we look at [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2423.66s)]
*  each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2429.5s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail and, as necessary, put a stop to it. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2433.6600000000003s)]
*  And that is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olof? Yes, Khoraghi. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2438.1400000000003s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olof because it relates to trade and investment. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2447.6600000000003s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2452.3s)]
*  sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. Obviously, I remember that the Commission [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2457.18s)]
*  criticized this decision back then. The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2464.46s)]
*  China and the European Union. Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2470.7s)]
*  put on the table again, or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2476.7s)]
*  brought back in any form? Thank you. Yes, indeed. For Olof, as far as I know, we don't have the [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2482.38s)]
*  formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted, but Olof, you can tell us more. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2490.1400000000003s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2495.9s)]
*  about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. Yes, Khoraghi. A follow-up. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2499.42s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2506.62s)]
*  signed, let's say, in a previous time before many things happened in Europe and around the world, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2511.66s)]
*  do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2517.66s)]
*  Nice try, Khoraghi, but we're not going to go there. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2525.18s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olof? [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2528.62s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2534.7s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor Vlinic, Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2543.82s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK Summit on [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2548.7799999999997s)]
*  the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. Well, on this one, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2557.5s)]
*  as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today also [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2570.38s)]
*  in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2577.26s)]
*  among other, to also prepare the ground for the Summit in May. This is very much unique [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2581.34s)]
*  in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2592.6200000000003s)]
*  at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2598.54s)]
*  meeting will be part of the preparation of the Summit later in London in May. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2603.58s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, Vitaly. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2611.7400000000002s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, EUATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kyiv? I see reaction of [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2618.94s)]
*  colors. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2625.7400000000002s)]
*  Poland, he thinks so, and give such kind of commentary. Thank you. Yes, and Joom will take [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2634.94s)]
*  up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2644.7000000000003s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. Sorry. Hi. As you said, the [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2653.5s)]
*  HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2668.62s)]
*  Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2679.02s)]
*  on Kyiv and other cities last night. This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2684.78s)]
*  killed and over 70 injured. Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2692.94s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2700.22s)]
*  our position on the peace talks, but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2706.22s)]
*  really clear here. Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2712.2999999999997s)]
*  and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2718.14s)]
*  And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity is crucial. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2726.9399999999996s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2732.94s)]
*  Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2742.0600000000004s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2752.46s)]
*  we've seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the Commission about a potential [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2756.78s)]
*  escalation in the region? Indeed, as you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2761.5s)]
*  social media post on the situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2773.26s)]
*  underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2780.62s)]
*  And still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2788.0600000000004s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2796.46s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2801.98s)]
*  Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2807.7400000000002s)]
*  Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2812.94s)]
*  the two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2817.26s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2826.94s)]
*  principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2831.9s)]
*  of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. And these are the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2839.58s)]
*  principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2846.46s)]
*  circumstances. Yes. Thank you very much, Silvia Yusuf from El País. Besides reiterating the position, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2853.8199999999997s)]
*  is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2864.46s)]
*  directly to the White House? I mean, is there several meetings in the next days and where [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2870.78s)]
*  points also roam where everybody will be there? Do you think there's a possibility to [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2877.58s)]
*  talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? We're looking into possibilities to meet, [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2884.14s)]
*  as you know. Nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2891.42s)]
*  but we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2899.02s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Arad, AG News Agency, Italy. That means that you are trying to meet President [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2909.9s)]
*  Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. The objective in Rome is really [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2916.3s)]
*  the mourning of Pope Francis. That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2927.82s)]
*  in Rome. If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of that, of the funeral, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2935.5s)]
*  then they will be, of course, seized. But the main objective is obviously the participation [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2944.06s)]
*  of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. Any other questions? Yes, Anna. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2950.86s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2965.2599999999998s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2971.18s)]
*  European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2976.62s)]
*  Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and religious extremists. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2985.26s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2992.2200000000003s)]
*  Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=2998.62s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defense [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3010.22s)]
*  of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3017.58s)]
*  whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3025.02s)]
*  and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, but wherever [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3032.62s)]
*  this is at stake. Yes. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3041.5s)]
*  Yes. But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3044.86s)]
*  sorry, they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3055.58s)]
*  most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? As you know, there are [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3061.6600000000003s)]
*  colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defense of freedom of religion, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3072.38s)]
*  whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3079.74s)]
*  discriminated against across the world, and this is something for which the President stands for, [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3085.98s)]
*  the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3095.9s)]
*  Other questions? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3104.2999999999997s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3111.3399999999997s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3119.9s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3127.34s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3134.06s)]
*  EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3142.46s)]
*  Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. Is this affecting relations [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3150.06s)]
*  of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations of EU with Kosovo? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3157.98s)]
*  And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. President of Serbia [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3166.3s)]
*  Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. We heard the warnings [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3171.58s)]
*  or suggestions by higher representative that the candidate countries should not participate in that [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3180.22s)]
*  event. So I was wondering whether higher representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3186.46s)]
*  entire commission and what's opinion of President von der Leyen on this and what will be consequences [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3192.62s)]
*  of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event for their relations [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3199.82s)]
*  with European Union or is just a statement that will have no consequences. Thank you. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3206.3s)]
*  I'm going to start Guillaume. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3214.38s)]
*  Yeah, so on Kosovo I would, you know, will not comment on the internal [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3216.54s)]
*  affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries, what I can say. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3224.2999999999997s)]
*  Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to safely forms in institutions. It is very important in terms of [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3231.98s)]
*  achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. It is also important on other issues [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3241.02s)]
*  such as the gross plan. As you know, we need Kosovo parliament to be established in order to [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3252.7799999999997s)]
*  continue the work on this path as well. So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3262.62s)]
*  On your second question, I will quickly give me up. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3271.42s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in and Guillaume made a compliment if necessary. Indeed, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3282.14s)]
*  we have been clear with not only the member states but also our partners and including candidate [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3295.74s)]
*  countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3304.14s)]
*  with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3312.7s)]
*  war of aggression against Ukraine. Anything else there, Guillaume? [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3325.2599999999998s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has applied [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3331.2599999999998s)]
*  and is negotiating for its membership to the EU. The EU wants to count on Serbia as a reliable [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3337.5s)]
*  European partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. We need Serbia to [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3345.82s)]
*  reassure of its strategic direction. So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners including [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3352.14s)]
*  candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned. Relations with Russia cannot be [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3360.14s)]
*  business as usual. Follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. So [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3366.22s)]
*  this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the midday press briefing. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3378.7s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any consequences that, concrete consequences that [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3383.98s)]
*  Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. So if I am getting it right, [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3390.2999999999997s)]
*  Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3398.54s)]
*  We are not saying that there won't be any consequences. It's too early to [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3404.7s)]
*  prejudge. We will not speak later, as you know. And we're talking about an event taking place on [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3408.62s)]
*  9th May. So it's early to tell this. Yes, Cal. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3415.26s)]
*  Same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. Last time I checked, Prime Minister [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3425.02s)]
*  Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9th in Moscow. So is the [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3430.2200000000003s)]
*  commission in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3437.42s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3440.54s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3448.7799999999997s)]
*  and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. And therefore, we defend that we should refrain [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3457.5s)]
*  from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3467.5s)]
*  celebrations in Moscow. And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3477.8199999999997s)]
*  in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3485.2599999999998s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3496.8599999999997s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3504.7799999999997s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3512.8599999999997s)]
*  Saturday, I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3520.7s)]
*  commission to meet the president of the United States, because for me it's not clear from your [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3527.74s)]
*  answer. Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and also [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3536.22s)]
*  internal affairs. After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3547.34s)]
*  personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3554.94s)]
*  is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. We start with Tunisia. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3563.82s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3573.66s)]
*  in Tunisia closely. The EU takes note of the happy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3581.18s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3586.54s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3592.3s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. The rule of law, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3598.62s)]
*  human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3604.8599999999997s)]
*  and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3610.22s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3618.06s)]
*  President von der Leyen's participation in and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3623.98s)]
*  funeral. We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3630.14s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3637.7400000000002s)]
*  change. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3644.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3704.22s)]
*  Yes, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3794.3799999999997s)]
*  Carl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3807.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3824.4599999999996s)]
*  Good. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3827.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3831.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3835.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3839.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3843.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3847.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3851.98s)]
*  Good. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3882.22s)]
*  Good. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3884.22s)]
*  Yes, Carl. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3900.22s)]
*  So, in this sense, we are working and I expect that this will be discussed between the President [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3911.98s)]
*  and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3926.14s)]
*  Yes. [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3930.66s)]
*  I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, but you [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3931.66s)]
*  didn't really answer the question. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3945.5s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3948.22s)]
*  We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump, but is there [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3950.2999999999997s)]
*  an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3954.3399999999997s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you sent now to the White House or isn't there? [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3959.0s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3964.92s)]
*  on Saturday in Rome. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3970.88s)]
*  And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3971.88s)]
*  Jan. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3979.16s)]
*  Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3980.16s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of Commissioner Vekunen, Executive Vice President, to the [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3989.52s)]
*  US following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=3996.2s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4000.7999999999997s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4003.96s)]
*  There are no plans that I can confirm today. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4009.36s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Vekunen is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4013.8s)]
*  be it via letters that you were yourself referring to, or be it with companies, so the engagement [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4019.8s)]
*  is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4025.28s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4030.88s)]
*  Ah, there's one there. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4034.32s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4038.28s)]
*  Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data, user, without [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4040.28s)]
*  consent. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4049.32s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4050.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4054.0800000000004s)]
*  Thomas, what do we know about this? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4055.0800000000004s)]
*  Thanks. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4058.84s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4059.84s)]
*  We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4060.84s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious, I will recall it, that the protection of the data of our [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4066.0s)]
*  citizens is, of course, very important to us, and we're frontrunners in that field, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4071.16s)]
*  so yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4076.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4079.88s)]
*  Any other questions? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4082.8s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either, so I wish you a very good afternoon, and thank [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4083.8s)]
*  you for your participation. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4092.44s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4126.0s)]
*  A short announcement before going into your questions. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4134.36s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today, where she will be meeting Prime [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4139.32s)]
*  Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, organized [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4145.52s)]
*  by the International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4154.68s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, bilateral [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  relations, and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4167.52s)]
*  half of May. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4177.56s)]
*  Today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4179.92s)]
*  reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance of international [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4186.84s)]
*  partnerships in achieving these goals. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4193.12s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS, starting at approximately [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4196.8s)]
*  10 past 3 London time, that's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4204.88s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4215.28s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4219.68s)]
*  Thanks Marla, Christian Eno with NC Europe. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4224.400000000001s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP 30, where the deadline [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4225.68s)]
*  for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4232.48s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4236.5599999999995s)]
*  by September this year? [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4243.679999999999s)]
*  And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4246.2s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer, but given [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4249.0s)]
*  the tight timeline, and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4257.64s)]
*  timeline, can you clarify whether you're counting on a political agreement on the 2040 target [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4265.320000000001s)]
*  before September, or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4270.76s)]
*  I can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4278.76s)]
*  commitments. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4287.16s)]
*  Anna Kaiser, thank you. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4288.360000000001s)]
*  Okay, so yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4293.08s)]
*  a climate law, which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4301.72s)]
*  the NDC. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4307.96s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4308.92s)]
*  the 2040 emission reduction target in that. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4315.799999999999s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4319.16s)]
*  which will cover both the 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4325.08s)]
*  for every 10 years, and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4330.28s)]
*  cycle for NDC updates. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4336.759999999999s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4341.08s)]
*  in good time, well ahead of COP 30, and this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4348.84s)]
*  mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, and then this is a message that [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4355.56s)]
*  we have been passing constantly, and repeatedly that it is our aim to make this presentation, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4360.52s)]
*  this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4368.92s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4373.08s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4377.8s)]
*  presented before summer. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4383.08s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4384.6s)]
*  A follow-up? [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4386.84s)]
*  Thanks, thanks, Paula. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4389.0s)]
*  So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4389.96s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4395.72s)]
*  before presenting the NDC? [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4399.400000000001s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4401.8s)]
*  von der Leyen made any assurances that they will become, the NDC will be coming before September? [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4406.4400000000005s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4410.92s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4417.320000000001s)]
*  and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4422.76s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4426.6s)]
*  in more depth, but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4431.08s)]
*  also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4437.8s)]
*  Any other question to Anna Kaiser? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4442.68s)]
*  Nope. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4444.84s)]
*  Good. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4448.52s)]
*  Then we can move on. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4449.16s)]
*  You had a question here. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4451.08s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4453.8s)]
*  Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4456.12s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4458.4400000000005s)]
*  Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4462.52s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf would engage in [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4465.16s)]
*  meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4469.16s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4472.68s)]
*  But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4473.88s)]
*  Because this would have far reaching implication considering that the number of large and small [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4476.5199999999995s)]
*  organizations that Huawei is a member of. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4482.2s)]
*  So are consultancies, standardization, organization, law firm, for instance, affected as well? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4485.16s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4491.48s)]
*  Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organization [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4493.08s)]
*  that advance the interests of the company specifically and would evaluate that on an [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4496.68s)]
*  ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4500.76s)]
*  My question is how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with the lobby group is [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4503.88s)]
*  designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4507.88s)]
*  One more question, practical. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4510.76s)]
*  Evie Vakunin was supposed to meet with Ektar today, which Huawei is a member of. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4512.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was canceled, sorry. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4516.5199999999995s)]
*  So I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4518.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4521.4s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4522.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4524.92s)]
*  Thank you for your questions. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4525.64s)]
*  And the last one, I don't know, I'll have to check that with... [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4526.52s)]
*  It was canceled, yes, I'm told. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4531.56s)]
*  And if you need more information, we can come back to you on that. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4533.400000000001s)]
*  For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4537.4800000000005s)]
*  longer access Commission officials. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4543.88s)]
*  They can't enter the building. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4545.400000000001s)]
*  It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4547.4800000000005s)]
*  of members, and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4554.84s)]
*  So there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4559.080000000001s)]
*  whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4564.68s)]
*  relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4571.56s)]
*  And that's what we're doing it. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4576.04s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4576.92s)]
*  And if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4578.84s)]
*  then we put a stop to it. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4584.68s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4585.56s)]
*  So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, but we're not [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4586.28s)]
*  going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4593.72s)]
*  Commission. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4599.48s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4599.88s)]
*  meeting proceeds, where we see that there is an issue. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4603.88s)]
*  We look into it in further detail and, as necessary, put a stop to it. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4606.12s)]
*  And that is it. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4609.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4610.36s)]
*  Any other question to Olaf? [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4610.84s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4614.04s)]
*  Hello. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4618.4400000000005s)]
*  Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4619.0s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4623.08s)]
*  sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4628.04s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this decision back then. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4633.4s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4637.96s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4643.32s)]
*  again, or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4648.44s)]
*  in any form? [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4653.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4655.24s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4656.759999999999s)]
*  For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4658.12s)]
*  have been lifted, but Olaf, you can tell us more. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4662.92s)]
*  That's precisely right. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4666.76s)]
*  We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate about what may [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4667.72s)]
*  or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4670.84s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4674.68s)]
*  A follow-up. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4675.56s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4677.4800000000005s)]
*  it was signed, let's say, in a previous time, before many things happened in Europe and [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4682.12s)]
*  around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4687.4800000000005s)]
*  see it as obsolete? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4692.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4694.120000000001s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4696.040000000001s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4699.400000000001s)]
*  Good. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4703.400000000001s)]
*  Any other question to Olaf? [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4703.900000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4708.4400000000005s)]
*  Other topics of interest for today? [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4711.4800000000005s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4714.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4717.320000000001s)]
*  Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4717.88s)]
*  Question maybe for Tomá. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4720.44s)]
*  I would like to ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4722.68s)]
*  on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4730.92s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4738.76s)]
*  Prime Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4745.88s)]
*  of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4750.92s)]
*  in May. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4756.6s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4758.28s)]
*  including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4768.52s)]
*  today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the of the summit later in London in May. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4774.04s)]
*  Yes. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4783.72s)]
*  Yeah, Vitaly. [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4785.8s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UAT. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4789.8s)]
*  Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4793.08s)]
*  I see a reaction of callers. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4795.64s)]
*  And should the Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of Poland, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4797.56s)]
*  he thinks so and give such kind of commentaries. Thank you. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4806.52s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita, [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4812.2s)]
*  following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4820.6s)]
*  Hi, are you? [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4827.0s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4831.64s)]
*  Ah, sorry. Hi. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4833.0s)]
*  As you said, the HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4836.84s)]
*  What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4848.36s)]
*  We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4853.4s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4857.719999999999s)]
*  Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4866.759999999999s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4871.08s)]
*  our position on the peace talks, but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4877.08s)]
*  Our position is really clear here. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4882.36s)]
*  Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4884.76s)]
*  about Ukraine without Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4889.88s)]
*  And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4897.8s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4905.08s)]
*  Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4912.92s)]
*  Yes, please. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4918.5199999999995s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but foreign affairs. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4923.24s)]
*  On the situation in Kashmir, we've seen the president's tweet about it, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4926.2s)]
*  but how concerned is the commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4929.8s)]
*  Yes, Guillaume. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4933.48s)]
*  Indeed. As you said, the president has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4938.759999999999s)]
*  situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for a peaceful [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4945.799999999999s)]
*  solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4952.919999999999s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4958.84s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4967.32s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4972.76s)]
*  commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4978.6s)]
*  Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4983.8s)]
*  the two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4988.12s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=4997.8s)]
*  principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5002.76s)]
*  of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. These are the [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5010.44s)]
*  principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5017.24s)]
*  circumstances. Yes. Thank you very much, Silvia. Besides reiterating the position, is there any [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5024.679999999999s)]
*  chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5036.04s)]
*  White House? I mean, there are several meetings in the next days and there are [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5042.76s)]
*  points also in Rome where everybody will be there. Do you think there's a possibility to [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5048.44s)]
*  talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? We're looking into possibilities to meet, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5055.0s)]
*  as you know. Nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5062.28s)]
*  but we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5069.88s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Arad, RG News Agency, Italy. That means that you are trying to meet President [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5080.759999999999s)]
*  Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. The objective in Rome is really [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5087.16s)]
*  the mourning of Pope Francis. That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5098.68s)]
*  in Rome. If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of the funeral, then [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5106.36s)]
*  they will be, of course, seized. But the main objective is obviously the participation of the [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5115.24s)]
*  President at the funeral of Pope Francis. Any other questions? Yes, Anna. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5122.04s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5136.12s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5142.04s)]
*  of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? Because in this century, 62,000 [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5147.16s)]
*  Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5155.48s)]
*  religious extremists. So my question is, because Madam President will be there, [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5161.719999999999s)]
*  would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5166.2s)]
*  because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5171.24s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defense [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5181.08s)]
*  of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5188.44s)]
*  whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5195.8s)]
*  and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world and not just in Nigeria, but wherever [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5203.400000000001s)]
*  this is at stake. Yes. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5212.28s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5216.04s)]
*  sorry, they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5221.96s)]
*  the most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? [[01:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5227.88s)]
*  As you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working on the issue of human rights, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5234.200000000001s)]
*  in the Commission working precisely on the defense of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5243.799999999999s)]
*  be, and we have several which in different contexts are being discriminated against across [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5252.04s)]
*  the world, and this is something for which the President stands for, the expression of freedom [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5259.16s)]
*  of religion, whatever that religion may be. Other questions? [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5269.32s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5282.2s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5290.759999999999s)]
*  Okay, then I have Augustin Palokai. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5295.0s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5304.84s)]
*  EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5313.32s)]
*  Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. Is this [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5320.92s)]
*  affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in the [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5327.72s)]
*  relations of EU with Kosovo? And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5335.4s)]
*  you. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5340.6s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by higher representative that the candidate countries [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5348.12s)]
*  should not participate in that event. So I was wondering whether higher representative Kalas was [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5355.799999999999s)]
*  speaking on behalf of entire commission and what's opinion of President von der Leyen on this and [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5362.28s)]
*  what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5369.0s)]
*  for their relations with European Union or is just a statement that [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5375.96s)]
*  will have no consequences. Thank you. I'm going to start Guillaume. Yeah, so on Kosovo I would, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5381.879999999999s)]
*  you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5391.4s)]
*  for any other partner countries, what I can say. Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to safely [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5399.32s)]
*  forms in institutions. It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5407.0s)]
*  moving forward on this path. It is also important on other issues such as the growth plan. As you [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5415.16s)]
*  know, we need Kosovo parliament to be established in order to continue the work on this path as well. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5426.04s)]
*  So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. On your second question, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5437.64s)]
*  I will quickly give me up. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5446.6s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in and Guillaume, you may then complement if necessary. Indeed, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5456.04s)]
*  we have been clear with not only the member states but also our partners and including candidate [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5466.6s)]
*  countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5474.92s)]
*  with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5482.04s)]
*  unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. Anything else there, Guillaume? [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5493.32s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5502.12s)]
*  applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU and the EU wants to count on Serbia [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5507.72s)]
*  as a reliable partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. We need [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5515.400000000001s)]
*  Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners, [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5522.360000000001s)]
*  including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned. Relations with Russia cannot be [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5530.6s)]
*  business as usual. Follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. So [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5537.08s)]
*  this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the midday press briefing. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5549.48s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any consequences, concrete consequences that Serbia [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5554.84s)]
*  could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. So if I am getting it right, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5561.64s)]
*  Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5569.320000000001s)]
*  We are not saying there won't be any consequences. It's too early to [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5575.4800000000005s)]
*  pre-judge. We will not speak later, as you know. And we're talking about an event taking place on [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5579.4800000000005s)]
*  9th May, so it's early to tell at this stage. Yes, Karl. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5586.120000000001s)]
*  Yeah, same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. Last time I checked, Prime Minister [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5595.320000000001s)]
*  Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. So is the Commission [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5601.080000000001s)]
*  in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5608.68s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5614.12s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5619.56s)]
*  and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. And therefore, we defend that we should refrain [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5628.280000000001s)]
*  from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5638.28s)]
*  celebrations in Moscow. And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5648.599999999999s)]
*  in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5656.04s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5667.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5675.639999999999s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5683.719999999999s)]
*  Saturday, I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5691.56s)]
*  commission to meet the president of the United States, because for me it's not clear from your [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5698.6s)]
*  answer. The second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5707.080000000001s)]
*  also internal affairs. After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5717.4s)]
*  personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5725.799999999999s)]
*  is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. We start with Tunisia. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5734.679999999999s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5744.52s)]
*  in Tunisia closely. The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5752.04s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5757.400000000001s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5763.16s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. The rule of law, [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5769.4800000000005s)]
*  human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5775.72s)]
*  and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5781.08s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5788.92s)]
*  President von der Leyen's participation in and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5794.84s)]
*  funeral. We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5801.0s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5808.6s)]
*  change. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5815.08s)]
*  Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=5965.08s)]
*  Yes, Carl. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6055.08s)]
*  Yes. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6085.08s)]
*  I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, but you didn't really [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6105.5599999999995s)]
*  answer the question. It's about the visit in Rome. We understand that you take the opportunity, [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6116.759999999999s)]
*  if there is some, to meet Trump, but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6122.679999999999s)]
*  to meet Trump? Is there any official thing that you send now to the White House or isn't there? [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6128.599999999999s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6135.4s)]
*  Saturday in Rome. And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6141.719999999999s)]
*  share with you. Jen. [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6148.12s)]
*  John, Bloomberg News. Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. Is there any [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6154.12s)]
*  imminent visit of Commissioner of the Kuhnen executive as president to the US following the [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6161.4800000000005s)]
*  footsteps of other commissioners? And if so, who is she going to meet? [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6169.08s)]
*  Are we aware of such plans for the no plans that I can that I can confirm today? I can just recall [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6176.52s)]
*  that Evie Birkund is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, be it by lectures that [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6185.56s)]
*  you were yourself referring to, or be it with companies. So the engagement is obviously there, [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6191.72s)]
*  but I cannot confirm visit today. I don't see any other questions. There's one there. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6197.080000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6207.32s)]
*  Thank you. Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data, user, [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6210.2s)]
*  without consent. Is the EU looking into that? Thank you. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6219.72s)]
*  What we know about this. Thanks. Yes, we are. We're actively looking also and monitoring [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6228.04s)]
*  developments in the field of AI. Of course, I mean, it's obvious, I will recall it that the [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6234.28s)]
*  protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us and we're front runners [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6240.2s)]
*  in that field. So yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6246.5199999999995s)]
*  Any other questions? No, I don't see online questions either. So I wish you a very good [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6253.4s)]
*  afternoon and thank you for your participation. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6261.08s)]
*  Okay. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6291.16s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. A short announcement before going [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6299.4s)]
*  into your questions. As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today where she will be [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6308.12s)]
*  meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6315.4s)]
*  organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. This will be [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6323.879999999999s)]
*  an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, bilateral relations, [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6330.759999999999s)]
*  and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6338.92s)]
*  May. At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6349.0s)]
*  advance reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance of international [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6356.84s)]
*  partnerships in achieving these goals. I would like to invite you to follow the President's [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6363.64s)]
*  speech live on EBS starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. That's 10 past 4 here in [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6371.0s)]
*  Brussels. And with this, we may move on to your questions. Yes, Christian. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6384.280000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. Christian with NC Europe. I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6394.6s)]
*  yesterday on COP 30 where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6398.360000000001s)]
*  was discussed. Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6405.8s)]
*  present its NDC by September this year? And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6412.52s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6419.64s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6426.12s)]
*  given the tight timeline, can you clarify whether you're counting on a political agreement on the [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6434.12s)]
*  2040 target before September or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[01:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6440.12s)]
*  Ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6449.64s)]
*  Anna Kaiser, thank you. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6459.72s)]
*  Okay, so yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6464.68s)]
*  a climate law, which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the [[01:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6472.200000000001s)]
*  NDC. So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law and we [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6478.68s)]
*  will include the 2040 emissions reduction target in that. And then once this is agreed, [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6485.64s)]
*  the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, which will cover both the 2040, [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6491.48s)]
*  because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, and a figure for 2035, [[01:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6498.2s)]
*  which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. And to repeat what we have [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6504.44s)]
*  had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6514.44s)]
*  COP 30. And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6521.639999999999s)]
*  a couple of weeks ago, and then this is a message that we have been passing [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6528.76s)]
*  constantly and repeatedly that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6532.5199999999995s)]
*  next NDC in good time ahead of COP. I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6540.599999999999s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6548.44s)]
*  which will be presented before summer. Yes, Christian, a follow-up? [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6553.16s)]
*  Thanks, thanks, Paula. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6559.5599999999995s)]
*  once agreed. Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6565.639999999999s)]
*  before presenting the NDC? And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6569.96s)]
*  whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[01:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6575.32s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. The first step is to [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6581.48s)]
*  present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6589.48s)]
*  next steps from there on. And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6593.96s)]
*  has been discussed in more depth, but we can confirm that we abide by our international [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6600.759999999999s)]
*  commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. Any other question to Anna Kaiser? No? [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6606.68s)]
*  Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6619.08s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6624.360000000001s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6629.0s)]
*  Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. And that would include any intermediaries acting [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6633.08s)]
*  on Huawei's behalf who would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6637.72s)]
*  advance the interests of the company. Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6641.72s)]
*  exactly you draw the line? Because this would have far-reaching implications considering that [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6646.04s)]
*  the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. So are consultancies, [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6651.48s)]
*  standardization, organization, law firm, for instance, affected as well? [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6657.48s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the [[01:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6661.72s)]
*  Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6665.08s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. My question is, [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6669.96s)]
*  how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6675.0s)]
*  the interests of Huawei in particular? One more question, practical. Evy V. Rekunin was supposed [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6679.64s)]
*  to meet with Ektar today, which Huawei is a member of. So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6684.280000000001s)]
*  canceled, so I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6688.6s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. On the last one, I don't know, [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6693.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll have to check that with... It was canceled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6698.280000000001s)]
*  we can come back to you on that. For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6706.4400000000005s)]
*  representatives can no longer access Commission officials. They can't enter the building. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6712.92s)]
*  And it is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6717.0s)]
*  of members, and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. So, [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6724.92s)]
*  there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6730.44s)]
*  whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization relates to [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6734.52s)]
*  to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. And that's what we're doing it. So we're doing it [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6742.5199999999995s)]
*  on an ad hoc basis. And if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6747.88s)]
*  direction, then we put a stop to it. It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6754.759999999999s)]
*  know, a kind of a protected space, but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6761.0s)]
*  their important work meeting the European Commission. So we look at each case on an ad [[01:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6767.32s)]
*  hoc basis. And where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. Where we see that [[01:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6771.799999999999s)]
*  there is an issue, we look into it in further detail and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6775.799999999999s)]
*  And that is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Kharagin. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6779.5599999999995s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6789.0s)]
*  Yesterday, we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6793.64s)]
*  sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. Obviously, I remember that the Commission [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6798.6s)]
*  criticized this decision back then. The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6805.8s)]
*  China and the European Union. Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6812.12s)]
*  put on the table again? Or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6818.12s)]
*  brought back in any form? Thank you. Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6823.8s)]
*  we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted. But, Olaf, [[01:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6830.599999999999s)]
*  you can tell us more. That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation. So we're [[01:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6835.48s)]
*  not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. Yes, Kharagin. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6840.04s)]
*  A follow-up. Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6846.2s)]
*  because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time before many things happened in Europe and [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6852.44s)]
*  around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6858.12s)]
*  obsolete? Thank you. Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6863.8s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olaf? [[01:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6870.04s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6876.2s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6887.8s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6893.24s)]
*  EU-UK summit on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6900.12s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6909.32s)]
*  Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that [[01:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6916.679999999999s)]
*  bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6921.799999999999s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6927.64s)]
*  including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6938.200000000001s)]
*  meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6944.280000000001s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, Vitaly. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6949.72s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kyiv? I see reaction of [[01:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6960.360000000001s)]
*  colors. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6967.08s)]
*  Poland, he thinks so, and give such kind of commentaries? Thank you. Yes, and Joom will take [[01:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6976.36s)]
*  up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6986.12s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. Sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIVP has just published a social media post on [[01:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=6994.92s)]
*  the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks [[01:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7014.28s)]
*  on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kyiv and other cities last night. [[01:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7023.0s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. Russia [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7028.2s)]
*  is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. Regarding your second questions on [[01:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7037.64s)]
*  possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, [[01:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7043.72s)]
*  but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7049.0s)]
*  the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine without [[01:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7056.12s)]
*  Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. And upholding Ukraine's [[01:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7063.96s)]
*  independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. Absolutely. And we reiterate those [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7070.84s)]
*  principles also under the current circumstances and developments. Any other questions to Guillaume [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7077.72s)]
*  with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[01:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7085.72s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7093.8s)]
*  we've seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the Commission about a potential [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7098.12s)]
*  escalation in the region? Indeed, as you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7102.84s)]
*  social media post on the situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7114.6s)]
*  underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7121.96s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[01:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7129.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7137.88s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the [[01:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7143.320000000001s)]
*  Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7149.160000000001s)]
*  Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7154.36s)]
*  the two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7158.679999999999s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7168.36s)]
*  principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement [[01:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7173.32s)]
*  of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. These are the [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7181.0s)]
*  principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7187.8s)]
*  circumstances. Yes. Thank you very much, Silvia. Besides reiterating the position, [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7195.24s)]
*  is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7205.88s)]
*  directly to the White House? I mean, there are several meetings in the next days and [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7212.2s)]
*  points also Rome where everybody will be there. Do you think there's a possibility to [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7219.0s)]
*  talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? We're looking into possibilities to meet, [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7225.5599999999995s)]
*  as you know. Nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7232.84s)]
*  but we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7240.4400000000005s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Arad, RG News Agency, Italy. That means that you are trying to meet [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7251.32s)]
*  President Trump in Rome? Are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7257.240000000001s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. That is the main [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7266.040000000001s)]
*  objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. If other opportunities arise in the [[02:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7273.4800000000005s)]
*  context, in the margins of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. But the main [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7280.84s)]
*  objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7289.56s)]
*  Any other questions? Yes, Hannah. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7299.32s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[02:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7301.4s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7312.599999999999s)]
*  European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7318.04s)]
*  Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and religious extremists. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7326.68s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7333.64s)]
*  to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7339.320000000001s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defense [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7344.76s)]
*  of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7359.0s)]
*  whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7366.4400000000005s)]
*  and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world and not just in Nigeria, [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7374.04s)]
*  but wherever this is at stake. Yes. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7381.64s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7390.92s)]
*  sorry, they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7397.0s)]
*  most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? As you know, there are [[02:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7403.0s)]
*  colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defense of freedom of religion, [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7413.8s)]
*  whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7421.08s)]
*  discriminated against across the world, and this is something for which the President stands for, [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7427.4s)]
*  the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. Other questions? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7436.5199999999995s)]
*  Questions? [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7446.44s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7452.759999999999s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7461.24s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7468.759999999999s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7472.44s)]
*  EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7480.599999999999s)]
*  Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. Is this [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7488.2s)]
*  affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo? [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7495.16s)]
*  Affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7498.2s)]
*  of EU with Kosovo? And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7506.44s)]
*  President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7511.64s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by higher representatives that candidate countries should [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7519.4s)]
*  not participate in that event. So I was wondering whether higher representative Kalas was speaking [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7526.6s)]
*  on behalf of the entire Commission and what's the opinion of President von der Leyen on this? And [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7533.240000000001s)]
*  what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7539.56s)]
*  for their relations with European Union? Or is it just a statement that [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7546.52s)]
*  will have no consequences? Thank you. [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7552.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm going to start, Liam. [[02:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7555.32s)]
*  Yeah. So on Kosovo, I would, you know, will not comment on the internal [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7557.639999999999s)]
*  affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries. But I can say, [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7565.719999999999s)]
*  indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to swiftly forms in institutions, it is very important in terms of [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7573.4s)]
*  achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. It is also important on other issues [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7582.44s)]
*  such as the growth plan. As you know, we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7594.12s)]
*  continue the work on this path as well. So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7603.88s)]
*  On your second question, I will quickly give me up. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7612.84s)]
*  Okay. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7618.68s)]
*  Yes. Well, I can already come in and Kjom, you may then complement if necessary. Indeed, [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7628.92s)]
*  we have been clear with not only the member states, but also our partners and including candidate [[02:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7637.160000000001s)]
*  countries such as Serbia, that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7645.4800000000005s)]
*  with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7654.12s)]
*  war of aggression against Ukraine. Anything else there, Kjom? [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7666.68s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week, precisely on this issue, that Serbia has [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7672.68s)]
*  applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU and the EU wants to count on Serbia [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7678.360000000001s)]
*  as a reliable European partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7685.96s)]
*  And we need Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. So the EU has been crystal clear [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7692.04s)]
*  with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, [[02:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7698.68s)]
*  relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7703.96s)]
*  Good. Yeah. [[02:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7709.96s)]
*  A follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. So this is the second time this topic [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7713.96s)]
*  has been opened here at the midday press briefing. And like the first time, we don't hear any [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7721.8s)]
*  concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. So if I am [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7727.16s)]
*  getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[02:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7734.76s)]
*  We are not saying that there won't be any consequences. It's too early to prejudge. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7743.0s)]
*  We will not speak later, as you know. And we're talking about even taking place on the 9th of [[02:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7747.4s)]
*  May. So it's early to tell at this stage. Yes, Carl. [[02:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7754.2s)]
*  Yeah, same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. Last time I checked, Prime Minister [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7765.88s)]
*  Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. So is the commission [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7771.64s)]
*  in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[02:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7779.48s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7784.679999999999s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7790.12s)]
*  and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. And therefore, we defend that we should refrain [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7798.839999999999s)]
*  from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May [[02:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7808.84s)]
*  celebrations in Moscow. And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7819.16s)]
*  in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[02:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7826.6s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7838.28s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7846.2s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7854.28s)]
*  I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7863.16s)]
*  to meet the president of the United States, because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7870.04s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7879.8s)]
*  also internal affairs. After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, [[02:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7887.96s)]
*  personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7896.36s)]
*  is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. We start with Tunisia. [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7905.24s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7915.08s)]
*  in Tunisia closely. The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[02:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7922.599999999999s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7927.96s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7933.719999999999s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. The rule of law, [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7940.04s)]
*  human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution [[02:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7946.28s)]
*  and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7951.639999999999s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective, obviously, of [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7959.48s)]
*  present on the lines participation in and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7965.4s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7972.28s)]
*  short bilateral meetings. For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, [[02:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7977.32s)]
*  but we will keep you posted should it change. Tomaso is online. [[02:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7983.719999999999s)]
*  Yes, good morning. Thomas Gallowate from the Italian press agency. It's only a question on defense, [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=7995.4s)]
*  because yesterday the European Parliament's European Commission approved the life of the [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8008.44s)]
*  legal process, according to which the safe proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8016.6s)]
*  Article 122, at least for part of the proposal. I would like to know how the Commission [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8027.64s)]
*  will proceed. If you want to modify the proposal, perhaps by dividing it in two parts, [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8037.56s)]
*  how to suggest the Parliament's hopes, or if you want to proceed without an amendment. Thank you. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8048.6s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, Thomas. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8058.6s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. We are of course aware and calm of what has been reported in the press. [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8061.72s)]
*  I will not comment on this. Just to remind you, in a more global way, that today, [[02:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8067.5599999999995s)]
*  we have a risk for our security that is real. And that is why the Commission [[02:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8073.96s)]
*  actually proposed this new instrument for safe defense, which will allow the Member States to [[02:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8079.32s)]
*  make joint purchases in defense. This instrument is actually established on Article 122. [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8084.6s)]
*  Allow me to remind you that in the presidential guidelines and political guidelines, [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8094.280000000001s)]
*  the President reminded us that Article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances, [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8099.56s)]
*  like the one we are currently living in. In the previous mandate, this Article 122 [[02:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8104.76s)]
*  has already been activated, also for exceptional circumstances. Let me remind you of the pandemic, [[02:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8112.28s)]
*  the Covid, or the gas price period, where this instrument was activated. [[02:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8118.5199999999995s)]
*  The Commission remains of course on its proposed proposal, which was established. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8125.48s)]
*  Today, it is up to the Member States to agree. I think the Commission has always been [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8131.32s)]
*  ready to make these choices. I just did it here, but we are of course ready to do it [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8136.04s)]
*  with other institutions. [[02:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8143.72s)]
*  Thank you, Thomas. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8145.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas? Good. [[02:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8147.400000000001s)]
*  Yes, this morning, the Commission of the Industry and the European Parliament's [[02:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8153.400000000001s)]
*  Defense Committee voted on the EDIP program, which provides eligibility conditions [[02:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8159.400000000001s)]
*  with a European preference, so 70% of European components. What is the Commission's [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8166.6s)]
*  reaction to this adoption? And now the question that arises is the inclusion of the [[02:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8172.4400000000005s)]
*  potential of the United Kingdom in this program. Did the Commission send proposals to the Member States [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8177.88s)]
*  and the Parliament on this subject? And does the President want to speak to Mr. Starmer [[02:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8185.08s)]
*  today? [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8189.799999999999s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I leave it to Paula. I have no specific comment to [[02:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8191.799999999999s)]
*  make on what is currently happening in Parliament or on a proposal. I can remind you [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8201.32s)]
*  that I just spoke in the previous answer and from SAFE that the proposal we made, there [[02:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8205.8s)]
*  is a European purchase clause that is set at 65%. I also want to remind you that the [[02:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8210.44s)]
*  United Kingdom can already participate at a 35% rate in this program when it is actually [[02:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8216.76s)]
*  implemented. In general, we are working closely with third-party states that share our [[02:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8222.76s)]
*  views and that are very close to us, including the United Kingdom. So we are working closely [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8228.76s)]
*  with the United Kingdom. [[02:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8234.76s)]
*  Yes, Carl. So for a participation of the United Kingdom at SAFE, as you know, it is first [[02:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8239.08s)]
*  a, I don't know if we say it, a dedicated partnership. And so it is also in this sense [[02:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8247.08s)]
*  that we are working and I expect that it will indeed be discussed between the President [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8257.08s)]
*  and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8267.4s)]
*  Yes. [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8275.4s)]
*  Antoine Fomagali for Neue Zücherzeitung. I'm sorry to come back to the question that was [[02:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8279.4s)]
*  asked before online by David, but you didn't really answer the question. It's about the [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8283.4s)]
*  visit in Rome. We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8289.4s)]
*  Trump, but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8294.76s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you send now to the White House or isn't there? [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8300.2s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8305.960000000001s)]
*  Saturday in Rome. And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8312.28s)]
*  share with you. Jen. [[02:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8318.68s)]
*  John V. Bloomberg News. Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. Is there any [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8324.68s)]
*  imminent visit of Commissioner of the Kuhnen, Executive Vice President, to the US, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8331.960000000001s)]
*  following the footsteps of other commissioners? And if so, who is she going to meet? [[02:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8339.0s)]
*  Are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8347.0s)]
*  No plans that I can confirm today. I can just recall that EDP Vierkuhnen is, of course, [[02:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8350.6s)]
*  engaging with her American counterparts, be it via letters that you were yourself referring to, [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8357.880000000001s)]
*  or be it with companies. So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[02:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8363.880000000001s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. There's one there. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8372.12s)]
*  Thank you. Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data, user, [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8380.76s)]
*  without consent. Is the EU looking into that? Thank you. [[02:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8390.28s)]
*  What do we know about this? Thanks. Yes, we are. We're actively [[02:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8398.52s)]
*  looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. Of course, I mean, it's obvious, [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8402.92s)]
*  I will recall it, that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to [[02:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8409.24s)]
*  us, and we are front runners in that field. So yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8415.24s)]
*  Any other questions? No, I don't see online questions either. So I wish you [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8423.88s)]
*  a very good afternoon, and thank you for your participation. [[02:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8430.36s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. A short announcement [[02:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8460.36s)]
*  before going into your questions. As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today, [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8478.2s)]
*  where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of [[02:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8485.32s)]
*  energy security, organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[02:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8493.32s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8500.6s)]
*  bilateral relations, and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8508.36s)]
*  second half of May. At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's [[02:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8518.52s)]
*  efforts to advance reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance [[02:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8527.08s)]
*  of international partnerships in achieving these goals. I would like to invite you to follow the [[02:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8533.56s)]
*  President's speech live on EBS, starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. That's [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8541.4s)]
*  10 past 4 here in Brussels. And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8552.359999999999s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[02:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8561.08s)]
*  Thanks, Marla. Christian Enyer with NC Europe. I have a question on yesterday's, von der Leyen's call yesterday on [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8565.08s)]
*  COP 30, where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[02:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8571.0s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8577.720000000001s)]
*  by September this year? And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8584.92s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[02:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8590.52s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8596.92s)]
*  timeline, can you clarify whether you're counting in a political agreement on the 2040 target [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8606.68s)]
*  before September, or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8612.12s)]
*  I can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[02:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8619.800000000001s)]
*  Anna Kaiser, thank you. [[02:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8630.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8633.96s)]
*  Okay, so yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, [[02:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8635.96s)]
*  which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. So first is that we [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8644.68s)]
*  make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include the 2040 emission reduction [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8651.72s)]
*  target in that. And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next [[02:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8659.0s)]
*  NDC, which will cover both the 20 to 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8665.32s)]
*  we do this for over 10 years, and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8671.24s)]
*  Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, [[02:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8677.4s)]
*  we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. And this is something that [[02:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8687.0s)]
*  Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, and then [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8695.08s)]
*  this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly that it is our aim [[02:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8701.16s)]
*  to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8707.56s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8714.519999999999s)]
*  the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8720.92s)]
*  Yes, Christian, a follow-up? [[02:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8727.56s)]
*  Thanks, thanks, Carla. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come, [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8730.359999999999s)]
*  once agreed. Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8736.439999999999s)]
*  before presenting the NDC? And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8740.76s)]
*  whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8746.2s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. The first step is to [[02:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8753.56s)]
*  present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the [[02:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8760.36s)]
*  next steps from there on. And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8764.84s)]
*  has been discussed in more depth, but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments, [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8771.64s)]
*  also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. Any other questions to Anna Kaiser? No? [[02:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8779.24s)]
*  Good, then we can move on. You had a question here. [[02:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8789.960000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[02:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8795.24s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8799.8s)]
*  Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf, and that would include any intermediaries acting [[02:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8803.960000000001s)]
*  on Huawei's behalf who would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to [[02:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8808.52s)]
*  advance the interests of the company. Sorry for the long quote, but can you please clarify why [[02:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8812.52s)]
*  exactly you draw the line? Because this would have far-reaching implications considering that [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8816.84s)]
*  the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. So are consultancies, [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8822.279999999999s)]
*  standardization, organization, law firm, for instance, affected as well? I've got a couple [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8828.279999999999s)]
*  more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8833.48s)]
*  with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically and would evaluate [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8836.599999999999s)]
*  that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. My question is, how can the [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8841.64s)]
*  Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests [[02:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8846.199999999999s)]
*  of Huawei in particular? One more question, practical. Evie Verkounen was supposed to meet [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8851.0s)]
*  with Ecta today, which Huawei is a member of, so I'm just wondering, and the meeting was cancelled, [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8855.88s)]
*  sorry, so I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8859.8s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. On the last one, I don't know, [[02:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8864.36s)]
*  I'll have to check that with... It was cancelled, yes, I'm told, and we'll, if you need more [[02:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8869.16s)]
*  information, we can come back to you on that. For everything else, look, we've made very clear that [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8875.96s)]
*  Huawei representatives can no longer access Commission officials, they can't enter the building. [[02:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8882.759999999998s)]
*  It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of [[02:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8888.919999999998s)]
*  members, and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. So, [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8896.359999999999s)]
*  there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8902.039999999999s)]
*  whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8906.279999999999s)]
*  relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not, and that's what we're doing it. So, [[02:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8913.0s)]
*  we're doing it on an ad hoc basis, and if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8918.439999999999s)]
*  go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. It's as simple as that. So, we're making sure [[02:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8925.16s)]
*  that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, but we're not going to stop umbrella [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8929.56s)]
*  organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. So, we look at [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8936.76s)]
*  each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8941.72s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail, and as necessary, put a stop [[02:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8945.96s)]
*  to it. That is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Kharaghaim. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8950.199999999999s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. Yesterday, [[02:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8959.88s)]
*  we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8964.92s)]
*  Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this [[02:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8970.279999999999s)]
*  decision back then. The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China [[02:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8977.48s)]
*  and the European Union. Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered [[02:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8983.24s)]
*  or put on the table again, or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be [[02:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8988.68s)]
*  brought back in any form? Thank you. Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=8994.6s)]
*  we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted, [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9001.4s)]
*  but Olaf, you can tell us more. That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, [[02:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9005.56s)]
*  so we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[02:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9010.52s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. A follow-up. Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, [[02:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9014.44s)]
*  do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time, [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9021.960000000001s)]
*  before many things happened in Europe and around the world, do you think this text is still [[02:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9026.44s)]
*  up-to-date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9031.720000000001s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9037.4s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olaf? No. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9039.08s)]
*  Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9052.84s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[02:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9058.68s)]
*  I would like to ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK Summit on the [[02:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9064.039999999999s)]
*  19th of May regarding especially the potential defence deal. Well, on this one, as I mentioned [[02:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9072.6s)]
*  at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today, also in a bilateral [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9083.4s)]
*  setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, [[02:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9090.2s)]
*  to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. This is very much unique in the past years, [[02:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9094.36s)]
*  so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, and that's as [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9106.2s)]
*  much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation [[02:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9113.0s)]
*  of the summit later in London in May. Yes. Yeah, Vitaly. [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9118.199999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9131.16s)]
*  of callous. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9137.8s)]
*  of Poland thinks so and gives such kind of commentary? Thank you. Yes, and Joom will take [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9147.0s)]
*  up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9156.92s)]
*  Hi. Are you? Yes, Vitaly is there. Sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIVP has just published a social [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9165.72s)]
*  media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9183.56s)]
*  attacks on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[02:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9193.24s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. Russia [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9199.0s)]
*  is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. Regarding your second questions on [[02:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9208.44s)]
*  possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, but I'm [[02:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9214.6s)]
*  happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is the one to [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9220.12s)]
*  decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine [[02:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9227.480000000001s)]
*  and nothing about the EU without the EU. And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty, [[02:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9235.640000000001s)]
*  and territorial integrity is crucial. Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also. [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9243.160000000002s)]
*  The current circumstances and developments. Any other questions to Guillaume with his various [[02:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9250.28s)]
*  hats today? Yes, please. Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not Ukraine but foreign affairs. On the [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9257.880000000001s)]
*  situation in Kashmir, we've seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9267.800000000001s)]
*  Commission about a potential escalation in the region? Indeed, as you said, the President has [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9272.12s)]
*  published a social media post on the situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9284.92s)]
*  underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[02:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9292.84s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[02:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9303.24s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[02:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9308.76s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9314.2s)]
*  Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9320.04s)]
*  Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the [[02:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9325.240000000002s)]
*  two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[02:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9329.640000000001s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9339.160000000002s)]
*  principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement [[02:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9344.2s)]
*  of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. These are the principles [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9351.880000000001s)]
*  that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. [[02:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9359.16s)]
*  Yes. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9368.04s)]
*  Thank you very much. Silvia Yusuf from El País. Besides reiterating the position, [[02:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9369.34s)]
*  is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9376.7s)]
*  directly to the White House? I mean, is there, there are several meetings this in the next [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9383.02s)]
*  day, days, and where points also roam where everybody will be there. Do you think it's, [[02:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9387.980000000001s)]
*  there's a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? [[02:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9394.06s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet, as you know. Nothing is confirmed for the moment, [[02:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9401.019999999999s)]
*  so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, but we'll keep you posted if that should be the, [[02:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9405.66s)]
*  that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9414.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you. Ibrahim Marad, AG News Agency, Italy. That means that you are trying to meet [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9419.26s)]
*  President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9428.06s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. That is the main objective of [[02:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9436.86s)]
*  President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. If other opportunities arise in the context, [[02:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9445.82s)]
*  in the margins of that, of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. But the main objective [[02:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9452.14s)]
*  is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. Any other questions? [[02:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9460.94s)]
*  Yes, Anna. [[02:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9471.74s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[02:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9476.22s)]
*  And in this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of [[02:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9483.1s)]
*  the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? Because in this century, 62,000 [[02:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9488.779999999999s)]
*  Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kind of group of political extremists and religious [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9496.94s)]
*  extremists. So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake [[02:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9503.74s)]
*  any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, [[02:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9509.18s)]
*  and also worldwide? Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by [[02:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9514.38s)]
*  the defence of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression [[02:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9529.34s)]
*  of religion, whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, [[02:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9536.380000000001s)]
*  the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9543.98s)]
*  but wherever this is at stake. Yes. [[02:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9552.46s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because [[02:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9561.74s)]
*  sorry, they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9567.82s)]
*  most persecuted. So if she would pay special attention to them? [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9573.82s)]
*  Madam President, as you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the [[02:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9578.06s)]
*  defence of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9588.859999999999s)]
*  different contexts are being discriminated against across the world, and this is something for which [[02:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9596.3s)]
*  the President stands for, the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[02:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9605.58s)]
*  Other questions? [[02:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9616.54s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[02:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9623.58s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[02:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9632.14s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9639.58s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if [[02:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9646.22s)]
*  EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the [[02:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9654.699999999999s)]
*  Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. Is this affecting relations [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9662.3s)]
*  of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations of EU with Kosovo? [[02:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9670.22s)]
*  And I have a second question related to that, maybe for both of you. President of Serbia, [[02:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9678.539999999999s)]
*  Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9683.82s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by the higher representative that candidate countries [[02:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9690.3s)]
*  should not participate in that event. So I was wondering whether the higher representative [[02:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9697.26s)]
*  Kalas was speaking on behalf of the entire commission, and what's the opinion of President [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9703.1s)]
*  von der Leyen on this, and what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of [[02:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9708.7s)]
*  Serbia in this event for their relations with European Union, or is just a statement that [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9715.66s)]
*  will have no consequences? Thank you. I'm going to start Guillaume. Yeah, so on Kosovo I would, [[02:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9723.34s)]
*  you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do [[02:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9732.86s)]
*  for any other partner countries, what I can say. Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to safely [[02:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9740.7s)]
*  forms in institutions. It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and [[02:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9748.460000000001s)]
*  moving forward on this path. It is also important on other issues, such as the growth plan. [[02:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9756.54s)]
*  As you know, we need Kosovo parliament to be established in order to continue the work on [[02:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9767.1s)]
*  this path as well. So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. On your second question, [[02:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9776.380000000001s)]
*  I'll only quickly give me up. [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9786.78s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in, and Guillaume, you may then compliment if necessary. Indeed, [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9799.740000000002s)]
*  we have been clear with not only the member states, but also our partners, and including [[02:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9807.980000000001s)]
*  candidate countries such as Serbia, that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual [[02:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9815.1s)]
*  with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the [[02:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9824.94s)]
*  unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. Anything else there, Guillaume? [[02:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9834.7s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has [[02:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9843.5s)]
*  applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU, and the EU wants to count on Serbia [[02:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9849.18s)]
*  as a reliable European partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. [[02:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9856.78s)]
*  We need Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. So the EU has been crystal clear [[02:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9862.94s)]
*  with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9869.5s)]
*  relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[02:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9874.46s)]
*  A follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. So this is the second time this topic [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9884.54s)]
*  has been opened here at the media press briefing, and like the first time, we don't hear any [[02:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9892.3s)]
*  concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. So if I am [[02:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9897.98s)]
*  getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9905.58s)]
*  We are not saying that there won't be any consequences. It's too early to prejudge. We [[02:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9914.06s)]
*  will not speak later, as you know, and we're talking about an event taking place on the 9th of [[02:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9918.699999999999s)]
*  May, so it's early to tell this stage. Yes, Cal. [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9925.1s)]
*  Yeah, same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. Last time I checked, Prime Minister [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9936.7s)]
*  Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. So is the commission [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9942.460000000001s)]
*  in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9950.3s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9955.58s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda [[02:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9961.019999999999s)]
*  and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. And therefore, we defend that we should refrain [[02:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9969.74s)]
*  from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9979.66s)]
*  celebrations in Moscow. And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 [[02:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9989.980000000001s)]
*  in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=9997.42s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[02:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10009.1s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10017.02s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, [[02:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10025.1s)]
*  I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10033.98s)]
*  to meet the president of the United States, because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10040.859999999999s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10050.619999999999s)]
*  also internal affairs. After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10058.78s)]
*  personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10067.18s)]
*  is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. We start with Tunisia. [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10076.060000000001s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation [[02:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10085.9s)]
*  in Tunisia closely. The EU takes note of the happy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[02:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10093.42s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[02:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10098.78s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10104.54s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. The rule of law, [[02:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10110.859999999999s)]
*  human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10117.099999999999s)]
*  and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[02:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10122.46s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10130.3s)]
*  President von der Leyen's participation in and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the [[02:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10136.22s)]
*  funeral. We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[02:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10142.38s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it change. [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10150.06s)]
*  Chi aufbrеся. [[02:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10157.66s)]
*  Das ist so much, [[02:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10182.060000000001s)]
*  of the legal service according to which the safe proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis, [[02:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10186.78s)]
*  Article 122 at least for part of the proposal. I would like to know how the Commission will [[02:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10197.78s)]
*  proceed and if you would like to modify the proposal, perhaps by dividing it in two parts, [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10209.02s)]
*  how to suggest the Parliament's hopes or if you would like to proceed without an amendment. [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10219.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10229.02s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, Thomas. [[02:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10231.02s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. We are of course aware of what has been reported in the loan. [[02:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10233.02s)]
*  I will not comment on this. Let me just remind you in a more global way that today we have a risk for our security that is real [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10238.02s)]
*  and that is the reason why the Commission has actually proposed this new instrument for safe defense [[02:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10248.02s)]
*  which will allow Member States to make joint defense purchases. [[02:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10254.02s)]
*  This instrument is actually established on Article 122. Let me remind you that in the political and direct lines of the President, [[02:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10258.02s)]
*  the President has reminded us that Article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances like the one we are currently living in. [[02:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10270.02s)]
*  This instrument has already been activated, also for exceptional circumstances. [[02:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10279.02s)]
*  Let me remind you of the pandemic, COVID-19, or the gas prices period when this instrument was activated. [[02:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10285.02s)]
*  The Commission remains of course on its proposed proposal. [[02:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10295.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[02:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10301.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[02:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10317.02s)]
*  The Commission has voted on the EDIP program, which provides eligibility conditions with a European preference, so 70% of European components. [[02:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10331.02s)]
*  What is the Commission's reaction to this adoption? [[02:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10341.02s)]
*  And now the question that arises is the inclusion of the potential of the United Kingdom in this program. [[02:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10346.02s)]
*  Has the Commission sent proposals to Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[02:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10352.02s)]
*  And does the President intend to speak to Mr. Starmer today? [[02:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10357.02s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I will leave the second part to Paula. [[02:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10362.02s)]
*  I have no specific comment to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or in the Council on a proposal. [[02:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10370.02s)]
*  I can remind you, indeed, I just spoke in the previous answer and from SAFE, that the proposal we have made, [[02:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10376.02s)]
*  there is a European purchase clause that is set at 65%. [[02:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10381.02s)]
*  I also want to remind you that the United Kingdom can already participate at a 35% rate in this program when it is implemented. [[02:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10385.02s)]
*  In general, we work closely with Member States that share our views and are very close to us, including the United Kingdom. [[02:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10395.02s)]
*  So we work closely with the United Kingdom. [[02:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10403.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. [[02:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10408.02s)]
*  So for a participation of the United Kingdom at SAFE, as you say, first of all, a dedicated partnership. [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10411.02s)]
*  And so it is also in this sense that we are working and I expect that it will indeed be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[02:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10423.02s)]
*  Yes. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10443.02s)]
*  Antony Fomagali for Noyetsyshetsaitek. [[02:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10449.02s)]
*  I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, but you didn't really answer the question. [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10452.02s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. [[02:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10459.02s)]
*  We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump, but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10462.02s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you send now to the White House or isn't there? [[02:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10471.02s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. [[02:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10476.02s)]
*  And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10484.02s)]
*  Jan. [[02:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10491.02s)]
*  Actually, a similar question, but the other way around. [[02:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10495.02s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of Commissioner of the Kremlin, Executive Vice President, to the U.S., following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10501.02s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10512.02s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[02:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10517.02s)]
*  So no plans that I can confirm today. [[02:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10521.02s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Virkunden is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, be it by a letters that you were yourself referring to or be it with a company. [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10526.02s)]
*  So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10536.02s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[02:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10543.02s)]
*  There's one there. [[02:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10547.02s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10551.02s)]
*  Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data user without consent. [[02:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10553.02s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? [[02:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10563.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10566.02s)]
*  What do we know about this? [[02:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10569.02s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, we are. [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10571.02s)]
*  We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[02:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10572.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious. [[02:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10577.02s)]
*  I will recall it that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us and we're front runners in that field. [[02:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10580.02s)]
*  So, yes, we're monitoring developments very, very closely. [[02:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10589.02s)]
*  OK. [[02:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10593.02s)]
*  Any other questions? [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10594.02s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either. [[02:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10597.02s)]
*  So I wish you a very good afternoon and thank you for your participation. [[02:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10600.02s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[02:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10630.02s)]
*  Short announcement before going into your questions. [[02:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10646.02s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10651.02s)]
*  organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10665.02s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, [[02:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10671.02s)]
*  bilateral relations and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of May. [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10678.02s)]
*  At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance reliable, affordable and sustainable energy, [[02:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10691.02s)]
*  as well as the importance of international partnerships in achieving these goals. [[02:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10702.02s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS, starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. [[02:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10708.02s)]
*  That's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[02:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10721.02s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[02:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10726.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10731.02s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. [[02:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10735.02s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. Christian Eno with NC Europe. [[02:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10736.02s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP 30, where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10738.02s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC by September this year? [[02:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10748.02s)]
*  And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10758.02s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[02:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10761.02s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight timeline, [[02:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10767.02s)]
*  can you clarify whether you're counting on a political agreement on the 2040 target before September, [[02:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10778.02s)]
*  or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[02:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10784.02s)]
*  I can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[02:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10790.02s)]
*  Anna Kaiser, thank you. [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10800.02s)]
*  Okay, so yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, [[03:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10806.02s)]
*  which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10815.02s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include the 2040 emission reduction target in that. [[03:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10821.02s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, [[03:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10831.02s)]
*  which will cover both the 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, [[03:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10837.02s)]
*  and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. [[03:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10844.02s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10853.02s)]
*  And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, [[03:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10864.02s)]
*  and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly, [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10871.02s)]
*  and that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[03:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10877.02s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[03:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10885.02s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[03:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10890.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian, a follow-up? [[03:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10898.02s)]
*  Thanks, thanks Paula. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10901.02s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10908.02s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10914.02s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[03:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10924.02s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[03:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10929.02s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, [[03:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10938.02s)]
*  but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[03:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10944.02s)]
*  Any other questions to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10954.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10966.02s)]
*  Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10968.02s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10977.02s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10985.02s)]
*  Because this would have far-reaching implications considering the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. [[03:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10989.02s)]
*  So are consultancies, standardization, organization, both of them, for instance, affected as well? [[03:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=10997.02s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11002.02s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[03:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11011.02s)]
*  My question is, how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[03:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11015.02s)]
*  One more question, practical. Evie Reconan was supposed to meet with Ektar today, which Huawei is a member of. [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11022.02s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was canceled, sorry, so I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11028.02s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11034.02s)]
*  Thanks for your questions. And the last one, I don't know, I'll have to check that with... [[03:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11037.02s)]
*  It was canceled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, we can come back to you on that. [[03:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11042.02s)]
*  For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no longer access Commission officials. [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11049.02s)]
*  They can't enter the building. It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members, [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11057.02s)]
*  and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[03:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11067.02s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand whether a particular issue being on the agenda [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11071.02s)]
*  with a particular umbrella organization relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. And that's what we're doing it. [[03:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11081.02s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis, and if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11089.02s)]
*  It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, [[03:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11098.02s)]
*  but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11105.02s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[03:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11112.02s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail, and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[03:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11117.02s)]
*  That is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Jorge. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11122.02s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11130.02s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[03:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11135.02s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this decision back then. [[03:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11145.02s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11149.02s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table again, [[03:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11155.02s)]
*  or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back in any form? Thank you. [[03:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11161.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted, but Olaf, you can tell us more. [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11169.02s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[03:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11179.02s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. A follow-up. [[03:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11187.02s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time, [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11189.02s)]
*  before many things happened in Europe and around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11197.02s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11207.02s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olaf? [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11210.02s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11219.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage, Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11228.02s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit on the 19th of May [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11234.02s)]
*  regarding especially the potential defence deal. [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11245.02s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, [[03:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11250.02s)]
*  and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[03:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11262.02s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, [[03:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11269.02s)]
*  and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11282.02s)]
*  Yes. Vitaly. [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11291.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction of Kalas. [[03:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11296.02s)]
*  And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of Poland, he thinks so and gives his opinion. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11305.02s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[03:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11317.02s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. [[03:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11330.02s)]
*  Sorry. Hi. [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11332.02s)]
*  As you said, the HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. [[03:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11334.02s)]
*  What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate activities in Ukraine, [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11345.02s)]
*  We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11353.02s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11359.02s)]
*  Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11368.02s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11373.02s)]
*  but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. [[03:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11380.02s)]
*  Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine. [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11386.02s)]
*  Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11393.02s)]
*  and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[03:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11400.02s)]
*  And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[03:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11404.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and the current conditions. [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11411.02s)]
*  And we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11418.02s)]
*  Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? [[03:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11424.02s)]
*  Yes, please. [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11430.02s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but on foreign affairs. [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11435.02s)]
*  On the situation in Kashmir, we have seen the President's tweet about it, [[03:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11438.02s)]
*  but how concerned is the Commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[03:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11442.02s)]
*  Yes, Guillaume. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11449.02s)]
*  Indeed. As you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the situation. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11451.02s)]
*  What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for a peaceful solution [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11459.02s)]
*  to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11466.02s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11474.02s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11479.02s)]
*  another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. [[03:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11485.02s)]
*  Do you think at this stage, because I know that the Commission supports the efforts of the United States [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11488.02s)]
*  to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, [[03:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11494.02s)]
*  but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the two sides, [[03:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11496.02s)]
*  or do you see it excessively in favour of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11501.02s)]
*  Not to go into whether the position of the US is balanced or not. [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11510.02s)]
*  What we reiterate is the principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11513.02s)]
*  and that is the agreement of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. [[03:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11520.02s)]
*  And these are the principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11528.02s)]
*  Yes. [[03:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11538.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Silvia Youssef from El País. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11542.02s)]
*  Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message [[03:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11544.02s)]
*  might be delivered directly to the White House? [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11552.02s)]
*  I mean, there are several meetings in the next few days, several points, also Rome, where everybody will be there. [[03:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11555.02s)]
*  Do you think there is a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11563.02s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet, as you know. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11571.02s)]
*  Nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11575.02s)]
*  but we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. [[03:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11581.02s)]
*  Yes. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11589.02s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Arad, AG news agency, Italy. [[03:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11592.02s)]
*  That means that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11595.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11605.02s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. [[03:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11607.02s)]
*  That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11613.02s)]
*  If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11619.02s)]
*  But the main objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11630.02s)]
*  Any other questions? Yes, Anna? [[03:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11641.02s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11648.02s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11654.02s)]
*  Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and religious extremists. [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11663.02s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[03:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11675.02s)]
*  The European Commission and President von der Leyen stand by the defence of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, whatever the religion may be, [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11687.02s)]
*  and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, but wherever this is at stake. [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11710.02s)]
*  Yes? [[03:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11725.02s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? [[03:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11732.02s)]
*  As you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defence of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being discriminated against across the world, [[03:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11749.02s)]
*  and this is something for which the President stands for, the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[03:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11772.02s)]
*  Other questions? [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11787.02s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume, can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11788.02s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11810.02s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume, thank you very much. [[03:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11813.02s)]
*  I have a question on Kosovo. [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11819.02s)]
*  I wanted to know if EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, a failure for the fourth time to constitute the Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11822.02s)]
*  Is this affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in the relations of EU with Kosovo? [[03:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11837.02s)]
*  And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. [[03:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11847.02s)]
*  President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11851.02s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by the higher representative that the candidate countries should not participate in that event. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11859.02s)]
*  So I was wondering whether the higher representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of the entire Commission and what's the opinion of President von der Leyen on this and what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event? [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11868.02s)]
*  For their relations with European Union or is just a statement that will have no consequences? [[03:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11887.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11895.02s)]
*  I'm going to start Guillaume. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11896.02s)]
*  So on Kosovo, I would not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries, what I can say. [[03:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11899.02s)]
*  Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to swiftly forms in institutions. [[03:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11914.02s)]
*  It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11920.02s)]
*  It is also important on other issues such as the Gross Plan. [[03:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11930.02s)]
*  As you know, we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to continue the work on this path as well. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11937.02s)]
*  So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11948.02s)]
*  On your second question, I will quickly give me up. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11953.02s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in and Guillaume, you may then complement if necessary. [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11967.02s)]
*  Indeed, we have been clear with not only the member states but also our partners and including candidate countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11978.02s)]
*  with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. [[03:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=11994.02s)]
*  Anything else there, Guillaume? [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12011.02s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU. [[03:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12014.02s)]
*  And the EU wants to count on Serbia as a reliable partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12023.02s)]
*  And we need Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12034.02s)]
*  The EU has been crystal clear with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[03:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12039.02s)]
*  A follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. [[03:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12057.02s)]
*  So this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the midday press briefing. [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12060.02s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12067.02s)]
*  So if I am getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. So no consequences. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12078.02s)]
*  We are not saying there won't be any consequences. It's too early to prejudge. [[03:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12087.02s)]
*  We're not speculating, as you know. [[03:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12092.02s)]
*  And we're talking about an event taking place on the 9th of May, so it's early to tell at this stage. [[03:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12094.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl? [[03:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12102.02s)]
*  Yeah, same topic. It's not only about candidate countries. [[03:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12107.02s)]
*  Last time I checked, Prime Minister Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12111.02s)]
*  So is the Commission in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12120.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[03:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12126.02s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. [[03:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12132.02s)]
*  And therefore, we defend that we should refrain from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May celebrations in Moscow. [[03:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12145.02s)]
*  And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 in relation to overall two events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12162.02s)]
*  Any other question? And I have one online from David. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12179.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. David Carretta, Radio Radicale. Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[03:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12187.02s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12194.02s)]
*  I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the Commission to meet the president of the United States [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12204.02s)]
*  because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[03:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12215.02s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. In fact, it's foreign policy and also internal affairs. [[03:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12220.02s)]
*  After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leaders, personalities and so on, [[03:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12231.02s)]
*  I'm wondering what is your reaction and would you maintain that Tunisia is a safe country of origin in term of migration? Thank you. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12240.02s)]
*  We start with Tunisia. [[03:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12254.02s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation in Tunisia closely. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12258.02s)]
*  The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts pronounced by the Tunisian court, [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12265.02s)]
*  also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[03:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12269.02s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, [[03:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12275.02s)]
*  and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. [[03:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12281.02s)]
*  The rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution [[03:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12286.02s)]
*  and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[03:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12293.02s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of President von der Leyen's participation [[03:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12299.02s)]
*  and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[03:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12308.02s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12313.02s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it change. [[03:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12320.02s)]
*  Thomas online. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12327.02s)]
*  Yes, good morning. Thomas from the press agency, the Italian press agency. [[03:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12331.02s)]
*  It's only a question of defence because yesterday the European Parliament's European Commission approved the life of the judicial service [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12347.02s)]
*  according to which the CEIF proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis, [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12358.02s)]
*  Article 122 at least for part of the proposal. [[03:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12368.02s)]
*  I would like to know how the Commission wants to proceed. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12375.02s)]
*  If you want to modify the proposal, maybe by dividing it in two parts, [[03:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12380.02s)]
*  how to suggest the Parliament's hopes or if you want to proceed without an amendment. [[03:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12390.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12399.02s)]
*  Thomas. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12401.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12431.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12461.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12488.02s)]
*  The question is about the potential inclusion of the UK in this programme. [[03:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12518.02s)]
*  Did the Commission send proposals to the Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12523.02s)]
*  And does the President want to talk about it with Mr Starmer today? [[03:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12528.02s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I'll leave it to the second part to Paula. [[03:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12533.02s)]
*  I don't have any specific comments to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or in the Council on a proposal. [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12541.02s)]
*  I can remind you, I just spoke about it in the previous answer, and about CEIF, [[03:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12547.02s)]
*  that the proposal we made is a European purchase clause that is set at 65%. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12550.02s)]
*  I also want to remind you that the UK can already participate at a 35% rate in this programme when it is implemented. [[03:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12556.02s)]
*  In general, we work closely with third parties who share our views and who are very close to us, including the UK. [[03:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12566.02s)]
*  So we work closely with the UK. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12574.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. So for a participation of the UK in CEIF, as you say, first of all, a dedicated partnership. [[03:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12577.02s)]
*  And so it is also in this sense that we are working. [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12594.02s)]
*  And I expect that this will indeed be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[03:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12600.02s)]
*  Yes. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12615.02s)]
*  Antony Fomagali for Noyetsi Shotsai. [[03:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12617.02s)]
*  I think I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, but he didn't really answer the question. [[03:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12623.02s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12630.02s)]
*  We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump, but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[03:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12633.02s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you sent now to the White House or isn't there? [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12642.02s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12647.02s)]
*  And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[03:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12655.02s)]
*  Jen. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12662.02s)]
*  John, officially Bloomberg News. [[03:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12666.02s)]
*  Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12668.02s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of Commissioner Vikunen, Executive Vice President, to the US, following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[03:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12672.02s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[03:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12683.02s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12688.02s)]
*  So no plans that I can confirm today. [[03:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12692.02s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Vikunen is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, be it by a letters that you were yourself referring to or be it with a company. [[03:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12697.02s)]
*  So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12707.02s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12711.02s)]
*  There's one there. [[03:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12717.02s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12721.02s)]
*  Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data user without consent. [[03:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12723.02s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12733.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12736.02s)]
*  Thomas, what do we know about this? [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12737.02s)]
*  Thanks. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12740.02s)]
*  Yes, we are. [[03:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12741.02s)]
*  We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[03:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12742.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious. [[03:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12747.02s)]
*  I will recall it that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us and we're front runners in that field. [[03:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12750.02s)]
*  So, yes, we're monitoring developments very, very closely. [[03:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12759.02s)]
*  Okay. [[03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12762.02s)]
*  Any other questions? [[03:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12764.02s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either. [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12766.02s)]
*  So I wish you a very good afternoon and thank you for your participation. [[03:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12769.02s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[03:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12796.02s)]
*  Short announcement before going into your questions. [[03:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12817.02s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12822.02s)]
*  organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12836.02s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, bilateral relations, [[03:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12842.02s)]
*  and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of May. [[03:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12851.02s)]
*  At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, [[03:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12862.02s)]
*  as well as the importance of international partnerships in achieving these goals. [[03:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12873.02s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12879.02s)]
*  That's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[03:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12892.02s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[03:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12897.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[03:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12903.02s)]
*  Thanks, Marla. Christian Hennig with NC Europe. [[03:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12907.02s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP 30, where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[03:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12909.02s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC by September this year? [[03:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12919.02s)]
*  And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[03:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12929.02s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[03:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12932.02s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight timeline, [[03:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12938.02s)]
*  can you clarify whether you're counting on a political agreement on the 2040 target before September, [[03:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12949.02s)]
*  or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12955.02s)]
*  I can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12961.02s)]
*  Anna Kaiser. Thank you. [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12971.02s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, [[03:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12977.02s)]
*  which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[03:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12986.02s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include the 2040 emissions reduction target in that. [[03:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=12992.02s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13002.02s)]
*  which will cover both the 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13008.02s)]
*  and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13015.02s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. [[03:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13024.02s)]
*  And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13035.02s)]
*  and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly, [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13042.02s)]
*  that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[03:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13047.02s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13055.02s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13060.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. A follow-up? [[03:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13067.02s)]
*  Thanks, Carla. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13072.02s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? [[03:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13079.02s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13084.02s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13095.02s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[03:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13100.02s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, [[03:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13109.02s)]
*  but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[03:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13115.02s)]
*  Any other questions to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13125.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poulet, for Politico. [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13136.02s)]
*  Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[03:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13139.02s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf who would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[03:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13148.02s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[03:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13156.02s)]
*  Because this would have far-reaching implications considering the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13160.02s)]
*  So are consultancies, standardization, organization, law firm, for instance, affected as well? [[03:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13168.02s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13174.02s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13182.02s)]
*  My question is, how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[03:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13186.02s)]
*  One more question, practical. Evie Reconan was supposed to meet with Ecta today, which Huawei is a member of, so I'm just wondering, and the meeting was cancelled, sorry, [[03:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13193.02s)]
*  so I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[03:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13201.02s)]
*  Good. And this is for Olaf. Thank you. [[03:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13205.02s)]
*  Thanks for your questions. And the last one, I don't know, I'll have to check that with... [[03:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13208.02s)]
*  It was cancelled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, we can come back to you on that. [[03:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13214.02s)]
*  For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no longer access Commission officials, they can't enter the building. [[03:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13220.02s)]
*  It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members, and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[03:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13230.02s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13242.02s)]
*  relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not, and that's what we're doing it. [[03:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13254.02s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis, and if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. [[03:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13260.02s)]
*  It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. [[03:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13268.02s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13283.02s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail, and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[03:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13288.02s)]
*  That is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Jorge. [[03:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13292.02s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[03:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13301.02s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[03:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13306.02s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this decision back then. [[03:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13315.02s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[03:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13320.02s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table again, or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back in any form? [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13326.02s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted, but Olaf, you can tell us more. [[03:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13338.02s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[03:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13349.02s)]
*  Yes, Jorge, a follow-up. [[03:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13357.02s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time before many things happened in Europe and around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[03:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13360.02s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13379.02s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olaf? [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13382.02s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13389.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage, Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[03:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13399.02s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13421.02s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13440.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction of Kalas. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of Poland, he thinks so and gives such kind of commentary. Thank you. [[03:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13470.02s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[03:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13495.02s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. [[03:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13508.02s)]
*  Hi. As you said, the HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[03:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13516.02s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13540.02s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[03:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13553.02s)]
*  So, the position of holding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13581.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[03:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13588.02s)]
*  Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13596.02s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but on foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, we have seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the Commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[03:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13603.02s)]
*  Yes, Guillaume. Indeed. As you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13617.02s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[03:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13641.02s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13647.02s)]
*  Do you think at this stage, because I know that the Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13658.02s)]
*  I will not go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. [[03:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13678.02s)]
*  And these are the principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. Yes. [[03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13699.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Silvia. Youssef from El País. Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the White House? [[03:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13713.02s)]
*  I mean, there are several meetings in the next days, several points, also Rome, where everybody will be there. Do you think there is a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13726.02s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet. As you know, nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, but we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[03:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13741.02s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Arad, AG News Agency, Italy. That means that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13761.02s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of that, of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. [[03:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13776.02s)]
*  But the main objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. Any other questions? Yes, Anna? [[03:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13801.02s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[03:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13814.02s)]
*  Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and religious extremists. So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[03:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13834.02s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defense of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, whatever the religion may be, and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, [[03:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13864.02s)]
*  not just in Nigeria, but wherever this is at stake. Yes. [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13892.02s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13903.02s)]
*  As you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defense of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being discriminated against across the world, and this is something for which the President stands for. [[03:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13920.02s)]
*  Free expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13950.02s)]
*  Other questions? [[03:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13958.02s)]
*  On a different, I see online, so not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[03:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13965.02s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[03:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13980.02s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. I have a question on Kosovo. I wanted to know if EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, a failure for the fourth time to constitute the parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. [[03:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=13987.02s)]
*  Is this affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations of EU with Kosovo? [[03:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14009.02s)]
*  And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[03:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14020.02s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by higher representative that candidate countries should not participate in that event. [[03:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14030.02s)]
*  So I was wondering whether higher representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of entire commission and what's opinion of President von der Leyen on this and what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event for their relations with EU with Kosovo? [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14040.02s)]
*  Or is it just a statement that will have no consequences? Thank you. [[03:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14060.02s)]
*  I'm going to start Guillaume. [[03:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14067.02s)]
*  Yeah. So on Kosovo, I would, you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries, what I can say. [[03:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14070.02s)]
*  Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to swiftly forms in institutions. [[03:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14085.02s)]
*  It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. [[03:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14091.02s)]
*  It is also important on other issues such as the gross plan. [[03:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14101.02s)]
*  As you know, we need we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to continue to work on this path as well. [[03:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14108.02s)]
*  So this is what I can say at the station on Kosovo. [[03:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14120.02s)]
*  On your second question. [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14125.02s)]
*  I only quickly give me up. [[03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14129.02s)]
*  Yes, well, I can already come in and Guillaume, you may then compliment if necessary. [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14141.02s)]
*  Indeed, we have been clear with not only the member states, but also our partners and including candidate countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual with President Putin's regime. [[03:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14149.02s)]
*  And in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. [[03:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14169.02s)]
*  Anything else there, Guillaume? [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14181.02s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week, precisely on this issue that Serbia has applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU. [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14184.02s)]
*  And we do you want to count wants to come on Serbia as a reliable partner for common principles, values and security and prosperity. [[03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14193.02s)]
*  And we need Serbia to reassure of a strategic direction. [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14204.02s)]
*  So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[03:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14209.02s)]
*  Follow up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. [[03:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14221.02s)]
*  So this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the media press briefing. [[03:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14230.02s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any consequences that concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visits to Moscow. [[03:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14237.02s)]
*  So if I am getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. [[03:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14248.02s)]
*  So no consequences. [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14255.02s)]
*  We are not saying that there won't be any consequences. [[03:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14258.02s)]
*  It's too early to prejudge. [[03:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14261.02s)]
*  We not speculate, as you know, and we're talking about even taking place on the 9th of May. [[03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14263.02s)]
*  So it's early to tell this stage. [[03:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14269.02s)]
*  Yes, Carol. [[03:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14274.02s)]
*  Yeah, same topic. [[03:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14278.02s)]
*  It's not only about candidate countries. [[03:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14280.02s)]
*  Last time I checked Prime Minister Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. [[03:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14282.02s)]
*  So is the commission in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[03:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14291.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[03:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14297.02s)]
*  It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[03:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14298.02s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. [[03:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14302.02s)]
*  And therefore, we defend that we should refrain from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May celebrations in Moscow. [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14315.02s)]
*  And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 in relation to overall to events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[03:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14333.02s)]
*  Any other question? [[03:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14350.02s)]
*  And I have one online from David. [[03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14353.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[03:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14358.02s)]
*  Thank you, David Carretta, Radio Radicale. [[03:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14359.02s)]
*  Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[03:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14362.02s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission to meet the president of the United States, [[03:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14366.02s)]
*  because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[03:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14387.02s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. [[03:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14392.02s)]
*  In fact, it's foreign policy and also internal affairs. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14398.02s)]
*  After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leader personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction? [[04:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14403.02s)]
*  And would you maintain that Tunisia is a safe country of origin in term of migration? [[04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14414.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14423.02s)]
*  We start with Tunisia. [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14425.02s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. [[04:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14429.02s)]
*  What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation in Tunisia closely. [[04:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14431.02s)]
*  The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[04:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14436.02s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. [[04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14446.02s)]
*  The rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[04:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14458.02s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of President von der Leyen's participation and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14472.02s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14485.02s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that. [[04:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14492.02s)]
*  But we will keep you posted should it change. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14496.02s)]

*  Thomas. [[04:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14660.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14661.02s)]
*  Question to Thomas. [[04:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14662.02s)]
*  Good. [[04:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14663.02s)]
*  Yes, this morning the industry and security and defence commissions of the European Parliament [[04:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14664.02s)]
*  voted on the EDIP programme which provides eligibility conditions with a European preference, [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14672.02s)]
*  so 70% of European components. [[04:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14680.02s)]
*  What is the Commission's reaction to this adoption? [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14682.02s)]
*  And now the question is the inclusion of the potential of the UK in this programme. [[04:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14687.02s)]
*  Did the Commission send proposals to the Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[04:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14693.02s)]
*  And does the President intend to speak with Mr Stammer today? [[04:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14698.02s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I leave the second part to Paula. [[04:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14702.02s)]
*  I have no specific comment to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or in the Council on a proposal. [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14710.02s)]
*  I can remind you, indeed, I just spoke about it in the previous answer and from SAFE, [[04:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14717.02s)]
*  that the proposal we made, there is a European purchase clause which is set at 65%. [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14721.02s)]
*  I also allow myself to remind you in this context that the UK can already participate at a 35% rate [[04:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14726.02s)]
*  in this programme when it is actually implemented. [[04:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14733.02s)]
*  In general, we work closely with third parties who share our views and who are very close to us, [[04:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14736.02s)]
*  including the UK. So we work closely with the UK. [[04:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14743.02s)]
*  Yes, Karl. So for a participation of the UK in SAFE, as you say, first of all, a dedicated partnership. [[04:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14749.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. And so it is also in this sense that we are working and I expect that it will indeed be discussed [[04:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14765.02s)]
*  between the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[04:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14777.02s)]
*  I think the question was asked before online by David, but you didn't really answer the question. [[04:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14795.02s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump, [[04:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14801.02s)]
*  but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[04:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14808.02s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you send now to the White House or isn't there? [[04:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14813.02s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14818.02s)]
*  And as I said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14825.02s)]
*  Jan. [[04:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14832.02s)]
*  John from Bloomberg News. Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. [[04:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14837.02s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of Commissioner Virkunden, Executive Vice President, to the US following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[04:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14843.02s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[04:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14854.02s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14859.02s)]
*  No plans that I can confirm today. [[04:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14863.02s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Virkunden is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14867.02s)]
*  be it via lectures that you were yourself referring to or be it with companies. [[04:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14873.02s)]
*  So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[04:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14878.02s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[04:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14884.02s)]
*  There's one there. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14888.02s)]
*  Thank you. Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data, user, without consent. [[04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14893.02s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? Thank you. [[04:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14904.02s)]
*  Thomas, what do we know about this? [[04:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14910.02s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, we are. We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[04:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14912.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious, I will recall it, that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us, [[04:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14919.02s)]
*  and we're frontrunners in that field. So yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14928.02s)]
*  Okay. Any other questions? [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14935.02s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either. [[04:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14938.02s)]
*  So I wish you a very good afternoon and thank you for your participation. [[04:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14941.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14949.02s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[04:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14979.02s)]
*  A short announcement before going into your questions. [[04:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14987.02s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today where she will be meeting Prime Minister Starmer [[04:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=14992.02s)]
*  and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, [[04:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15000.02s)]
*  organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[04:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15006.02s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15012.02s)]
*  bilateral relations, and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of May. [[04:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15020.02s)]
*  At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance reliable, [[04:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15032.02s)]
*  affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance of international partnerships in achieving these goals. [[04:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15041.02s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS, [[04:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15049.02s)]
*  starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. [[04:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15055.02s)]
*  That's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15062.02s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[04:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15068.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[04:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15073.02s)]
*  Thanks, Marla. Christian Enyer with NC Europe. [[04:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15076.02s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP 30, [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15079.02s)]
*  where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15084.02s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC by September this year? [[04:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15089.02s)]
*  And a second question, if I may, as well related to that. [[04:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15099.02s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[04:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15102.02s)]
*  But given the tight timeline, and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, [[04:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15108.02s)]
*  given the tight timeline, can you clarify whether you're counting in a political agreement on the 2040 target before September, [[04:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15117.02s)]
*  or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[04:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15126.02s)]
*  I can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[04:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15132.02s)]
*  Anna Kaiser. [[04:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15143.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15145.02s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, [[04:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15147.02s)]
*  which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[04:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15157.02s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, [[04:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15162.02s)]
*  and we will include the 2040 emission reduction target in that. [[04:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15168.02s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, [[04:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15172.02s)]
*  which will cover both the 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, [[04:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15178.02s)]
*  and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. [[04:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15185.02s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, [[04:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15194.02s)]
*  we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. [[04:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15199.02s)]
*  And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, [[04:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15205.02s)]
*  and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly, [[04:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15213.02s)]
*  that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[04:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15218.02s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15226.02s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[04:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15231.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian, a follow-up? [[04:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15238.02s)]
*  Thanks, Carla. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[04:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15242.02s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? [[04:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15249.02s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made any assurances [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15255.02s)]
*  that the NDC will be coming before September? [[04:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15261.02s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[04:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15265.02s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[04:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15271.02s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, [[04:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15280.02s)]
*  but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[04:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15286.02s)]
*  Any other questions to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. [[04:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15296.02s)]
*  Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[04:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15303.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. [[04:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15308.02s)]
*  Just today you shared a statement saying, and I quote, the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[04:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15310.02s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15319.02s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15326.02s)]
*  Because this would have far reaching implications considering the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. [[04:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15330.02s)]
*  So are consultancies, standardization, organization, both of them, for instance, affected as well? [[04:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15339.02s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[04:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15345.02s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15353.02s)]
*  My question is, how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[04:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15357.02s)]
*  One more question, practical. Evie Rekunin was supposed to meet with Ecta today, which Huawei is a member of. [[04:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15364.02s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was canceled, sorry. So I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[04:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15370.02s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. [[04:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15376.02s)]
*  Thanks for your questions. And the last one, I don't know, I'll have to check that with... [[04:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15379.02s)]
*  It was canceled, yes, I'm told. And if you need more information, we can come back to you on that. [[04:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15385.02s)]
*  For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no longer access Commission officials. [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15391.02s)]
*  They can't enter the building. It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members, [[04:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15399.02s)]
*  and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[04:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15409.02s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand whether a particular issue being on the agenda [[04:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15413.02s)]
*  with a particular umbrella organization relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. And that's what we're doing it. [[04:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15422.02s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis, and if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15430.02s)]
*  It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, [[04:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15439.02s)]
*  but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. [[04:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15446.02s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis, and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15453.02s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail, and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[04:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15458.02s)]
*  That's it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Jorge. [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15463.02s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[04:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15472.02s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[04:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15476.02s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this decision back then. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15487.02s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[04:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15491.02s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table again? [[04:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15497.02s)]
*  Or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back in any form? Thank you. [[04:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15502.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted. [[04:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15510.02s)]
*  But, Olaf, you can tell us more. [[04:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15518.02s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15520.02s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. A follow-up. [[04:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15527.02s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time, before many things happened in Europe and around the world, [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15531.02s)]
*  do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[04:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15542.02s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[04:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15549.02s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other questions to Olaf? [[04:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15553.02s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[04:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15561.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[04:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15570.02s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit on the 19th of May, [[04:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15576.02s)]
*  regarding especially the potential defence deal. [[04:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15586.02s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today, also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, [[04:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15592.02s)]
*  and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[04:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15603.02s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, [[04:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15611.02s)]
*  and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[04:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15624.02s)]
*  Yes. Yes, Vitaly. [[04:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15633.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction of Kalas. [[04:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15642.02s)]
*  And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks, because the President of Poland, he thinks so, and gives such kind of commentary. Thank you. [[04:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15651.02s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[04:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15665.02s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. [[04:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15680.02s)]
*  Sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. [[04:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15686.02s)]
*  What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. [[04:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15701.02s)]
*  We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15707.02s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. [[04:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15711.02s)]
*  Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[04:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15720.02s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, [[04:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15724.02s)]
*  but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. Our position is really clear here. [[04:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15732.02s)]
*  Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace, and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine, and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[04:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15738.02s)]
*  And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[04:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15751.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[04:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15758.02s)]
*  Any other question to Joom with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[04:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15766.02s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but foreign affairs. [[04:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15777.02s)]
*  On the situation in Kashmir, we have seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the Commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[04:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15780.02s)]
*  Indeed, as you said, the President has tweeted on and has published a social media post on the situation. [[04:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15791.02s)]
*  What I can add is the EU has consistently underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[04:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15801.02s)]
*  Still to Joom. Yes, Jorge. [[04:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15812.02s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday obviously the furious reaction from President Trump, another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. [[04:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15818.02s)]
*  Do you think at this stage, because I know that the Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, [[04:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15829.02s)]
*  but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the two sides, or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? [[04:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15838.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15849.02s)]
*  I will not go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. [[04:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15851.02s)]
*  What we reiterate is the principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement of Ukraine, [[04:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15855.02s)]
*  that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. [[04:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15865.02s)]
*  And these are the principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. [[04:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15870.02s)]
*  Yes. [[04:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15880.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15884.02s)]
*  Silvia Yusuf from El País. [[04:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15885.02s)]
*  Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the White House? [[04:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15887.02s)]
*  I mean, is there – there are several meetings this in the next days and there are points also Rome where everybody will be there. [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15897.02s)]
*  Do you think it's – there's a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? [[04:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15905.02s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet. [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15912.02s)]
*  As you know, nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage, [[04:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15916.02s)]
*  but we'll keep you posted if that should be the – that should be the case in the coming days. [[04:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15923.02s)]
*  Yes. [[04:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15931.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15934.02s)]
*  Ibrahim Marad, AG News Agency, Italy. [[04:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15935.02s)]
*  That means that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? [[04:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15937.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15946.02s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. [[04:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15948.02s)]
*  That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. [[04:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15954.02s)]
*  If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of that – of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. [[04:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15961.02s)]
*  But the main objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15971.02s)]
*  Any other questions? [[04:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15982.02s)]
*  Yes, Anna. [[04:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15984.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15989.02s)]
*  I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[04:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15990.02s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[04:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=15995.02s)]
*  Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kind of group of political extremists and religious extremists. [[04:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16005.02s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering the most, and also worldwide? [[04:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16016.02s)]
*  Yes. [[04:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16028.02s)]
*  The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stand by the defence of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, whatever the religion may be, [[04:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16035.02s)]
*  and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, but wherever this is at stake. [[04:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16052.02s)]
*  Yes. [[04:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16067.02s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the most persecuted, so if she would pay special attention to them? [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16069.02s)]
*  As you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defence of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being discriminated against across the world, [[04:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16090.02s)]
*  and this is something for which the President stands for, the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[04:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16113.02s)]
*  Other questions? [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16128.02s)]
*  On a different, I see online, not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[04:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16135.02s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[04:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16151.02s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. Thank you very much. [[04:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16158.02s)]
*  I have a question on Kosovo. [[04:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16162.02s)]
*  I wanted to know if the EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, a failure for the fourth time to constitute the Parliament, which as a consequence has a non-creation of the new government. [[04:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16165.02s)]
*  Is this affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in relations of EU with Kosovo? [[04:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16180.02s)]
*  And I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[04:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16191.02s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by the higher representative that the candidate countries should not participate in that event. [[04:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16202.02s)]
*  So I was wondering whether the higher representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of the entire Commission. [[04:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16211.02s)]
*  And what's the opinion of President von der Leyen on this? [[04:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16218.02s)]
*  And what will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event for their relations with European Union? [[04:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16222.02s)]
*  Or is just a statement that will have no consequences? [[04:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16232.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16237.02s)]
*  I'm going to start Guillaume. [[04:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16239.02s)]
*  Yeah. So on Kosovo, I would, you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries, what I can say. [[04:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16241.02s)]
*  Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to swiftly forms in institutions. [[04:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16256.02s)]
*  It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. [[04:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16262.02s)]
*  It is also important on other issues such as the gross plan. [[04:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16272.02s)]
*  As you know, we need we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to continue to work on this path as well. [[04:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16279.02s)]
*  So this is what I can say at the station on Kosovo. [[04:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16291.02s)]
*  On your second question. [[04:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16296.02s)]
*  I only quickly give me up. [[04:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16300.02s)]
*  I can already come in and Guillaume, you made a compliment if necessary. [[04:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16313.02s)]
*  Indeed, we have been clear with not only the member states, but also our partners and including candidate countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual with President Putin's regime. [[04:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16320.02s)]
*  And in the current circumstances against the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. [[04:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16340.02s)]
*  Anything else there, Guillaume? [[04:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16352.02s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU. [[04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16355.02s)]
*  And the EU wants to count on Serbia as a reliable European partner for common principles, values and security and prosperity. [[04:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16364.02s)]
*  And we need Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. [[04:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16375.02s)]
*  So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[04:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16380.02s)]
*  Follow up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16398.02s)]
*  So this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the media press briefing. [[04:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16401.02s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. [[04:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16408.02s)]
*  So if I am getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. [[04:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16419.02s)]
*  So no consequences. [[04:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16426.02s)]
*  We are not saying there won't be any consequences. [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16429.02s)]
*  It's too early to prejudge. [[04:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16431.02s)]
*  We're not speculating as you know. [[04:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16433.02s)]
*  And we're talking about an event taking place on the 9th of May. [[04:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16435.02s)]
*  So it's early to tell this stage. [[04:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16440.02s)]
*  Yes, Carol. [[04:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16444.02s)]
*  Same topic. [[04:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16446.02s)]
*  It's not only about candidate countries. [[04:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16450.02s)]
*  Last time I checked, Prime Minister Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. [[04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16452.02s)]
*  So is the Commission in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[04:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16461.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[04:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16467.02s)]
*  It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[04:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16468.02s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16473.02s)]
*  And therefore, we defend that we should refrain from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May celebrations in Moscow. [[04:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16486.02s)]
*  And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 in relation to overall two events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[04:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16503.02s)]
*  Any other question? [[04:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16517.02s)]
*  And I have one online from David. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16522.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[04:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16527.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[04:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16529.02s)]
*  David Carretta, Radio Radicale. [[04:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16530.02s)]
*  Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[04:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16533.02s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission to meet the president of the United States, [[04:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16537.02s)]
*  because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[04:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16557.02s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. [[04:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16562.02s)]
*  In fact, it's foreign policy and also internal affairs. [[04:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16569.02s)]
*  After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leader personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction? [[04:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16573.02s)]
*  And would you maintain that Tunisia is a safe country of origin in term of migration? [[04:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16584.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16594.02s)]
*  We start with Tunisia. [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16596.02s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. [[04:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16599.02s)]
*  What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation in Tunisia closely. [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16601.02s)]
*  The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[04:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16607.02s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. [[04:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16616.02s)]
*  The rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[04:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16628.02s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of President von der Leyen's participation and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[04:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16641.02s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[04:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16655.02s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that. [[04:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16662.02s)]
*  But we will keep you posted should it change. [[04:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16666.02s)]
*  Thomas, online. [[04:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16671.02s)]
*  Yes, hello. Thomas Galloway from the Italian press agency. [[04:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16683.02s)]
*  It's only a question of defence because yesterday the European Parliament's jury committee approved the life of the judicial service according to which the safe proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis. [[04:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16689.02s)]
*  Article 122, at least for part of the proposal. [[04:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16711.02s)]
*  I would like to know how the commission wants to proceed. [[04:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16717.02s)]
*  If you want to modify the proposal, maybe by dividing it in two parts, how to suggest the experts of the Parliament, or if you want to proceed without an amendment. [[04:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16722.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[04:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16741.02s)]
*  Yes, yes. Thomas. [[04:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16744.02s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. We are of course aware of what has been reported in the press. [[04:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16745.02s)]
*  I will not make any comments on this. [[04:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16751.02s)]
*  Just to remind you, in a more global way, that today we have a risk for our security that is real. [[04:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16753.02s)]
*  And that is the reason why the commission has actually proposed this new instrument for safe defence, which will allow Member States to make joint purchases in defence. [[04:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16761.02s)]
*  This instrument is actually established on Article 122. [[04:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16771.02s)]
*  Allow me to remind you that in the presidential guidelines and political guidelines, the president has reminded that Article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances, like the one we are currently living in. [[04:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16777.02s)]
*  In the previous mandate, this Article 122 has actually already been activated, also for exceptional circumstances. [[04:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16792.02s)]
*  Allow me to remind you of the pandemic, COVID, or the period of gas prices where this instrument was activated. [[04:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16800.02s)]
*  The commission remains of course on its proposal, which has been established. [[04:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16808.02s)]
*  Today, it is up to the Member States to agree on this. [[04:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16814.02s)]
*  And I think that the commission has always been, by the way, also willing to explain its choices to Parliament. [[04:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16817.02s)]
*  I just did it here, but we are of course ready to do it with other institutions. [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16823.02s)]
*  Thank you, Thomas. [[04:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16829.02s)]
*  Yes, Karl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16832.02s)]
*  Yes, this morning, the Commission of Industry and Security and Defence of the European Parliament voted on the EDIP programme, which provides eligibility conditions with a European preference, so 70% of European components. [[04:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16837.02s)]
*  What is the commission's reaction to this adoption? [[04:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16853.02s)]
*  And now the question that arises is the inclusion of the potential of the United Kingdom in this programme. [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16858.02s)]
*  Did the commission send proposals to the Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16863.02s)]
*  And does the President intend to speak to Mr Stahmer today? [[04:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16869.02s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I will leave it to Paola. [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16874.02s)]
*  I have no specific comment to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or in the Council on a proposal. [[04:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16881.02s)]
*  I can remind you, indeed, I just spoke about it in the previous answer and from SAFE, that the proposal that we have made, there is a European purchase clause that is fixed at 65%. [[04:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16888.02s)]
*  I also allow myself to remind you in this context that the United Kingdom can already participate at the 35% level in this programme when it is actually implemented. [[04:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16897.02s)]
*  In general, we are working closely with third parties that share our views and are very close to us, including the United Kingdom. [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16907.02s)]
*  So we are working closely with the United Kingdom. [[04:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16916.02s)]
*  Yes, Karl. So for a participation of the United Kingdom at SAFE, as you say, first of all, a... I don't know if we say it, a dedicated partnership. [[04:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16920.02s)]
*  That's it. And so it is also in this sense that we are working and I expect that it will indeed be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16936.02s)]
*  The question was asked before online by David, but you didn't really answer the question. [[04:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16966.02s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump. [[04:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16972.02s)]
*  But is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[04:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16978.02s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you send now to the White House or isn't there? [[04:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16983.02s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. [[04:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16989.02s)]
*  And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=16996.02s)]
*  Jan. [[04:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17003.02s)]
*  Jan. [[04:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17008.02s)]
*  Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17010.02s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of the Commission of the Kuhnen, Executive Vice President, to the US, following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[04:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17013.02s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[04:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17025.02s)]
*  Thomas, are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[04:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17030.02s)]
*  There are plans that I can confirm today. [[04:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17034.02s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Kuhnen is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, be it by a letter that you were yourself referring to, or be it with a company. [[04:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17038.02s)]
*  So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[04:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17049.02s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17055.02s)]
*  There's one there. [[04:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17059.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17063.02s)]
*  Today, South Korea said that DIPSEC is using or transferring public data, user, without consent. [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17065.02s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? [[04:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17075.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17078.02s)]
*  Thomas, what do we know about this? [[04:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17080.02s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, we are. [[04:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17083.02s)]
*  We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[04:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17084.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious, I will recall it, that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us, and we're frontrunners in that field. [[04:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17090.02s)]
*  So, yes, we're monitoring developments very closely. [[04:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17101.02s)]
*  Any other questions? [[04:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17107.02s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either. [[04:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17110.02s)]
*  So I wish you a very good afternoon, and thank you for your participation. [[04:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17112.02s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[04:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17142.02s)]
*  A short announcement before going into your questions. [[04:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17159.02s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today, where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[04:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17163.02s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, bilateral relations, and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of May. [[04:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17183.02s)]
*  At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy, as well as the importance of international partnerships in achieving these goals. [[04:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17203.02s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS, starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. [[04:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17220.02s)]
*  That's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[04:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17233.02s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[04:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17238.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17244.02s)]
*  Thanks, Marla. Christian Eno with NC Europe. [[04:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17248.02s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP 30, where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[04:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17250.02s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC by September this year? [[04:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17260.02s)]
*  And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[04:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17270.02s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[04:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17273.02s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight timeline, can you clarify whether you're counting in a political agreement on the 2040 target before September, [[04:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17279.02s)]
*  or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[04:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17296.02s)]
*  We can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[04:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17302.02s)]
*  Anna Kaiser. Thank you. [[04:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17312.02s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[04:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17318.02s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include the 2040 emission reduction target in that. [[04:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17333.02s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, which will cover both the 2040, because this is our internal system in the EU, we do this for every 10 years, [[04:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17343.02s)]
*  and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. [[04:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17356.02s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. [[04:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17365.02s)]
*  And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly, [[04:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17376.02s)]
*  that it is our aim to make this presentation, this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[04:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17389.02s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[04:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17397.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. A follow-up? [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17410.02s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[04:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17413.02s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? [[04:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17420.02s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[04:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17426.02s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17436.02s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[04:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17441.02s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[04:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17450.02s)]
*  Any other questions to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[04:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17466.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17478.02s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[04:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17483.02s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17489.02s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[04:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17497.02s)]
*  Because they would have this would have far reaching implication considering that the number of large and small organization that that Huawei is a member of. [[04:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17501.02s)]
*  So our consultancies, standardization, organization, both of them, for instance, affected as well. [[04:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17509.02s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this earlier today. [[04:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17516.02s)]
*  I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organization that advance the interests of the company specifically and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[04:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17518.02s)]
*  My question is, how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a group is designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[04:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17528.02s)]
*  One more question, practical. [[04:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17535.02s)]
*  If you were going to was supposed to meet with Hector today, which Huawei is a member of. [[04:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17536.02s)]
*  So I'm just wondering and the meeting was canceled. Sorry. [[04:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17541.02s)]
*  So I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[04:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17543.02s)]
*  And this is for all of. Thank you. [[04:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17547.02s)]
*  Thanks for your questions. And the last one, I don't know. [[04:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17550.02s)]
*  I have to check that with it was canceled. [[04:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17552.02s)]
*  Yes, I'm told. [[04:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17556.02s)]
*  And we if you need more information, we can we can come back to you on that for everything else. [[04:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17557.02s)]
*  Look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no longer access commission officials. [[04:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17562.02s)]
*  They can't enter the building. [[04:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17569.02s)]
*  It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members and many of them do to say no, no, you can enter the commission anymore. [[04:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17571.02s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people in the European Commission who have the ability to understand whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. [[04:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17583.02s)]
*  And that's what we're doing it. So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis. [[04:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17600.02s)]
*  And if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, then we put a stop to it. [[04:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17603.02s)]
*  It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space. [[04:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17610.02s)]
*  But we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. [[04:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17617.02s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds where we see that there is an issue. [[04:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17624.02s)]
*  We look into it in further detail and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[04:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17630.02s)]
*  That's it. Thank you. Any other question to all of? Yes. [[04:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17634.02s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for all of because it relates to trade and investment. [[04:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17639.02s)]
*  Yesterday, we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[04:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17647.02s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the commission criticized this decision back then. [[04:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17657.02s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[04:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17662.02s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table again? [[04:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17667.02s)]
*  Or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back in any form? [[04:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17673.02s)]
*  Thank you. Yes, for all of as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted. [[04:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17679.02s)]
*  But all of you can tell us more. That's precisely right. [[04:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17688.02s)]
*  We don't have the formal confirmation, so we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that. [[04:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17692.02s)]
*  Yes, Jorge, a follow up. Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time before many things happened in Europe and around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? [[04:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17697.02s)]
*  Thank you. Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[04:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17718.02s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. Good. Any other question to Olof? No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[04:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17722.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[04:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17740.02s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[04:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17762.02s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment, but of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17781.02s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, Vitaly. [[04:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17804.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction of Kalas. And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because President of Poland, he thinks so and give such kind of commentary? Thank you. [[04:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17811.02s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita following yesterday's developments on this subject. Yes, Vitaly is there. [[04:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17836.02s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIPP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[04:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17857.02s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. [[04:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17882.02s)]
*  Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[04:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17906.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[04:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17928.02s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but on foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, we have seen the President's tweet about it, but how concerned is the Commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[04:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17944.02s)]
*  Indeed, as you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the situation. What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for a peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[04:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17958.02s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[04:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17983.02s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. Do you think at this stage, because I know that the Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the two states? [[04:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=17988.02s)]
*  Or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[05:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18012.02s)]
*  I will not go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. What we reiterate is the principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, and that is the agreement of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. [[05:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18020.02s)]
*  And these are the principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. Yes. [[05:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18041.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Silvia. You, Sofya. Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the White House? [[05:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18051.02s)]
*  I mean, is there there are several meetings these in the next days and where points also roam where everybody will be there. [[05:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18068.02s)]
*  Do you think it's there's a possibility to to talk directly to to the United States with Donald Trump? [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18076.02s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet. As you know, nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage. [[05:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18084.02s)]
*  But we'll keep you posted if that should be the that should be the case in the coming days. [[05:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18094.02s)]
*  Yes. [[05:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18102.02s)]
*  Thank you, Brian Marad, RG News Agency. That's mean that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome or are there any context for for the meeting? [[05:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18105.02s)]
*  Thank you. The objective in Rome is really the morning of Pope Francis. [[05:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18117.02s)]
*  That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. [[05:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18125.02s)]
*  If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of that of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. [[05:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18131.02s)]
*  But the main objective is obviously the participation of the president at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[05:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18142.02s)]
*  Any other questions? Yes, Anna. [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18153.02s)]
*  Thank you. I've seen that, of course, that madam president is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[05:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18160.02s)]
*  And in this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[05:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18166.02s)]
*  Because in this century, sixty two thousand Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kind of group of political extremists and religious extremists. [[05:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18175.02s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[05:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18187.02s)]
*  Because they are suffering there the most and also worldwide. [[05:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18195.02s)]
*  Yes, the EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defense of human rights across the world and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, whatever the religion may be, [[05:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18205.02s)]
*  and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world and not just in Nigeria, but wherever this is at stake. [[05:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18223.02s)]
*  Yes. [[05:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18238.02s)]
*  But are Christians a matter of special concern of Madam President, because they are the most persecuted religious minority, because now in the world they are the most persecuted. [[05:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18241.02s)]
*  So if she would pay special attention to them. [[05:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18258.02s)]
*  As you know, there are colleagues in the Commission working precisely on the defense of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be, and we have several which in different contexts are being discriminated against across the world. [[05:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18261.02s)]
*  And this is something for which the President stands for, the expression of freedom of religion, whatever that religion may be. [[05:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18284.02s)]
*  Other questions? [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18299.02s)]
*  On a different, I see online, not clear to me whether they will still be for Guillaume. [[05:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18306.02s)]
*  Can you put down your hand in case it's not Guillaume? [[05:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18315.02s)]
*  Then I have Augustin Palokai. [[05:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18322.02s)]
*  Yes, it is for Guillaume. [[05:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18329.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18331.02s)]
*  I have a question on Kosovo. [[05:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18333.02s)]
*  I wanted to know if EU is following developments in Kosovo Parliament, failure for the fourth time to constitute the Parliament, which as a consequence has non-creation of the new government. [[05:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18336.02s)]
*  Is this affecting relations of European Union with Kosovo, be it dialogue or some other issues in the relations of EU with Kosovo? [[05:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18351.02s)]
*  I have a second question not related to that, maybe for both of you. [[05:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18362.02s)]
*  President of Serbia Aleksandar Vucic confirmed that he is going to Moscow on the 9th of May. [[05:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18365.02s)]
*  We heard the warnings or suggestions by higher representative that the candidate countries should not participate in that event. [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18373.02s)]
*  I was wondering whether higher representative Kalas was speaking on behalf of the entire Commission and what's the opinion of President von der Leyen on this? [[05:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18382.02s)]
*  What will be consequences of this participation of the head of state of Serbia in this event for their relations with European Union? [[05:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18392.02s)]
*  Or is it just a statement that will have no consequences? [[05:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18402.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18407.02s)]
*  I'm going to start, Liam. [[05:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18409.02s)]
*  So on Kosovo, I would, you know, will not comment on the internal affairs and domestic affairs in Kosovo like we do for any other partner countries, what I can say. [[05:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18412.02s)]
*  Indeed, it is in Kosovo's interest to swiftly forms in institutions. [[05:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18427.02s)]
*  It is very important in terms of achieving also the EU reforms and moving forward on this path. [[05:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18433.02s)]
*  It is also important on other issues such as the gross plan. [[05:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18443.02s)]
*  As you know, we need Kosovo Parliament to be established in order to continue the work on this path as well. [[05:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18450.02s)]
*  So this is what I can say at this stage on Kosovo. [[05:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18461.02s)]
*  On your second question, I will quickly give me up. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18466.02s)]
*  I can already come in and Kjom, you may then compliment if necessary. [[05:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18473.02s)]
*  Indeed, we have been clear with not only the member states, but also our partners and including candidate countries such as Serbia that relations with Russia cannot be seen as business as usual with President Putin's regime and in the current circumstances against the [[05:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18490.02s)]
*  the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression against Ukraine. [[05:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18516.02s)]
*  Anything else there, Kjom? [[05:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18524.02s)]
*  What I can add is indeed, as I mentioned last week precisely on this issue, that Serbia has applied and is negotiating for its membership to the EU. [[05:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18526.02s)]
*  And the EU wants to count on Serbia as a reliable partner for common principles, values, and security and prosperity. [[05:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18536.02s)]
*  And we need Serbia to reassure of its strategic direction. [[05:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18546.02s)]
*  So the EU has been crystal clear with our partners, including candidate countries such as Serbia, as we just mentioned, relations with Russia cannot be business as usual. [[05:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18551.02s)]
*  Follow-up on that question regarding Serbia and Russia. [[05:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18564.02s)]
*  So this is the second time this topic has been opened here at the midday press briefing. [[05:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18572.02s)]
*  And like the first time, we don't hear any concrete consequences that Serbia could face because of Vucic's visit to Moscow. [[05:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18579.02s)]
*  So if I am getting it right, Serbia will be off the hook because of that. [[05:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18590.02s)]
*  So no consequences. [[05:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18597.02s)]
*  We are not saying there won't be any consequences. [[05:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18600.02s)]
*  It's too early to prejudge. [[05:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18602.02s)]
*  We will not speak later, as you know. [[05:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18604.02s)]
*  And we're talking about an event taking place on the 9th of May. [[05:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18606.02s)]
*  So it's early to tell this stage. [[05:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18611.02s)]
*  Yes, Kjell. [[05:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18616.02s)]
*  Same topic. [[05:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18619.02s)]
*  It's not only about candidate countries. [[05:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18621.02s)]
*  Last time I checked, Prime Minister Fico also has indicated that he wants to attend the event on May 9 in Moscow. [[05:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18623.02s)]
*  So is the Commission in talks with the Slovakian authorities about this? [[05:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18632.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. [[05:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18636.02s)]
*  It's not just about candidate countries, even more so about EU member states. [[05:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18639.02s)]
*  And we see, of course, this celebration on the 9th of May as part of Russia's propaganda and an attempt to justify its invasion of Ukraine. [[05:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18643.02s)]
*  And therefore, we defend that we should refrain from giving legitimacy in any way to this war and in refraining from attending the 9th of May celebrations in Moscow. [[05:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18657.02s)]
*  And that's a position which was agreed also by member states in 2022 in relation to overall two events of this sort taking place in Russia. [[05:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18674.02s)]
*  Any other question? [[05:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18688.02s)]
*  And I have one online from David. [[05:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18693.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[05:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18697.02s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[05:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18700.02s)]
*  David Carretta, Radio Radicale. [[05:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18701.02s)]
*  Two questions, one for you, Paola. [[05:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18704.02s)]
*  Since we were told that there was no request from your side to meet President Trump in Rome Saturday, I'm wondering if now it's different if there is a request by the president of the commission to meet the president of the United States, [[05:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18708.02s)]
*  because for me it's not clear from your answer. [[05:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18728.02s)]
*  Second question is on foreign policy and Tunisia. [[05:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18733.02s)]
*  In fact, it's foreign policy and also internal affairs. [[05:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18739.02s)]
*  After the condemnation by a court of several opposition leader personalities and so on, I'm wondering what is your reaction? [[05:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18744.02s)]
*  And would you maintain that Tunisia is a safe country of origin in term of migration? [[05:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18755.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18765.02s)]
*  We start with Tunisia. [[05:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18767.02s)]
*  Thank you, David, for the question. [[05:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18770.02s)]
*  What I can say on Tunisia is that the EU follows the situation in Tunisia closely. [[05:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18772.02s)]
*  The EU takes note of the heavy verdicts as pronounced by the Tunisian court, also involving EU citizens and reported controversies around the judicial process. [[05:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18778.02s)]
*  The EU regularly recalls the importance of freedom of expression, respect for the right of fair trial, and due process requirements in exchanges with the Tunisian authorities. [[05:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18787.02s)]
*  The rule of law, human rights, and fundamental freedoms are respected under the Tunisian constitution and formed the basis of a partnership as enshrined in the association agreement. [[05:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18799.02s)]
*  And on your first question, David, as mentioned before, the main objective obviously of President von der Leyen's participation and presence in Rome on Saturday is to attend the funeral. [[05:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18813.02s)]
*  We cannot exclude that there may be opportunities for short bilateral meetings. [[05:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18826.02s)]
*  For the moment, there's not more that we can say about that, but we will keep you posted should it change. [[05:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18833.02s)]
*  Thomas Os online. [[05:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18842.02s)]
*  Yes, hello, Thomas from the Italian press agency. [[05:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18854.02s)]
*  It's only a question of defense because yesterday the European Parliament's European Commission approved the life of the judicial service according to which the CEIF proposal would have an inappropriate legal basis. [[05:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18860.02s)]
*  The article 122, at least for a part of the proposal, and I would like to know how the Commission wants to proceed. [[05:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18881.02s)]
*  If you want to modify the proposal, perhaps by dividing it in two parts, how to suggest the hopes of the Parliament, or if you want to proceed without an amendment. [[05:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18893.02s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18912.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18913.02s)]
*  Yes, Thomas. [[05:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18914.02s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. [[05:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18915.02s)]
*  Hello, Thomas. [[05:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18916.02s)]
*  We are of course aware of what has been reported in the press. [[05:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18917.02s)]
*  I will not comment on this. [[05:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18921.02s)]
*  Just to remind you, in a more global way, that today we have a risk for our security that is real, and that is why the Commission has actually proposed this new instrument for defense, CEIF, which will allow Member States to make joint purchases in defense. [[05:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18923.02s)]
*  This instrument is actually established on article 122. [[05:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18941.02s)]
*  Allow me to remind you that in the presidential guidelines and political guidelines, the president reminded us that article 122 will only be used in exceptional circumstances, like the one we are currently living in. [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18947.02s)]
*  This article 122 has actually already been activated, also for exceptional circumstances. [[05:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18962.02s)]
*  Allow me to remind you of the pandemic, COVID, or the gas price period, where this instrument was activated. [[05:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18967.02s)]
*  The Commission remains of course on its proposed proposal, which has been established. [[05:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18974.02s)]
*  Today it is up to the Member States to agree, and I think that the Commission has always been, by the way, in the position of the President of the United States of America. [[05:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18980.02s)]
*  It is up to the Parliament to make its decisions. [[05:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18991.02s)]
*  I just did it here, but we are of course ready to do it with other institutions. [[05:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=18994.02s)]
*  Thank you, Thomas. [[05:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19000.02s)]
*  Yes, Carl. Question to Thomas. Good. [[05:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19003.02s)]
*  Yes, this morning the European Commission on Industry and Defense Security voted on the EDIP program, which provides eligibility conditions with a European preference, so 70% of European components. [[05:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19008.02s)]
*  What is the Commission's reaction to this adoption? [[05:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19024.02s)]
*  And now the question that arises is the inclusion of the potential of the United Kingdom in this program. [[05:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19029.02s)]
*  Did the Commission send proposals to the Member States and Parliament on this subject? [[05:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19034.02s)]
*  And does the President want to talk about it with Mr. Starmer today? [[05:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19039.02s)]
*  On the first part of the answer, I leave it to Paula. [[05:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19045.02s)]
*  I have no specific comment to make on what is currently happening in Parliament or on the Council on a proposal. [[05:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19052.02s)]
*  I can remind you, indeed, I just spoke about it in the previous answer, and I am sure that the proposal that we made, there is a European purchase clause that is fixed at 65%. [[05:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19059.02s)]
*  I also remind you in this context that the United Kingdom can already participate at a 35% rate in this program when it is actually implemented. [[05:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19067.02s)]
*  In general, we work closely with third-party states that share our views and that are very close to us, including the United Kingdom. [[05:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19077.02s)]
*  So we work closely with the United Kingdom. [[05:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19087.02s)]
*  Yes, Karl. [[05:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19090.02s)]
*  So for a participation of the United Kingdom in SAFE, as you know, first of all, a, I don't know if we say it, a dedicated partnership. [[05:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19094.02s)]
*  So that's also in the sense that we are working and I expect that it will indeed be discussed between the President and the Prime Minister today during their bilateral meeting. [[05:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19107.02s)]
*  Yes. [[05:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19126.02s)]
*  Antony Fomagali for Noyetsi Shotsai. [[05:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19130.02s)]
*  I think I'm sorry to come back to the question that was asked before online by David, but you didn't really answer the question. [[05:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19135.02s)]
*  It's about the visit in Rome. [[05:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19142.02s)]
*  We understand that you take the opportunity, if there is some, to meet Trump, but is there an official request by the European Union to do so, to meet Trump? [[05:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19145.02s)]
*  Is there any official thing that you sent now to the White House or isn't there? [[05:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19154.02s)]
*  That's really everything I can say about the participation of President von der Leyen on Saturday in Rome. [[05:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19160.02s)]
*  And as said, if we have any further details, we will come back to you and share with you. [[05:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19167.02s)]
*  Jen. [[05:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19174.02s)]
*  John from Bloomberg News. [[05:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19179.02s)]
*  Actually, a very similar question, but the other way around. [[05:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19181.02s)]
*  Is there any imminent visit of Commissioner Vikunen, Executive Vice President, to the U.S., following the footsteps of other commissioners? [[05:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19185.02s)]
*  And if so, who is she going to meet? [[05:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19196.02s)]
*  Are we aware of such plans for the EDP? [[05:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19201.02s)]
*  So no plans that I can confirm today. [[05:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19204.02s)]
*  I can just recall that EDP Vikunen is, of course, engaging with her American counterparts, be it via letters that you were yourself referring to or be it with companies. [[05:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19209.02s)]
*  So the engagement is obviously there, but I cannot confirm a visit today. [[05:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19219.02s)]
*  I don't see any other questions. [[05:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19226.02s)]
*  There's one there. [[05:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19230.02s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[05:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19234.02s)]
*  Today, South Korea said that Dipsic is using or transferring public data user without consent. [[05:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19236.02s)]
*  Is the EU looking into that? [[05:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19246.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19249.02s)]
*  What do we know about this? [[05:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19252.02s)]
*  Thanks. Yes, we are. [[05:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19254.02s)]
*  We're actively looking also and monitoring developments in the field of AI. [[05:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19255.02s)]
*  Of course, I mean, it's obvious. [[05:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19260.02s)]
*  I will recall it that the protection of the data of our citizens is, of course, very important to us and we're frontrunners in that field. [[05:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19263.02s)]
*  So, yes, we're monitoring developments very, very closely. [[05:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19272.02s)]
*  Okay. [[05:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19276.02s)]
*  Any other questions? [[05:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19277.02s)]
*  No, I don't see online questions either. [[05:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19280.02s)]
*  So I wish you a very good afternoon and thank you for your participation. [[05:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19283.02s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our midday briefing. [[05:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19313.02s)]
*  Short announcement before going into your questions. [[05:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19329.02s)]
*  As you know, President von der Leyen is in London today where she will be meeting Prime Minister Stammer and taking part in the summit on the future of energy security, [[05:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19334.02s)]
*  organized by International Energy Agency and hosted by the United Kingdom. [[05:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19348.02s)]
*  This will be an opportunity to discuss EU-UK cooperation on global challenges, [[05:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19354.02s)]
*  bilateral relations and the preparations for the upcoming EU-UK summit currently planned for the second half of May. [[05:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19362.02s)]
*  At today's summit, President von der Leyen will deliver a speech on Europe's efforts to advance reliable, affordable and sustainable energy, [[05:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19374.02s)]
*  as well as the importance of international partnerships in achieving these goals. [[05:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19385.02s)]
*  I would like to invite you to follow the President's speech live on EBS starting at approximately 10 past 3 London time. [[05:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19391.02s)]
*  That's 10 past 4 here in Brussels. [[05:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19404.02s)]
*  And with this, we may move on to your questions. [[05:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19409.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. [[05:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19414.02s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. [[05:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19418.02s)]
*  Thanks, Paula. Christian Henner with NC Europe. [[05:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19419.02s)]
*  I have a question on yesterday's – von der Leyen's call yesterday on COP30 where the deadline for submitting nationally determined contributions was discussed. [[05:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19421.02s)]
*  Did the President make any commitments or assurances that the EU will present its NDC by September this year? [[05:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19431.02s)]
*  And a second question, if I may as well, related to that. [[05:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19441.02s)]
*  You have repeatedly said that the 2040 target proposal will come before summer. [[05:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19444.02s)]
*  But given the tight timeline and that the NDC will be based on this 2040 target, given the tight timeline, [[05:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19450.02s)]
*  can you clarify whether you're counting on a political agreement on the 2040 target before September or are you basing the NDC on your own proposal for the 2040 target? [[05:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19461.02s)]
*  Yes, and we can ask Anna Kaiser to confirm that we're working towards delivering on time, on our commitments. [[05:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19473.02s)]
*  Anna Kaiser, thank you. [[05:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19484.02s)]
*  Okay. So, yes, what I can confirm is that we continue working intensely towards presenting a climate law, [[05:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19489.02s)]
*  which is the first step on this exercise that you mentioned regarding the NDC. [[05:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19498.02s)]
*  So first is that we make a legislative proposal to amend the EU climate law, and we will include the 2040 emissions reduction target in that. [[05:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19504.02s)]
*  And then once this is agreed, the 2040 target will inform the decision on our next NDC, [[05:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19514.02s)]
*  which will cover both the 20 to 2040 because this is our internal system in the EU for we do this for every 10 years, [[05:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19520.02s)]
*  and a figure for 2035, which is part of the five-year Paris Agreement cycle for NDC updates. [[05:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19527.02s)]
*  And to repeat what we have had this conversation earlier, we will aim to submit our next NDC in good time, well ahead of COP 30. [[05:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19536.02s)]
*  And this is something that Commissioner Hoekstra mentioned when he was visiting Brazil a couple of weeks ago, [[05:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19547.02s)]
*  and then this is a message that we have been passing constantly and repeatedly that it is our aim to make this presentation, [[05:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19554.02s)]
*  this submission of our next NDC in good time ahead of COP. [[05:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19564.02s)]
*  I do not have further details on the timeline as of yet. [[05:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19568.02s)]
*  As Commissioner Hoekstra has said, the first step is the 2040 climate law, which will be presented before summer. [[05:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19573.02s)]
*  Yes, Christian. A follow-up? [[05:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19581.02s)]
*  Thanks. Thanks, Paula. So you said once agreed for the 2040 target that the NDC will come once agreed. [[05:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19584.02s)]
*  Does that mean that you're counting on the co-legislator to agree on the 2040 target before presenting the NDC? [[05:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19591.02s)]
*  And just repeating my question on yesterday's call, can you say anything whether President von der Leyen made any assurances that the NDC will be coming before September? [[05:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19597.02s)]
*  On the timing and on the order of things, let's take one step at a time. [[05:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19607.02s)]
*  The first step is to present the 2040 climate law, and this is what we're working towards, and then we'll take the next steps from there on. [[05:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19613.02s)]
*  And with regard to the call yesterday, I'm not aware to what extent this has been discussed in more depth, [[05:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19622.02s)]
*  but we can confirm that we abide by our international commitments as also just reiterated by Anna Kaiser. [[05:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19628.02s)]
*  Any other question to Anna Kaiser? No? Good. Then we can move on. You had a question here. [[05:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19638.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mathieu Poler for Politico. Yesterday you shared a statement saying, and I quote, [[05:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19649.02s)]
*  the Commission shall not meet with any lobby groups and or trade association that represent Huawei's interest and or speak on its behalf. [[05:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19654.02s)]
*  And that would include any intermediaries acting on Huawei's behalf would engage in meetings and other contacts with the Commission staff to advance the interests of the company. [[05:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19660.02s)]
*  Sorry for the long quote. But can you please clarify why exactly you draw the line? [[05:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19667.02s)]
*  Because this would have far reaching implications considering the number of large and small organizations that Huawei is a member of. [[05:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19671.02s)]
*  So are consultancies, standardization, organization, both of them, for instance, affected as well? [[05:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19680.02s)]
*  I've got a couple more questions about this. Earlier today I was told actually that the Commission wouldn't meet with organizations that advance the interests of the company specifically [[05:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19685.02s)]
*  and would evaluate that on an ad hoc basis for umbrella lobby organization. [[05:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19694.02s)]
*  My question is, how can the Commission determine whether a meeting with a lobby group is designed to advance the interests of Huawei in particular? [[05:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19699.02s)]
*  One more question, practical. Evie Rekunin was supposed to meet with Ektar today, which Huawei is a member of. [[05:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19705.02s)]
*  So I'm just wondering, and the meeting was canceled, sorry. So I'm just wondering whether this is related to the new policy. Thank you very much. [[05:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19711.02s)]
*  And this is for Olaf. Thank you. Thanks for your questions. [[05:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19717.02s)]
*  And the last one, I don't know, I'll have to check that with... It was canceled, yes, I'm told. [[05:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19721.02s)]
*  And if you need more information, we can come back to you on that. [[05:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19728.02s)]
*  For everything else, look, we've made very clear that Huawei representatives can no longer access Commission officials. [[05:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19732.02s)]
*  They can't enter the building. It is not practical or possible to prevent umbrella organizations that could have hundreds of members [[05:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19740.02s)]
*  and many of them do, to say, no, no, you can't enter the Commission anymore. [[05:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19750.02s)]
*  So, you know, there are smart people here in the European Commission who have the ability to understand [[05:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19754.02s)]
*  whether a particular issue being on the agenda with a particular umbrella organization [[05:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19759.02s)]
*  relates to issues that are of interest to Huawei or not. And that's why we're doing it. [[05:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19766.02s)]
*  So we're doing it on an ad hoc basis. And if there's any hint that agenda points of any meetings go in the wrong direction, [[05:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19772.02s)]
*  then we put a stop to it. It's as simple as that. So we're making sure that we have, you know, a kind of a protected space, [[05:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19780.02s)]
*  but we're not going to stop umbrella organizations from doing their important work meeting the European Commission. [[05:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19788.02s)]
*  So we look at each case on an ad hoc basis and where we see that there's no issue, the meeting proceeds. [[05:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19795.02s)]
*  Where we see that there is an issue, we look into it in further detail and as necessary, put a stop to it. [[05:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19800.02s)]
*  That is it. Thank you. Any other question to Olaf? Yes, Jorge. [[05:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19805.02s)]
*  Hello. Yes, I think it's for Olaf because it relates to trade and investment. [[05:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19814.02s)]
*  Yesterday we heard that the European Parliament and China are in final stages to remove the sanctions that Beijing imposed on five MEPs in 2021. [[05:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19818.02s)]
*  Obviously, I remember that the Commission criticized this decision back then. [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19829.02s)]
*  The sanctions led to the collapse of the investment deal between China and the European Union. [[05:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19833.02s)]
*  Do you see any chance that this investment deal could be recovered or put on the table again? [[05:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19839.02s)]
*  Or do you think the text is completely obsolete and cannot really be brought back in any form? Thank you. [[05:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19844.02s)]
*  Yes, indeed. For Olaf, as far as I know, we don't have the formal confirmation that the sanctions have been lifted. [[05:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19852.02s)]
*  But, Olaf, you can tell us more. [[05:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19859.02s)]
*  That's precisely right. We don't have the formal confirmation. [[05:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19861.02s)]
*  So we're not going to speculate about what may or may not happen beyond that at this point. [[05:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19864.02s)]
*  Yes, Jorge. A follow-up. [[05:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19868.02s)]
*  Yes, but beyond the confirmation or not of the sanctions, do you think this text, because it was signed, let's say, in a previous time, [[05:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19871.02s)]
*  before many things happened in Europe and around the world, do you think this text is still up to date, fit for purpose, or do you see it as obsolete? Thank you. [[05:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19880.02s)]
*  Nice try, Jorge, but we're not going to go there. [[05:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19891.02s)]
*  We'll cross that bridge when we're that far. [[05:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19894.02s)]
*  Good. Any other question to Olaf? [[05:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19898.02s)]
*  No. [[05:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19903.02s)]
*  No. Other topics of interest for today? Yes, please. [[05:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19904.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vibor of Lineage Croatian Radio Television. So a question maybe for Tomá. [[05:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19913.02s)]
*  I would like to kind of ask for some clarifications about the details of the upcoming EU-UK summit on the 19th of May regarding especially the potential defense deal. [[05:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19918.02s)]
*  Well, on this one, as I mentioned at the very beginning, the President is meeting Prime Minister Starmer today also in a bilateral setting, in a bilateral meeting, [[05:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19934.02s)]
*  and the objective of that bilateral meeting is, among other, to also prepare the ground for the summit in May. [[05:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19945.02s)]
*  This is very much unique in the past years, so of course all the preparatory work is being done, including at highest level, and that's as much as we can say for the moment. [[05:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19952.02s)]
*  But of course today's meeting will be part of the preparation of the summit later in London in May. [[05:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19968.02s)]
*  Yes. Yeah, Vitaly. [[05:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19975.02s)]
*  Thank you. Vitaly Sizov, UATV. Do you have some reaction on the attack on Kiev? I see a reaction of colors. [[05:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19984.02s)]
*  And should Ukraine make compromises in Russia's peace talks because the President of Poland, he thinks so and gives such kind of commentaries? Thank you. [[05:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=19992.02s)]
*  Yes, and Joom will take up this question today for Anita, following yesterday's developments on this subject. [[05:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20006.02s)]
*  Yes, Vitaly is there. [[05:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20022.02s)]
*  Sorry. Hi. As you said, the HIVP has just published a social media post on the latest developments in Ukraine. [[05:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20028.02s)]
*  What I can add is Russia continues its indiscriminate attacks on Ukraine. We have seen the brutal attack by Russia on Kiev and other cities last night. [[05:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20043.02s)]
*  This has been one of the deadliest with reported nine civilians killed and over 70 injured. [[05:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20053.02s)]
*  Russia is speaking a language of violence and terror, not peace. [[05:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20062.02s)]
*  Regarding your second question on possible concessions, we have already explained yesterday our position on the peace talks, but I'm happy to reiterate what we have said. [[05:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20066.02s)]
*  Our position is really clear here. Ukraine is the one to decide on the actual conditions when it comes to peace and nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine and nothing about the EU without the EU. [[05:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20077.02s)]
*  And upholding Ukraine's independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity is crucial. [[05:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20093.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and we reiterate those principles also under the current circumstances and developments. [[05:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20099.02s)]
*  Any other question to Guillaume with his various hats today? Yes, please. [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20107.02s)]
*  Finlay Duncan from DW. It's not on Ukraine but on foreign affairs. On the situation in Kashmir, we have seen the President's tweet about it. [[05:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20115.02s)]
*  How concerned is the Commission about a potential escalation in the region? [[05:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20125.02s)]
*  Indeed, as you said, the President has tweeted on, has published a social media post on the situation. [[05:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20129.02s)]
*  What I can add is the EU has consistently, consistently underlined the need for peaceful solution to the situation rooted in the dialogue and engagement. [[05:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20142.02s)]
*  Still to Guillaume. Yes, Jorge. [[05:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20154.02s)]
*  Yes, it's on Ukraine. We saw yesterday, obviously, the furious reaction from President Trump, another attack against Volodymyr Zelensky. [[05:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20159.02s)]
*  Do you think at this stage, because I know that the Commission supports the efforts of the United States to reach a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, [[05:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20171.02s)]
*  but do you think that the position of the United States is currently balanced between the two sides, [[05:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20179.02s)]
*  or do you see it excessively in favor of Russia and against Ukraine? Thank you. [[05:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20184.02s)]
*  I will not go into whether the position of the U.S. is balanced or not. [[05:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20192.02s)]
*  What we reiterate is the principles by which we believe that any ceasefire needs to come into place, [[05:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20196.02s)]
*  and that is the agreement of Ukraine, that is the territorial sovereignty of Ukraine and its borders. [[05:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20203.02s)]
*  These are the principles that we continue to reiterate and call for also under the current developments and circumstances. Yes. [[05:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20211.02s)]
*  Thank you very much, Silvia Youssef from El País. [[05:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20222.02s)]
*  Besides reiterating the position, is there any chance or is there any moment you think that this message might be delivered directly to the White House? [[05:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20228.02s)]
*  I mean, there are several meetings in the next days, and there are points also around where everybody will be there. [[05:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20239.02s)]
*  Do you think there's a possibility to talk directly to the United States, to Donald Trump? [[05:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20247.02s)]
*  We're looking into possibilities to meet. As you know, nothing is confirmed for the moment, so we don't have a confirmed meeting at this stage. [[05:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20254.02s)]
*  But we'll keep you posted if that should be the case in the coming days. Yes. [[05:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20264.02s)]
*  Thank you, Ibrahim Marad, RG News Agency, Italy. [[05:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20275.02s)]
*  That means that you are trying to meet President Trump in Rome, or are there any contacts for the meeting? Thank you. [[05:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20279.02s)]
*  The objective in Rome is really the mourning of Pope Francis. [[05:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20289.02s)]
*  That is the main objective of President von der Leyen's attendance in Rome. [[05:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20296.02s)]
*  If other opportunities arise in the context, in the margins of the funeral, then they will be, of course, seized. [[05:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20302.02s)]
*  But the main objective is obviously the participation of the President at the funeral of Pope Francis. [[05:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20313.02s)]
*  Any other questions? Yes, Anna. [[05:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20322.02s)]
*  Thank you. I have seen that, of course, that Madam President is going to Vatican for the funeral. [[05:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20330.02s)]
*  In this regard, I have a question on human rights, because what are the specific actions of the European Union to defend Christians in Nigeria? [[05:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20336.02s)]
*  Because in this century, 62,000 Christians in Nigeria were victims of different kinds of groups of political extremists and religious extremists. [[05:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20346.02s)]
*  So my question is, because Madam President will be there, would she undertake any steps to defend Christians in Nigeria, because they are suffering there the most, and also worldwide? [[05:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20358.02s)]
*  Yes. The EU and the European Commission and President von der Leyen stands by the defence of human rights across the world, [[05:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20376.02s)]
*  and inclusiveness and the right for free expression of religion, whatever the religion may be, [[05:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20386.02s)]
*  and therefore supports the non-discrimination, the acceptance and inclusiveness of freedom of religion across the world, and not just in Nigeria, but wherever. [[05:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxGvrJhUb0w&t=20394.02s)]
