*  And are you trying to do that? [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6179.12s)]
*  I don't think he's doing the job. [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6180.28s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow. [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6182.08s)]
*  And I'm not happy with him. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6186.32s)]
*  Let him go. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6189.72s)]
*  And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6190.8s)]
*  Believe me. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6195.08s)]
*  Will you remove him? [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6195.56s)]
*  Are you trying to remove him? [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6196.4400000000005s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6197.4800000000005s)]
*  Question. [[01:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6198.6s)]
*  Are you trying to remove him, Mr. President? [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6199.52s)]
*  Do you have a question? [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6201.08s)]
*  Mr. President, how do you judge Boasberg [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6201.92s)]
*  in a case against your administration? [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6205.200000000001s)]
*  So the Constitution does not tolerate [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6207.72s)]
*  willful disobedience of judicial order. [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6209.320000000001s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6211.92s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6213.280000000001s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6214.72s)]
*  I'm going to tell you this. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6215.400000000001s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals [[01:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6216.0s)]
*  out of this country who Biden allowed into the country. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6218.56s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6222.200000000001s)]
*  murderers and drug dealers. [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6224.360000000001s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6227.4400000000005s)]
*  I would say maybe that was the number one factor. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6230.76s)]
*  A lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6232.68s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6234.72s)]
*  is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals [[01:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6237.4800000000005s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6240.0s)]
*  so stupidly through open borders. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6241.68s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6244.64s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes, [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6246.28s)]
*  as you know. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6250.599999999999s)]
*  We won everything. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6251.08s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6251.92s)]
*  We won everything. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6254.8s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted. [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6255.679999999999s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6258.24s)]
*  But you have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6259.599999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you think of the proposal from France [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6262.08s)]
*  and UK of a peace mission in Ukraine with soldiers? [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6267.04s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take heart into it? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6271.599999999999s)]
*  I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6275.28s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6277.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm OK with peace missions. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6280.08s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[01:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6281.36s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6282.44s)]
*  have you discussed with the Prime Minister, [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6285.16s)]
*  these are the Italy and the United States, [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6287.679999999999s)]
*  and Europe and the United States. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6289.24s)]
*  And on China? [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6291.0s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[01:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6292.04s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6293.48s)]
*  I think, with all countries. [[01:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6296.08s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6298.04s)]
*  but we are doing very well. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6301.4s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6302.64s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6305.8s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6308.0s)]
*  Would you say something? [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6308.64s)]
*  Please. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6309.56s)]
*  We've been in the process in ways. [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6310.04s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6311.4400000000005s)]
*  First, we had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[01:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6314.92s)]
*  I believe there's been calls with the EU already. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6319.160000000001s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6322.360000000001s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6325.240000000001s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6329.84s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6332.24s)]
*  Ukraine's President Zelensky has said he has evidence [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6334.92s)]
*  that China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6337.76s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those lines? [[01:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6342.44s)]
*  And also, he said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6344.28s)]
*  Is that right? [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6347.4s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6347.76s)]
*  which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6349.08s)]
*  next Thursday. [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6351.679999999999s)]
*  Soon? [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6353.2s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6354.4s)]
*  so we'll see. [[01:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6356.76s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[01:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6357.48s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6361.2s)]
*  I have no idea. [[01:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6362.599999999999s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6363.639999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, there were reports that you waved off [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6365.8s)]
*  an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6368.48s)]
*  Can you comment on that? [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6371.639999999999s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6372.4s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6374.44s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6376.04s)]
*  to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6378.32s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[01:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6381.16s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6382.28s)]
*  has a chance to have a great country [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6385.8s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6388.2s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6391.92s)]
*  That's my first option. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6392.92s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6395.72s)]
*  it would be very bad for Iran. [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6398.48s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6400.96s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6405.24s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6406.48s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6408.44s)]
*  do fantastically well. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6411.72s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6414.36s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6417.32s)]
*  very successful people. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6419.799999999999s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6421.92s)]
*  I really don't. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6426.0s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6426.639999999999s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6429.44s)]
*  It's really simple. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6431.12s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6432.84s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[01:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6435.639999999999s)]
*  We're not always saying, you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6438.12s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6441.799999999999s)]
*  that deal would have expired already. [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6446.08s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6447.6s)]
*  It would have expired. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6449.24s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6451.48s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6454.6s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6455.64s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6457.08s)]
*  When countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6459.28s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6463.04s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6465.6s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6468.48s)]
*  us to do anything. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6471.12s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6471.96s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6473.88s)]
*  Really, one of many terrible deals made by the US. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6475.48s)]
*  But no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6479.839999999999s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[01:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6484.44s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6487.08s)]
*  The other way is not gonna be good for them. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6489.44s)]
*  It's gonna be really bad for them. [[01:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6491.4s)]
*  President Trump said that the first round of the U.S. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6493.24s)]
*  administration is going to take a serious video [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6495.62s)]

*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6500.839999999999s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[01:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6502.639999999999s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6503.96s)]
*  of our country, he loves our country. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6508.04s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6509.44s)]
*  Mr. President, it's not a terrible termination [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6511.64s)]
*  on the account of Trump. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6513.64s)]
*  Or hold you in contempt. [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6514.4800000000005s)]
*  Will you take steps to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6516.32s)]
*  to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[01:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6519.84s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6522.36s)]
*  I'm gonna respond by saying you'll have to speak [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6523.72s)]
*  to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6527.0s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6529.56s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6531.84s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6536.68s)]
*  by millions of people, many millions of people [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6541.56s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6543.92s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6545.400000000001s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, [[01:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6547.78s)]
*  serious criminals. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6551.16s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6552.24s)]
*  because they came into the border illegally. [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6553.4400000000005s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals [[01:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6556.04s)]
*  at the highest level, murderers. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6558.0s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6560.12s)]
*  and they're on the loose. [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6563.04s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6565.24s)]
*  to get them out of our country, [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6567.64s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6569.76s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6573.08s)]
*  away from a president. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6576.16s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6577.38s)]
*  Tom Ohm, Kristi Nohm, we have done an amazing job. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6578.68s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6583.08s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6585.28s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6586.8s)]
*  We have, right now, 99% border. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6589.06s)]
*  It's in 99%. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6591.780000000001s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6593.34s)]
*  nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6594.740000000001s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6598.38s)]
*  all for medical reasons. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6600.26s)]
*  We allowed them, we brought them through, [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6601.54s)]
*  because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6603.02s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6607.34s)]
*  We have a great border. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6609.5s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6610.42s)]
*  but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6612.9400000000005s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6615.42s)]
*  And no, we have to, we need, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6618.18s)]
*  we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6622.42s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible, [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6624.62s)]
*  you know, they released jails, Georgia, [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6627.66s)]
*  from all over the world and released them, [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6631.2s)]
*  not just South America, all over the world, [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6633.780000000001s)]
*  the Congo and Africa. [[01:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6635.66s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6637.7s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6639.46s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6643.02s)]
*  opened their jails, Venezuela. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6645.16s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6647.76s)]
*  released into our country. [[01:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6649.16s)]
*  And we took them because we had an incompetent administration [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6650.32s)]
*  called the Biden administration. [[01:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6654.44s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6657.32s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6660.72s)]
*  But we have activist judges [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6665.38s)]
*  that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6666.84s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6670.5199999999995s)]
*  and people from mental institutions. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6673.76s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6676.280000000001s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, [[01:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6678.400000000001s)]
*  or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[01:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6681.0s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6684.320000000001s)]
*  and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6686.62s)]
*  Mr. President, back on the train. [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6688.68s)]
*  You called that a very good point. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6690.12s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6691.96s)]
*  these deals would be done, [[01:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6694.96s)]
*  but you also said that you're in no rush. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6695.96s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[01:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6697.56s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6699.320000000001s)]
*  How long can they expect that peace to last? [[01:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6700.72s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better, [[01:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6704.4400000000005s)]
*  because if you were truthful, which you're not, [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6708.240000000001s)]
*  you know, I know you very well. [[01:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6710.56s)]
*  You have gasoline that hit. [[01:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6713.200000000001s)]
*  At Dallin 98 yesterday in a couple of states, [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6715.96s)]
*  you have gasoline's way down. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6719.08s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6720.52s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6724.52s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[01:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6727.76s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6730.24s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6733.32s)]
*  and they started screaming at me, [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6735.16s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6736.36s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I was there for seven days, [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6738.0s)]
*  and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6741.04s)]
*  before I got there. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6743.6s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6745.12s)]
*  the fake news like you, you're fake. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6747.04s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6749.24s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. I just — this is my seventh day. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6752.92s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent, [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6756.84s)]
*  and you couldn't get them. They said, [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6759.16s)]
*  you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6760.36s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6762.96s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job, [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6766.88s)]
*  and now eggs are all over the place, [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6768.36s)]
*  and the price went down 92 percent. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6770.4s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6773.4800000000005s)]
*  Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6776.0s)]
*  Did really — done a fantastic job. [[01:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6779.64s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6781.4s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6782.68s)]
*  Because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6786.0s)]
*  that is playing politics — [[01:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6788.08s)]
*  somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6791.12s)]
*  But he's playing politics. Interest rates should be down now. [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6794.2s)]
*  They should be coming down. In Europe, as you know, [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6798.34s)]
*  they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[01:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6801.4s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6804.44s)]
*  and again and again. But our guy wants to play cute. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6806.0s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[01:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6810.0s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6814.2s)]
*  but that's the only thing. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6815.72s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6816.64s)]
*  because they're not very smart people. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6819.400000000001s)]
*  The Press. Do you regret nominating him? [[01:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6821.400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir. Please. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6824.56s)]

*  Jerome Howe? [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6829.4400000000005s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6831.72s)]
*  we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6833.96s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6836.360000000001s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6839.360000000001s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6842.240000000001s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6844.48s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time [[01:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6847.599999999999s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6849.5199999999995s)]
*  that we're taking in are astronomical. [[01:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6852.5599999999995s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6854.5199999999995s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade, [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6857.919999999999s)]
*  and countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6860.62s)]
*  that they can't do that to us anymore [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6864.679999999999s)]
*  because we have a real President. [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6866.24s)]
*  We have a President that understands what it's all about. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6868.2s)]
*  We had Presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[01:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6872.08s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6876.32s)]
*  or they didn't like business, or, you know, [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6878.08s)]
*  it wasn't like a priority. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6879.88s)]
*  And then you had, like, the last administration, [[01:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6881.88s)]
*  the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6883.84s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6886.26s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[01:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6887.32s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6888.84s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[01:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6889.88s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6893.22s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst President. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6896.5599999999995s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[01:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6900.36s)]
*  So, I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6902.44s)]
*  where this all happens. It's happening now. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6906.32s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6908.44s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6910.2s)]
*  we'll make the deal for them, [[01:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6911.799999999999s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6913.759999999999s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6915.08s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6917.4s)]
*  And I think — I think I can say — [[01:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6919.0s)]
*  for Scott and the other people that are working on it, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6924.719999999999s)]
*  that we're listening, [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6927.88s)]
*  and we're going to be very fair to people. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6929.599999999999s)]
*  But, you know, we're the one that really sets the deal, [[01:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6932.44s)]
*  and that's what we'll be doing. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6935.04s)]
*  Okay? [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6936.64s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Please. [[01:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6938.24s)]
*  The Press. A question to our Prime Minister. [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6941.48s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[01:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6944.36s)]
*  You're so lucky. Yes. [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6945.96s)]
*  The Press. In Italian? [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6947.24s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's right. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6948.2s)]
*  I'm not sure they'd want to read it. [[01:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6949.96s)]
*  The Press. President Trump, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6951.64s)]
*  I'd like to know what you thought about the fact [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6952.72s)]
*  that President Trump considered [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6954.400000000001s)]
*  the Zerevsky responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6957.08s)]
*  And then, if you talked about spending in Italy, [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6959.64s)]
*  what are the maximum limits that he said [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6962.72s)]
*  that Italy can reach, that is, to spend in Italy? [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6965.320000000001s)]
*  We talked about the maximum limits [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6967.92s)]
*  that Italy can reach. [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6969.4800000000005s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is — [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=6970.4800000000005s)]
*  The Press. No, I mean, it sounded great. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7012.68s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7038.6s)]
*  The Press. Maybe I could hear what she said. [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7040.12s)]
*  The Press. Go ahead. [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7044.04s)]
*  The Press. What about asking — [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7046.68s)]
*  The Press. Guys, have some respect, please. [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7048.68s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7051.5599999999995s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7054.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7055.92s)]
*  The Press. President — [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7057.92s)]
*  Prime Minister Malone was asked whether — [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7060.04s)]
*  what she thinks about the fact that President Trump [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7061.96s)]
*  holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7064.88s)]
*  And Prime Minister Malone answered, [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7070.44s)]
*  well, actually, we have — [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7072.88s)]
*  and also, if you talked about the military spending, [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7080.92s)]
*  how — and the raising of the military spending. [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7084.5599999999995s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is that, [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7087.2s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7091.72s)]
*  in military spending. [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7094.96s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7095.8s)]
*  And then we will see, because we are absolutely aware [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7100.64s)]
*  of the fact that it is very important to — [[01:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7102.68s)]
*  the defense is very important. [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7106.72s)]
*  The Press. I will do that. [[01:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7108.5599999999995s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another percentage [[01:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7109.44s)]
*  about the defense spending. [[01:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7113.72s)]
*  And I said — yes, NATO. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7117.04s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent, [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7118.8s)]
*  as it was already decided. [[01:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7121.84s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage. [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7124.36s)]
*  But we are aware of the fact that defense is important [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7128.4s)]
*  for the future, and we see also the war [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7132.5599999999995s)]
*  that we are trying to do at the European level. [[01:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7135.2s)]
*  The Press. And I don't hold — [[01:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7137.599999999999s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7140.0s)]
*  But I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7142.719999999999s)]
*  that that war started. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7146.759999999999s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started [[01:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7147.839999999999s)]
*  if I were President. [[01:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7150.5599999999995s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7151.639999999999s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7154.879999999999s)]
*  and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[01:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7157.12s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[01:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7158.92s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7161.84s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7163.28s)]
*  laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7166.0s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[01:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7168.68s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7172.0s)]
*  and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7175.36s)]
*  I think it's a war — I know it's a war. [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7177.48s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[01:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7179.68s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7181.12s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[01:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7182.5599999999995s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7184.5199999999995s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7186.72s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7187.84s)]
*  if I were President. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7190.12s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7191.2s)]
*  because, as you know, Russia is a lot bigger. [[01:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7193.92s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[01:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7198.6s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved [[02:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7201.12s)]
*  and get involved in wars that — [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7204.8s)]
*  you can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[02:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7208.0s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7211.08s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — [[02:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7212.88s)]
*  if I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7216.2s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7218.76s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7220.639999999999s)]
*  he's done the greatest job. Okay? [[02:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7223.48s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[02:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7226.12s)]
*  President, are you sure about the definition of a parasite? [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7229.280000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7236.280000000001s)]
*  President, have you discussed China [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7237.88s)]
*  and the possibility that Europe will have a lot of attacks on China? [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7240.12s)]
*  Mr. President, are you sure about the definition of a parasite, [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7243.72s)]
*  or European? [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7248.88s)]
*  Would you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7249.8s)]
*  He's never said it. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7252.72s)]
*  Would you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7253.64s)]
*  Have you said that Europeans are parasites? [[02:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7255.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7257.8s)]
*  Have you said it? [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7258.6s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. I don't know what — [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7259.280000000001s)]
*  He didn't say it. [[02:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7260.72s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7261.360000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7263.080000000001s)]
*  No, no, wait. Wait. Next. Next. Next. Go. [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7268.320000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7271.68s)]
*  Prime Minister Milley just said [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7272.52s)]
*  we want to make Europe great again, [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7274.56s)]
*  and we want to do it together, together in the United States. [[02:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7277.200000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7279.120000000001s)]
*  Did you — I guess that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister. [[02:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7280.240000000001s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7284.64s)]
*  And are you looking to do it — to counter China, [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7285.84s)]
*  who is really trying to gather influence [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7289.360000000001s)]
*  against the United States with the help of a strong people? [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7293.16s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7296.68s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, [[02:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7298.88s)]
*  and a lot of it is having to do with immigration. [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7300.68s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7303.76s)]
*  and what they've done with immigration at all. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7305.8s)]
*  And I think they're going to get smart [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7308.68s)]
*  because Europe is being very badly hurt [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7311.16s)]
*  by what they've done with immigration. [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7313.8s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister [[02:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7315.52s)]
*  has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7317.8s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7322.080000000001s)]
*  I said, I wish more people would be like you, [[02:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7324.120000000001s)]
*  having to do with that subject. But they're not. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7326.040000000001s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7330.120000000001s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[02:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7331.92s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[02:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7333.76s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7335.56s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it — doing it. [[02:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7339.040000000001s)]
*  You've seen — you've all seen how the policies [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7341.360000000001s)]
*  of the European Union in the last, [[02:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7344.04s)]
*  let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7346.2s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about [[02:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7348.5199999999995s)]
*  how we were redistributing illegal migrants [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7351.8s)]
*  coming to Italy. Now, we are talking mainly about [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7354.48s)]
*  how to stop illegal migration, [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7357.72s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, [[02:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7359.92s)]
*  and to return people. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7363.24s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7365.08s)]
*  about repatriations and things like that. [[02:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7368.36s)]
*  So things are changing, thanks also to the example [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7371.4s)]
*  that Italy brought in lowering the rates [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7375.32s)]
*  of illegal migration. [[02:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7379.12s)]
*  So they — we are working now together. [[02:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7380.599999999999s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7383.96s)]
*  Good. [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7385.5599999999995s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7387.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7389.08s)]
*  I would like to ask — [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7391.08s)]
*  President Romani, if you have discussed the option [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7393.08s)]
*  of starting illegal illegal immigration, [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7396.2s)]
*  and President Trump, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7399.72s)]
*  if you want to see the Google company doing that — [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7401.72s)]
*  The Google what? [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7405.5199999999995s)]
*  The Google company. [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7406.5599999999995s)]
*  What about — [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7407.92s)]
*  The Google business. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7408.5199999999995s)]
*  If you want to see it doing that, separate it. [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7409.5199999999995s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7411.44s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7412.5599999999995s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7416.2s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7419.8s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7424.68s)]
*  but we didn't discuss it. [[02:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7427.6s)]
*  Are you discussing your conversation with the Prime Minister [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7429.32s)]
*  that changed your mind potentially about tariffs [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7435.12s)]
*  and what you plan to do going forward? [[02:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7437.6s)]
*  No. [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7439.24s)]
*  Is there anything the Prime Minister said to you [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7439.72s)]
*  that changed your perspective? [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7441.0s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7441.84s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden — [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7443.92s)]
*  trillions of dollars — trillions — on trade. [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7448.28s)]
*  And now that's — that whole tide has turned. [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7452.0s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[02:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7454.96s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7456.68s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7457.68s)]
*  25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[02:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7460.88s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[02:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7466.72s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7470.04s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7473.12s)]
*  and allowing the borders to be weak. [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7477.52s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars [[02:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7480.8s)]
*  while I sit here and talk to you. [[02:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7483.12s)]
*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7486.44s)]
*  other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[02:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7489.2s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China, [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7492.36s)]
*  where we took in, up until this point, [[02:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7494.04s)]
*  probably $700 billion. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7496.24s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7497.88s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7501.28s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7502.4800000000005s)]
*  The family got paid money. He did. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7504.4800000000005s)]
*  And so, I don't know, maybe that was the reason, [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7506.68s)]
*  or maybe it wasn't. [[02:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7509.96s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7510.96s)]
*  because there was so much money that his budgets — [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7513.16s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7516.0s)]
*  But I took in, in the — up until this point, [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7518.88s)]
*  my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 percent. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7523.96s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[02:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7527.72s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7530.64s)]
*  So, we're doing very well. [[02:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7534.120000000001s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7537.280000000001s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the healthcare companies [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7539.360000000001s)]
*  that had an impact on the stock market. [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7544.6s)]
*  But this isn't about that. This is really — [[02:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7546.4400000000005s)]
*  we're building a base. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7549.040000000001s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7549.96s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7552.4400000000005s)]
*  in the history of our country by far — [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7554.64s)]
*  history of any country, probably, [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7556.76s)]
*  but the history of our country in four years. [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7558.280000000001s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[02:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7561.24s)]
*  The Press. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7563.64s)]
*  The Press. [[02:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7566.24s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7573.84s)]
*  What do you think? Where would it be signed and when? [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7576.04s)]
*  The Press. [[02:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7578.64s)]
*  The Press. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7582.72s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7587.360000000001s)]
*  with the — the President was here. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7590.92s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[02:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7593.320000000001s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the — [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7595.52s)]
*  I think it's an 80-page agreement, [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7599.12s)]
*  and then what would be signed. [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7600.72s)]
*  The Press. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7602.16s)]
*  Can you clarify, on rate cuts, [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7606.320000000001s)]
*  do you intend to see Powell's firing [[02:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7608.08s)]
*  if he doesn't change his stance on rate cuts? [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7610.84s)]
*  Or is that — is that on the table? [[02:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7613.72s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7615.6s)]
*  at a disadvantage to Europe. [[02:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7620.88s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7622.52s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7625.58s)]
*  We don't have, really, inflation now. [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7627.08s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7629.08s)]
*  Oil is great. [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7632.360000000001s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7634.320000000001s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[02:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7636.52s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7638.52s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[02:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7645.0s)]
*  And food is down. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7650.08s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[02:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7652.84s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[02:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7657.28s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7659.28s)]
*  They're not — it's not that they're up. [[02:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7660.28s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7662.32s)]
*  We should — if he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact [[02:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7663.88s)]
*  on that too. [[02:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7667.96s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7668.96s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7670.96s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7672.16s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. [[02:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7674.2s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[02:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7678.16s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7681.12s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7682.56s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down — and they have gone down a lot. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7685.8s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7689.72s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7691.84s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 instead of [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7694.38s)]
*  $4.50. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7699.52s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried — they tried just for the purpose of the [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7701.52s)]
*  election to get it down. [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7705.8s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[02:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7707.76s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7710.400000000001s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[02:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7713.0s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7720.320000000001s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[02:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7723.0s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7724.820000000001s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7726.4s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7732.32s)]
*  down. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7737.839999999999s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7738.839999999999s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7740.44s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[02:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7743.5599999999995s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7746.48s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7748.08s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7751.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah? [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7755.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7756.6s)]
*  Sorry. [[02:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7757.6s)]
*  Please. [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7758.6s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe? [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7759.6s)]
*  And also, do you ever notice when the war, the first step on ends? [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7764.6s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best ally. [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7767.88s)]
*  She's doing — no, she's doing a great job. [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7773.72s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[02:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7775.72s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7781.32s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7785.08s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7787.68s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[02:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7790.76s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k__FYY554BA&t=7795.04s)]
