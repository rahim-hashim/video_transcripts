Video Description: Marjorie Taylor Greene, US Representative, criticised the Biden administration for allowing millions of illegal immigrants to enter the country, citing national security risks, including the influx of Special Interest Aliens (SIA), who may pose a terrorist threat. Greene’s proposed legislation would require the Department of Homeland Security to release data on these potential threats monthly, arguing for greater transparency and security.

# Marjorie Greene criticises Biden admin for national security threats posed by illegal immigration
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME)
*  The Biden administration created one of the most damaging national security threats our country [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=0.0s)]
*  has ever faced. They allowed over 12 million illegals from over 170 countries and territories [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  to break our laws, invade our country, rape our women and children, and murder our own people. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  The American people deserve to know the number of potential terrorists Kamala Harris and Joe Biden [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  allowed to come in the United States. They also deserve to know the numbers under the Trump [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=28.0s)]
*  administration to see a president who cares about the American people secure the border. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=33.52s)]
*  The Biden administration created one of the most damaging national security threats our country has [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=40.56s)]
*  ever faced. They allowed over 12 million illegals from over 170 countries and territories to break [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  our laws, invade our country, rape our women and children, and murder our own people. Now Democrats [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=54.16s)]
*  are fighting against the Trump administration, fighting against deportations of people who broke [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=62.8s)]
*  our laws, who are members of the cartel, and they're protesting every single day for these [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=68.72s)]
*  cartel members to be brought back in America, which is a national security risk. Two million [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=74.0s)]
*  of these illegals that the Biden administration and Democrats welcomed into the country are known [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=80.48s)]
*  gotaways who completely evaded U.S. authorities and are roaming the interior of the United States. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=86.4s)]
*  Included in these 12 million are special interest aliens also known as SIAs. Special interest aliens [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=93.76s)]
*  are individuals who pose a potential national security risk to the United States, typically [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=101.60000000000001s)]
*  from a nation that promotes terrorist activity or harbors terrorists. Under the Biden-Harris [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=107.92s)]
*  administration there were at least 1.7 million special interest aliens from 26 countries [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=114.0s)]
*  encountered at our border. This does not include the potential SIAs among the two million known [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=121.92s)]
*  gotaways. I say at least because the true scope of how many SIAs remains largely unknown since DHS [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  is not required to disclose this critical information publicly. The American people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=136.8s)]
*  deserve to know how many potential terrorists are coming across the border and which countries they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  are from, which is exactly what my bill does and I can't imagine how anybody across the aisle can [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=149.12s)]
*  even argue with this. According to the former chief border patrol agent of the San Diego sector, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=156.16000000000003s)]
*  prior to the Biden-Harris administration, the sector averaged only 10 to 15 SIAs [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=161.92s)]
*  arrests per year. He testified, once word was out that the border was far easier to cross, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  San Diego went to over 100 SIAs in 2022, well over that in 2023 and even more that this year [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=176.23999999999998s)]
*  and that's the ones that they knew of. The number of special interest aliens skyrocketed [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=187.04s)]
*  over the last four years and even more egregiously the Biden administration tried to cover it up. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  The administration of Kamala Harris, Joe Biden and Secretary Mayorkas impeached by the house, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=198.88s)]
*  by the way, told the chief's border patrol agent of the San Diego sector that he was prohibited [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=204.88s)]
*  from releasing any of this information on the increase in SIAs or mention any of the arrest [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=211.76s)]
*  at the time. That's unbelievable. The administration tried to convince the public that there was no [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=221.04s)]
*  threat at the border. They were complicit in covering up the invasion at our border. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=227.12s)]
*  The American people deserve to know the number of potential terrorists Kamala Harris and Joe Biden [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=233.2s)]
*  allowed to come in the United States. They also deserve to know the numbers under the Trump [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=240.96s)]
*  administration to see a president who cares about the American people secure the border. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  That is why I'm urging the support for my legislation which would require DHS to publicly [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=254.24s)]
*  release information each month on the number of SIA encounters as well as countries of origin. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=260.72s)]
*  Thankfully, President Trump has secured our border and restored our nation's sovereignty. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=269.12s)]
*  Given the number of border crossings is down 94 percent, border crossings are down 94 percent, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=274.88s)]
*  down to the lowest monthly levels ever recorded. I have no doubt that under his leadership, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=283.36s)]
*  SIA encounters will cease if they haven't already. I encourage my colleagues to support [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=291.12s)]
*  this bill. With that, I yield back, Mr. Chairman. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_yiBJWPJME&t=297.76s)]
