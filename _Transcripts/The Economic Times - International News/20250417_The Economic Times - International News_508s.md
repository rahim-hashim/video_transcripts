# 'Can't rely on…': ECB cuts interest rates again by 25bps as Europe braces for Trump tariffs
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA)

*  declining in March. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=92.16s)]
*  Thank you so much for your two questions. I can confirm to you that the decision to cut [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  rates by 25 basis points was a unanimous decision. Options were debated, but there was no one to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=130.24s)]
*  argue in favour of a 50 basis point cut, for instance. So 25 basis points was definitely [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=141.52s)]
*  the rate cut on which all in the room agreed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  Looking at today, and I will happily address the issue of why we actually cut rate, because I think [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  it's a two-fold rational, but looking at today and the tariffs debate that is going on, as well as [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=169.6s)]
*  the tariff impact that is actually happening, we know that it's a negative demand shock. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=179.2s)]
*  We can anticipate that it will have some impact on growth, but the net impact on inflation will only [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=189.36s)]
*  become clearer over the course of time. There will be many decisions and many implementations that will [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=201.04s)]
*  take place over the course of the next few weeks and months that will be decisive to err in one [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=207.84s)]
*  direction or the other. But I think the net impact of inflation will become clearer over the course [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=213.84s)]
*  of time. Thank you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=225.04s)]
*  Thank you. Next question goes to Jana Rando of Buhnberg. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=228.4s)]
*  Thank you very much. In your policy statement and also in your remarks now, you no longer [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=234.48s)]
*  characterise the policy stance on the restrictive neutral accommodative spectrum. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=241.36s)]
*  I would be quite interested in why you decided to do that and what kind of conclusions we are [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  to draw from that. Following on, I would like to know whether the direction of travel, as you so [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=254.88000000000002s)]
*  often have said, is still clear on policy ahead. Then I want to pick up, so that's kind of a big [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=262.96000000000004s)]
*  first one, and I do want to pick up on what you told Annette just now about options were debated. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=270.32s)]
*  Would you care to elaborate a little bit more on what kind of options were debated? Thank you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=277.92s)]
*  Well, on your first two-fold questions, right? How we call it that way. So, your first question, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=286.0s)]
*  I think, is very relevant because we did remove from the monetary policy statement [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=293.76s)]
*  a sentence that referred to the restrictiveness and in particular as lately qualified the meaningfully [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=300.48s)]
*  restrictiveness or not. And while that assessment of the restrictiveness was meaningful or made [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=306.24s)]
*  sense to the extent that we were very far away from destination, it is [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=314.56s)]
*  meaningless at this point in time. Meaningless because assessing restrictiveness relies heavily [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=324.24s)]
*  on the comparison between the policy rates and the neutral rate. And I think I had the opportunity [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=331.6s)]
*  in front of this esteemed group to give you my views and I think the views that are shared by [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=338.48s)]
*  many of us on the governing council concerning the neutral rate. Our view, my view certainly, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=343.68s)]
*  is that the neutral rate apart from the measurements issues associated with it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  is a concept that works for a shock-free world. That's how it is described. And anybody in this [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  room who thinks that we are in a shock-free world, would I suggest maybe raise their hands or have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=364.24s)]
*  their head examined. Either way. But we are not in a shock-free world, that's for sure. So [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=372.08s)]
*  that assessment of the restrictiveness is not operative anymore. And what we need to do is to [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=381.2s)]
*  determine the appropriate monetary policy stance that will actually take us to our destination. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=387.44s)]
*  And I will not comment on the direction of travel, I will comment on the destination [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=396.0s)]
*  that as you know is our 2% target in a sustained manner. I think given the cloud of uncertainty [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=402.08s)]
*  that we have, the multiple decisions that are expected or lack of it in the next few weeks and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=409.52s)]
*  months, our stance will have to be determined by two key attributes. The first one is readiness. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=418.0s)]
*  We must be attentive to all the developments and in particular the development of those new shocks [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=426.96s)]
*  and be able to make the appropriate determination. And that's the first one. The second one is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=434.0s)]
*  agility. Given the speed at which we see development, the impact they have, the spillovers [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=443.2s)]
*  that we can analyse, it's not going to be a question of rushing to a particular stance, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=450.8s)]
*  but it will be a question of agility in the face of what we are seeing. And that will require [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=458.8s)]
*  a cohesive approach that will be based more than ever on the analysis of data. So when I say I have [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=466.0s)]
*  said repeatedly we need to be data dependent and we need to decide meeting by meetings and we do [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=472.48s)]
*  not have a predetermined path. I know this has been annoying for some because there's nothing like [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=478.8s)]
*  having a bit more certainty, anticipating where it's going. More than ever now we need to be data [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=484.40000000000003s)]
*  dependent and we need to rely on safe, reliable data. We are going to be particularly attentive [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=492.24s)]
*  to all that at the moment. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JQKldt0dLA&t=498.88s)]
