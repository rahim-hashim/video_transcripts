# Pam Bondi should investigate Shapiro home arson attack as ‘antisemitic hate crime’: Chuck Schumer
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA)
*  Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has urged Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate the arson attack on Pennsylvania Governor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=0.0s)]
*  Josh Shapiro's residence has a possible anti-Semitic hate crime. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=12.0s)]
*  In a letter to Bondi, the Democrat leader said the local district attorney acknowledged that Governor Shapiro's religion appears to have factored into the suspect's decisions. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=16.0s)]
*  This was despite no charges of hate crime registered in the case, Schumer stated. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=25.0s)]
*  Our federal authorities must bring the full weight of our civil rights laws to bear in examining this matter. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=30.0s)]
*  No person or public official should be targeted because of their faith, and no community should wonder whether such acts will be met with silence, Schumer wrote in the letter. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=36.0s)]
*  Schumer said the suspect's Palestinian statements, combined with rising anti-Semitism globally and across the country, raise serious concerns about anti-Semitic motivation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=46.0s)]
*  Schumer, one of the few senators of Jewish faith in public office, has been targeted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a Palestinian. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=57.0s)]
*  Shapiro, a Democrat, is a practicing Jew, which Schumer feels fueled the attack. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=66.0s)]
*  Shapiro had celebrated the Jewish holiday of Passover with his family before the attack. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=71.0s)]
*  It wasn't clear at the time what the motives were of, you know, the arsonist, but that nothing he could do would deter me from doing my job as governor. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=76.0s)]
*  Nothing he could do would deter me from proudly and openly practicing my faith. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=89.0s)]
*  I told you that day that I was going to be heading to our second Seder, and we did. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=99.0s)]
*  We had a beautiful Seder together, and I continue to find strength in my faith as we go forward here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=105.0s)]
*  I know that there are people out there who want to ascribe their own viewpoints as to what happened here and why. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=114.0s)]
*  I know there are people out there who want to adopt their own political viewpoints or their own worldviews as to what happened and why. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=128.0s)]
*  I choose not to participate in that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=138.0s)]
*  I said after the assassination attempt on the president in Butler. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=145.0s)]
*  I said in Altoona after we captured the individual who shot and killed the U.S. health care CEO. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=153.0s)]
*  And I said on Sunday that this kind of violence has no place in our society, regardless of what motivates it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=162.0s)]
*  The fire at the governor's residence was reported at about 2 a.m. on April 13. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=170.0s)]
*  The family was safely evacuated. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=175.0s)]
*  The Shapiro family hosted over two dozen people for the first night of Passover. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=177.0s)]
*  The suspect, Cody Balmer, allegedly hopped a fence at the governor's mansion, broke windows, and hurled Molotov cocktails inside. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=181.0s)]
*  The 38-year-old called 911 an hour later, saying he would not take part in Shapiro's plans for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=189.0s)]
*  The Trump administration has supported Israel in the war in Gaza against Hamas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=198.0s)]
*  The White House has also directed universities to comply with curbing anti-Semitic protests in favor of Palestine on college campuses. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-36Mksw6AA&t=203.0s)]
