Video Description: A new National Institutes of Health (NIH) initiative, spearheaded by US Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to compile comprehensive medical records for autism research has ignited a debate surrounding data privacy and the ethical implications of large-scale health data collection. The initiative, announced by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, aims to provide researchers with unprecedented access to a vast pool of patient data, including pharmacy records, genomic information, and even data from wearable fitness trackers. “Sec. Kennedy has asked me to initiate a study on the cause of the rise in autism. It's a question that is at the front of the minds of so many parents, yet scientific progress on this has been slow because scientists are frankly scared to ask the question,” Jay Bhattacharya said.

# 'Cause of rise in autism, a question scientists scared to ask': Jay Bhattacharya
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y)
*  A new National Institutes of Health initiative, spearheaded by U.S. Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Jr., to compile comprehensive medical records for autism research has ignited a debate surrounding [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=6.4s)]
*  data privacy and the ethical implications of large-scale health data collection. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=12.32s)]
*  The initiative, announced by NIH Director Dr. J. Padacharya, aims to provide researchers with [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=19.2s)]
*  unprecedented access to a vast pool of patient data, including pharmacy records, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=24.88s)]
*  genomic information, and even data from wearable fitness trackers. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=30.16s)]
*  I just wanted to make a couple of comments about the role of the NIH in all this. One of the major [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=33.92s)]
*  problems that I think that parents around the country have faced is when they go to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=40.16s)]
*  scientific literature, they come back with a stonewall. They hear that, well, the science [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=45.68s)]
*  hasn't been done, it's not rigorous. And part of the problem is that scientists are afraid to ask [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=50.96s)]
*  questions, basic questions that parents want answers to. Secretary Kennedy has asked me to, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=55.52s)]
*  for instance, to initiate a study on autism, the cause of the rise in autism. It's a question that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  is at the front of the minds of so many parents across the country worried about their kids. And [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=70.32s)]
*  yet, scientific progress on this has been slow because scientists are frankly scared to ask the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=76.24s)]
*  question. The goal of my leadership, the NIH, is going to make it so that those questions are no [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=82.24s)]
*  longer taboo among scientists. Scientists need to work on the things that actually are at the top of [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=88.56s)]
*  the minds of the American people. The mission of the NIH is to do research that extends the life [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  expectancy and improves the health of the American people. And that's exactly what we're going to do. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=103.84s)]
*  Since 2012, the United States has seen no increase in life expectancy, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=109.76s)]
*  none. And it collapsed during the pandemic and only recently has it started to come back up to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=115.28s)]
*  2019 levels. That is a situation that is a catastrophic failure of the American public [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=119.92s)]
*  health system. And it frankly is also a failure of American scientists to address the key drivers of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  this enormous chronic disease crisis we're facing. And I'm really grateful to Secretary Kennedy for [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=132.48s)]
*  his leadership and I'm grateful to President Trump for his leadership in giving us the opportunity [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=140.32s)]
*  to turn the ingenuity of American scientists to the questions of how to improve American [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=145.92s)]
*  health and to make America healthy again. Thank you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veIiryI0H_Y&t=151.12s)]
