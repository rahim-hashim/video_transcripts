Video Description: US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is in “no rush” to reach any trade deals because of the revenues his tariffs are generating, but he suggested, while meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, that it would be easy to find an agreement with the European Union and others. Trump played down the likelihood of an accelerated timeline to wrap up deals, saying any agreements would come “at a certain point.” “We're in no rush,” said Trump, hinting that he has leverage because other countries want access to U.S. consumers.

# Trump meets Italian PM Meloni, discusses tariffs, says confident of EU deal but in 'no rush'
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA)
*  It's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, who's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=0.0s)]
*  doing a fantastic job. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=15.96s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=17.3s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her, and I can't say that about many people. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=23.02s)]
*  She's become a friend and we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=28.96s)]
*  We talked about trade, we talked about many, many things during our luncheon, and she'll [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=36.76s)]
*  be saying a few words, but she's a very special person and it's nice to have you with us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=44.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=48.16s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=49.16s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=50.16s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=54.720000000000006s)]
*  that comes from very far. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=59.52s)]
*  You know today is April 17th, and April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=61.2s)]
*  allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=72.60000000000001s)]
*  another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=80.22s)]
*  to erase our history. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=87.62s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=89.98s)]
*  against synthetic drugs. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=98.78s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=100.22s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=107.16s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=114.58s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=125.34s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=133.94s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest, as they've been doing for many years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=137.74s)]
*  As you know, in the next years, I think around 10 billion. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=145.84s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=150.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=154.22s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=155.74s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=160.34s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the next weeks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=166.34s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=173.44s)]
*  nationalism. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=178.02s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=179.02s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=180.74s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=186.78s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=189.38s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=191.62s)]
*  time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=198.5s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  visit to Rome in the near future and consider a possibility in that occasion to meet also [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=208.85999999999999s)]
*  with Europe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=215.38s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=217.38s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=220.38s)]
*  We can. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=222.38s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=223.38s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=227.38s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=228.38s)]
*  very good, has a very good situation despite the difficulties, a stable country, a reliable [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=236.38s)]
*  country. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=242.38s)]
*  We have a million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=243.38s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=248.38s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=249.38s)]
*  me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=255.38s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=256.38s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=259.38s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=263.38s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=265.38s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=267.38s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=269.38s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=271.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=272.38s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=273.38s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=274.38s)]
*  we can. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=278.38s)]
*  We want to save. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=279.38s)]
*  On average, think of it every week, 2,500 people are being killed, mostly soldiers, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=280.38s)]
*  Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=285.38s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=287.38s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=291.38s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll let you know very soon. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=292.38s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=296.38s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=297.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=298.38s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed player cooperation and discussed with the Prime Minister [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=299.38s)]
*  in the Italy-U.S. and Europe? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=304.38s)]
*  And China? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=307.38s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=309.38s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=310.38s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=314.38s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=319.38s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=322.38s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=324.38s)]
*  Would you say something? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=325.38s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=326.38s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=328.38s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=331.38s)]
*  I believe it's been called with the EU already. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=335.38s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=338.38s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=341.38s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=345.38s)]
*  You did say that you were confident these deals will be done. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=348.38s)]
*  But you also said that you're in no rush. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=351.38s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=352.38s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=354.38s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=355.38s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=359.38s)]
*  because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=363.38s)]
*  you have gasoline that hit. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=368.38s)]
*  At Dallin 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=371.38s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=375.38s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=379.38s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=382.38s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=385.38s)]
*  I just got there. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=388.38s)]
*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=389.38s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=391.38s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=393.38s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=395.38s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=400.38s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=404.38s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=408.38s)]
*  I've only been here. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=409.38s)]
*  I just, this is my seventh day. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=410.38s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=412.38s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=413.38s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=415.38s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=418.38s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=420.38s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=422.38s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=424.38s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=429.38s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=435.38s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=437.38s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates because we have a Federal Reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=438.38s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=446.38s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=449.38s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=452.38s)]
*  They should be coming down. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=453.38s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=455.38s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=459.38s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=462.38s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=465.38s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=469.38s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=472.38s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=476.38s)]
*  But, you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=485.38s)]
*  That's what we'll be doing. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=488.38s)]
*  The Press I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=489.38s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it is having to do with immigration. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=508.38s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=513.38s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=518.38s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=525.38s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=531.38s)]
*  I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=533.38s)]
*  But they're not. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=537.38s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=539.38s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=541.38s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=543.38s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=545.38s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=548.38s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=550.38s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=558.38s)]
*  At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=559.38s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=565.38s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=574.38s)]
*  So things are changing. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=581.38s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=583.38s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=590.38s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=594.38s)]
*  President Deloni, if you have discussed the option of starting here with Italy on civil rights communications, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=596.38s)]
*  and President Trump, if you want to see the Google company, what about the Google business? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=601.38s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=611.38s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=617.38s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=621.38s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=626.38s)]
*  So is it the Prime Minister that changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you plan to do going forward? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=630.38s)]
*  No. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=636.38s)]
*  That changed your perspective? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=637.38s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=639.38s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden, trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=641.38s)]
*  And now that whole tide has turned. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=648.38s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=651.38s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=653.38s)]
*  Don't forget we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=654.38s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=662.38s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=666.38s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=676.38s)]
*  And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=683.38s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=689.38s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=695.38s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=697.38s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=699.38s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=700.38s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=702.38s)]
*  He did. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=703.38s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=704.38s)]
*  Maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=706.38s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because it was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=708.38s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=716.38s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=725.38s)]
*  I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=727.38s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=730.38s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=733.38s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=735.38s)]
*  But this is about that. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=742.38s)]
*  This is really we're building a base. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=744.38s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=746.38s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=748.38s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=757.38s)]
*  Only if the prime minister remains the prime minister can it be our best. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=766.38s)]
*  She's doing now she's doing a great job. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=772.38s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=774.38s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=779.38s)]
*  And our relationship is is great. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=783.38s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=786.38s)]
*  I tell you, and they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=788.38s)]
*  But I think we're going to have a great time. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=795.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=797.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=799.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=801.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=803.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=805.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=807.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=809.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=811.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=813.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=815.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=817.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=819.38s)]
*  We're going to have a great time. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqfDRz6gSMA&t=821.38s)]
