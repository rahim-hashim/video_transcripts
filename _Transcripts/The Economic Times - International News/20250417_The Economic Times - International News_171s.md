# 'I wouldn’t say I waived off Israeli plan to attack Iran, but I’m not in a rush’: Trump
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo)
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. It's, you know, pretty simple. It's really simple. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=0.0s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. We're not looking to take their land. We're not. All [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=5.04s)]
*  we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. The deal that was made, the deal that was made [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  with Obama, this deal would have expired already. It was a terrible deal. It would have expired. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=16.88s)]
*  Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=23.04s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. That's my first option. If there's a second option, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=35.68s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=43.68s)]
*  Then you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear equipment. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=45.36s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=50.4s)]
*  have a great country and to live happily without death. And I'd like to see that. That's my first [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=55.84s)]
*  option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. And I think Iran is [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=62.96s)]
*  wanting to talk. I hope they're wanting to talk. It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=72.16s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. I know the Iranian people, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  they're incredible people, always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=84.8s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. I really don't. But [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. It's pretty simple. It's really simple. We're not looking to [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  take their industry. We're not looking to take their land. We're not always saying, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=102.96s)]
*  you can't have a nuclear weapon. The deal that was made with Obama, this deal would have expired [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=108.96s)]
*  already. It was a terrible deal. It would have expired. And that gave them a clear path to a [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=116.56s)]
*  nuclear weapon. I wouldn't have accepted it. That's why I terminated the deal. Number one, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=122.88s)]
*  it was way too short. You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=126.8s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. And I terminated that. And it was a great termination [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=132.32s)]
*  because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated. You know what the deal was. It was a [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=139.2s)]
*  terrible deal. Really. One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. But no, I want, I'd like to see [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  Iran thrive. And they can do that, I think, very easily. Or they can do it the other way. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=151.6s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. It's going to be really bad for them. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo6Ld7p6hVo&t=158.72s)]
