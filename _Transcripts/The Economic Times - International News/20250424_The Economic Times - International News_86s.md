# Why did Michelle Obama skip Trump's second inauguration? Former first lady explains herself
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E)
*  My decision to skip the inauguration, you know, what people don't realize, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=0.0s)]
*  or my decision to make choices at the beginning of this year that suited me, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=5.0s)]
*  were met with such ridicule and criticism, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=10.42s)]
*  like people couldn't believe that I was saying no for any other reason, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=13.76s)]
*  that they had to assume that my marriage was falling apart. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=17.68s)]
*  You know? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=21.14s)]
*  It's like, while I'm here really trying to own my life and intentionally practice [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=22.56s)]
*  making the choice that was right for me, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=29.4s)]
*  and it took everything in my power to not do the thing that was right, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=31.72s)]
*  or that was perceived as right, but do the thing that was right for me. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=37.28s)]
*  That was a hard thing for me to do. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=44.2s)]
*  I had to basically trick myself out of it, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=47.08s)]
*  and it started with not having anything to wear. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=49.459999999999994s)]
*  I mean, I had affirmatively, because I'm always prepared for any funeral, anything. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  I walk around with the right dress. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=57.8s)]
*  I travel with clothes just in case something pops off. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=60.12s)]
*  So I was like, if I'm not going to do this thing, I got to tell my team, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=64.12s)]
*  I don't even want to have a dress ready, right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=69.0s)]
*  Because it's so easy to just say, let me do the right thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sgikml_R4E&t=71.88s)]
