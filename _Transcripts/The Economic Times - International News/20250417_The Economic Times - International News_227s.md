Video Description: President Trump expressed support for the Supreme Court's decision to hear a case on ending birthright citizenship, claiming the constitutional clause is rooted in slavery, not modern immigration. ‘Birthright citizenship was about slavery,’ he said. ‘It’s not about tourists coming in and touching a piece of sand and suddenly being a citizen.’ Trump called the case ‘so misunderstood’ and said he’s ‘so happy’ the Court is finally reviewing it.

# Trump says birthright citizenship ‘rooted in slavery’,  as SCOTUS reviews case
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0)
*  So misunderstood. That case, birthright citizenship, is about slavery. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=0.0s)]
*  If you look at the details of it, the signings of it, everything else, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=6.4s)]
*  that case is all about slavery. They use it now instead, not for slavery, they use it for [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  people that come into our country and they walk in and all of a sudden they become citizens and [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=16.96s)]
*  they pay a lot of money to different cartels and others. It's all about slavery and if you look at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=21.68s)]
*  it that way, we should win that case. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=28.48s)]
*  The Supreme Court agreed to hear oral arguments in the case about ending birthright citizenship. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=30.8s)]
*  How confident are you that the court will rule in your favor and allow that order to end birthright citizenship to go forward? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=36.32s)]
*  Well you're just telling me that for the first time. I am so happy. I think the case has been [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  so misunderstood. That case, birthright citizenship, is about slavery. If you look at the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=47.36s)]
*  details of it, the signings of it, everything else, that case is all about slavery and if you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  view it from that standpoint, people understand it. But for some reason, lawyers don't talk about it, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=62.32s)]
*  the news doesn't talk about it. That's not about tourists coming in and touching a piece of sand [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=68.24s)]
*  and all of a sudden they're a citizenship. You know, they're a citizen. That is all about [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=73.36s)]
*  slavery and even look at the dates on which it was signed. It was right at that era during, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=78.88s)]
*  right after the Civil War and if you look at it that way, the case is an easy case to win. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=86.16s)]
*  And I hope the lawyers talk about birthright citizenship and slavery because that's what [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=93.52s)]
*  it was all about and it was a very positive, it was meant to be positive and they use it now instead, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=99.92s)]
*  not for slavery, they use it for people that come into our country and they walk in and all of a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=106.4s)]
*  sudden they become citizens and they pay a lot of money to different cartels and others. It's all [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=111.84s)]
*  about slavery and if you look at it that way, we should win that case. Okay. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, it follows up that we have a great relationship with the President of El Salvador. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  Will you ask him to release a regular Garcia so that you can facilitate his return here to the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=128.48000000000002s)]
*  United States? Do you believe he deserves due process here? Well, I must tell you, I have to [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=133.44s)]
*  refer again to the lawyers. I'll have to do what they ask me to do. I had heard that there were a [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=138.48s)]
*  lot of things about a certain gentleman, perhaps it was that gentleman, that would make that case [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=144.48s)]
*  be a case that's easily winnable on appeal. So we'll just have to see. I'm going to have to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=151.28s)]
*  respond to the lawyers. Mr. President, we're learning that there are now two deceased following [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=155.6s)]
*  that shooting at Florida State University. Following and amid that, is there any changes [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=160.32s)]
*  that you want to see to gun legislation? Anything you see broken with gun laws? Well, I'm going to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=165.2s)]
*  have to look. I'm a big advocate of the Second Amendment. I have been from the beginning. I [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=169.68s)]
*  protected it and these things are terrible, but the gun doesn't do the shooting. The people do. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=173.84s)]
*  It's, you know, a phrase that's used probably too often. I will tell you that it's a shame. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=181.84s)]
*  I'm just hearing about it now. I just hear about it. I know the area very well. I know the school [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=189.44s)]
*  very well, know everything about it. It's Florida and we'll have more to say about it later. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=195.04s)]
*  What do you mean you say there will be more to say about it? Only in terms of what happened. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=199.68s)]
*  As far as legislation is concerned, this has been going on for a long time. I have an obligation [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=205.44s)]
*  to protect the Second Amendment. I ran on the Second Amendment among many other things [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=210.88s)]
*  and I will always protect the Second Amendment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsorlVEjpT0&t=214.96s)]
