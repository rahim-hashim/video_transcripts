# Canada Elections 2025 | Pierre Poilievre attacks Justin Trudeau’s father in Ontario rally
**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8)
*  That Pierre Elliott Trudeau, then prime minister, would get so frazzled and angry by these questions, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=0.0s)]
*  he would actually have to leave and go behind the House of Commons curtain and storm up and down. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  There was a time when I was a young man in parliament and I was making a lot of comments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=10.8s)]
*  My mouth was moving faster than my brain, you know, at that age when you... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  A platform that cuts government spending by 55 billion dollars with less bureaucracy, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  less consultants, less foreign aid, less waste and mismanagement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=27.4s)]
*  This election comes down to one word, one word only, change. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=34.199999999999996s)]
*  Change, change, change, change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=39.0s)]
*  Change, change, change, change, change. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=41.8s)]
*  We need change. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  Because after a lost liberal decade of rising costs of living and crime, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=49.8s)]
*  we cannot afford a fourth liberal term. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=55.2s)]
*  We need a real change. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=59.0s)]
*  Change so you can afford food, change so you can afford housing, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=61.2s)]
*  change so you feel safe in your country under our proud flag again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=65.2s)]
*  That's what this election is about. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=69.2s)]
*  Before I get into the speech, I have to take a moment to celebrate the legend... [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=75.80000000000001s)]
*  Look at these incredible people we have here. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=81.60000000000001s)]
*  Look at these, what a great... [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=83.8s)]
*  Incredibly hardworking people of Nova Scotia and in particular, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=88.0s)]
*  the legendary McKay family. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=92.2s)]
*  Give it up for the McKays. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=94.6s)]
*  Elmer. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=97.2s)]
*  Starting with Elmer, legendary parliamentarian, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=101.6s)]
*  made way for Brian Mulrooney, served in parliament. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=104.8s)]
*  He used to ask such precise and logical questions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=108.0s)]
*  Story, the legend has it that Pierre Elliott Trudeau, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=112.4s)]
*  then prime minister, would get so frazzled and angry by these questions, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  he would actually have to leave and go behind the House of Commons curtain [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  and storm up and down in a huff. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=124.0s)]
*  But of course, Elmer is a man of words. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, at the last rally he attended, he suddenly took the mic away from me [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=131.6s)]
*  and began reciting a perfectly relevant excerpt of Shakespeare [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=135.6s)]
*  from the top of his head. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=140.8s)]
*  He's been a great businessman. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=143.20000000000002s)]
*  The McKay family has so many generations of contribution. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=146.0s)]
*  The stories that I hear of generations gone by [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=151.0s)]
*  where a poor family was struggling to physically build a home with their own hands. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=155.0s)]
*  They ran out of lumber. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=160.4s)]
*  And one day, a big pile of two-by-fours and other wood [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=162.0s)]
*  just suddenly and magically appeared on their property. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=167.6s)]
*  And they asked the neighbors, where did it come from? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=171.0s)]
*  Well, said the McKay family heard that you run out of lumber [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=173.2s)]
*  and of course they're in the lumber business and so they dropped it off. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  And the family said, well, why did they do that? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=179.2s)]
*  They don't even know me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=182.0s)]
*  But because that's what the McKays do. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=183.4s)]
*  Isn't that the sort of... [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=185.6s)]
*  The stories of single mothers and widows who were hungry [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=187.8s)]
*  and unable to buy a turkey dinner before Thanksgiving [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=192.8s)]
*  and a ring at the doorbell would hit [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=196.60000000000002s)]
*  and all of a sudden there would be a nice beautiful frozen turkey [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  left there by their then member of parliament. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  And then we've got Peter McKay, the great Harper-era minister [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=205.0s)]
*  who served our country so well for so long [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  that he's been a great businessman. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=212.8s)]
*  The great Harper-era minister who served our country so well for so long, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=215.4s)]
*  defense minister, justice minister, foreign affairs minister. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=219.4s)]
*  You know, there was a time when I was a young man in parliament [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=227.4s)]
*  and I was making a lot of comments. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=231.8s)]
*  My mouth was moving faster than my brain, you know, at that age. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=234.8s)]
*  I got into hot water a few times. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=238.8s)]
*  I was waiting for Peter for a little bit of mentorship. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=241.4s)]
*  And he brought me into his office. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=244.4s)]
*  He was very calm and stoic. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=246.4s)]
*  And he sat me down and behind him on the wall was a stuffed fish [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=248.4s)]
*  that he'd brought from Atlantic Canada, proudly displayed on the wall. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=253.4s)]
*  And I said, Peter, what's your advice? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=258.4s)]
*  And he said, well, you see that fish up there? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=260.4s)]
*  If he'd kept his mouth shut, he'd still be alive. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=262.4s)]
*  Peter, as you know, were you nominated in this room right here? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=271.4s)]
*  Was this the place where you won your nomination? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=274.4s)]
*  Mulroney was nominated here. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=276.4s)]
*  John A. McDonald? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=278.4s)]
*  Okay, you didn't know John A. McDonald. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=282.4s)]
*  You're not that old, Peter. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=284.4s)]
*  Peter started his campaign when he was... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=289.4s)]
*  What, you were 28 when you were nominated? [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=291.4s)]
*  30. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=293.4s)]
*  Okay, but you looked 28 at the time. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=294.4s)]
*  He still looks great, eh? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=296.4s)]
*  He looks like a Roman god, this guy, or something. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=298.4s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=300.4s)]
*  Peter wasn't born, by the way. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=303.4s)]
*  He was chiseled out of a big block of marble. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=305.4s)]
*  We're embarrassing him. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=309.4s)]
*  When he first ran for office, he said, we have to go visit our seniors. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=311.4s)]
*  They built this country. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=315.4s)]
*  And he showed up at his seniors' home, and he walked up to a lady, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=317.4s)]
*  and she said, do you know who I am? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=320.4s)]
*  And she said, no, but if you ask the nurse, she'll tell you who you are. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=323.4s)]
*  I think he's used that one on me a few times. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=327.4s)]
*  But he was a great minister in our government. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=330.4s)]
*  He gives so much wisdom, and he reminds us all of how good things were in the past [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=333.4s)]
*  and how much better they can be in the future. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=338.4s)]
*  Peter McKay is another reason for us to have hope. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=341.4s)]
*  And boy, do we ever need hope these days, though. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=344.4s)]
*  My goodness. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=347.4s)]
*  Have you ever seen it this bad? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=348.4s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=350.4s)]
*  What an absolute mess the liberals have made of our country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=352.4s)]
*  I need you, too. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=355.4s)]
*  I need you to get out and vote. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=357.4s)]
*  Have you all voted yet for a change? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=359.4s)]
*  Well, I'm going to have to go. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=364.4s)]
*  I'm going to have to go. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=366.4s)]
*  I'm going to have to go. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=368.4s)]
*  I'm going to have to go. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=370.4s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you why it's so important to vote. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=373.4s)]
*  Because not only will things not get better if you don't vote, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=377.4s)]
*  they'll get a lot worse. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=383.4s)]
*  Look at the mess we're in after the last liberal decade. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=385.4s)]
*  Everything costs more. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=388.4s)]
*  Food prices have risen 37% faster in Canada [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=390.4s)]
*  than they did in the United States over the last five years [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=393.4s)]
*  while Mark Carney was Justin Trudeau's top economic adviser. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=396.4s)]
*  Housing costs have doubled after out-of-control immigration [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=400.4s)]
*  and money printing extremely goosed the demand [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=406.4s)]
*  while government bureaucracy blocked home building, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=411.4s)]
*  in other words, stopping supply. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=414.4s)]
*  Imagine if government subsidizes the demand for something [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=417.4s)]
*  and then blocks the supply of that same thing, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=421.4s)]
*  the laws of economics dictate that it's going to become extremely unaffordable. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=424.4s)]
*  So the major causes of this were the immigration minister [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=429.4s)]
*  and the housing minister. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=433.4s)]
*  It turns out it's the same guy. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=435.4s)]
*  One guy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=441.4s)]
*  So Sean Frazier is the immigration minister, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=446.4s)]
*  increases our population growth by literally 200% [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=448.4s)]
*  to 1.3 million people [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=454.4s)]
*  in a time when we're only building about 200,000 homes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=457.4s)]
*  And then as a punishment for that failure, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=461.4s)]
*  that catastrophic mistake, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=465.4s)]
*  they then move him over to make him housing minister, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=467.4s)]
*  where he gives us the single most unaffordable housing market [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=471.4s)]
*  in the history of the country and among all G7 nations. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=475.4s)]
*  And, you know, we thought that maybe he had a little bit of shame, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=479.4s)]
*  he was going to go into retirement, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=483.4s)]
*  as you would think, after a catastrophic record [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=485.4s)]
*  of ruining both immigration and housing, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=489.4s)]
*  he would want to disappear quietly into obscurity. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=491.4s)]
*  But then Mark Carney said, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=495.4s)]
*  the kind of guy who ruins housing and immigration [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=497.4s)]
*  is exactly the kind of guy I need back in my cabinet. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=500.4s)]
*  And that's all you need to know about Mark Carney. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=503.4s)]
*  Now, liberals would like you to forget about the last lost liberal decade. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=507.4s)]
*  They say, you know, let's just ignore whatever happened. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=514.4s)]
*  Pretend it wasn't there, even though all the same liberal MPs, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=517.4s)]
*  liberal ministers, liberal advisors, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=520.4s)]
*  are still running the liberal show. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=522.4s)]
*  But I'm here to tell you that that liberal record [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=525.4s)]
*  is not just about the past, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=529.4s)]
*  it's about a very dark future if they're re-elected. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=531.4s)]
*  Now, don't take my word for it. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=535.4s)]
*  Look at this report. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=537.4s)]
*  This is from the government of Canada. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=538.4s)]
*  It's got the logo of the government right here. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=540.4s)]
*  Here, look real close so the media can't deny that it comes from the government. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=542.4s)]
*  It says Canada at the bottom. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=547.4s)]
*  It's got the Canada logo. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=549.4s)]
*  And the government has confirmed this is a real document. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=551.4s)]
*  The reason I have to say that is because its findings are so horrific. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=553.4s)]
*  They predict what Canada will look like on the current trajectory. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=557.4s)]
*  Now, let me turn to page three. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=562.4s)]
*  And the section is actually entitled, and I'm quoting here, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=564.4s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=568.4s)]
*  That's what I think. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=573.4s)]
*  It's written down right here. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=574.4s)]
*  In 2040, they predict, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=575.4s)]
*  Now, this is bureaucraties. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=594.4s)]
*  But I can translate. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=597.4s)]
*  I've been reading bureaucraties in the government for long enough. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=598.4s)]
*  What this means is no matter how hard you work, you won't be able to get ahead. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=601.4s)]
*  In fact, you might start falling behind. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=605.4s)]
*  Then they say that pursuing a post-secondary education [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=608.4s)]
*  will no longer be considered a reliable path to social mobility. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=612.4s)]
*  In other words, you can study all you want, you can learn all you want, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=615.4s)]
*  you still won't get ahead. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=618.4s)]
*  Then they say in 2040, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=620.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=623.4s)]
*  People see inheritance as the only way to get ahead. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=624.4s)]
*  Society, listen to this. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=628.4s)]
*  Society, and I'm quoting, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=630.4s)]
*  society increasingly resembles an aristocracy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=632.4s)]
*  Wealth and status pass down the generations. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=637.4s)]
*  Family background, especially owning property, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=640.4s)]
*  divides the haves and the have-nots. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=643.4s)]
*  In 2040, people rarely mix with others of different socioeconomic status. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=647.4s)]
*  In other words, there's a tiny group of aristocrats on the top, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=652.4s)]
*  and everyone else is left behind. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=656.4s)]
*  They don't even talk to each other. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=659.4s)]
*  Then they go on to say in this report, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=661.4s)]
*  the Canadian economy could shrink and become less predictable. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=663.4s)]
*  Property capital for investment in new enterprises [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=668.4s)]
*  may concentrate in the hands of a small number of very wealthy older people. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=672.4s)]
*  Property ownership, and by extension wealth, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=676.4s)]
*  may become even more concentrated if generations abandon the idea [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=679.4s)]
*  of single-family dwellings in favor of renting or forming alternative households. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=683.4s)]
*  That's exactly the liberal ideology. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=688.4s)]
*  That nobody should own a home, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=690.4s)]
*  everyone should just be stuck paying exorbitant rents [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=692.4s)]
*  in properties not big enough to raise families. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=696.4s)]
*  Then they say people's mental health will suffer. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=699.4s)]
*  More people struggle to afford rent, bills, and groceries. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=702.4s)]
*  The resulting stress could worsen mental health challenges. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=707.4s)]
*  This would increase demand for social services. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=711.4s)]
*  Now, this last line is really most startling of all. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=715.4s)]
*  They believe that people might have to look for alternative means of seeking sustenance, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=719.4s)]
*  because food prices will become so unaffordable [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=725.4s)]
*  that no longer will working-class people be able to go to the grocery store anymore. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=729.4s)]
*  So we will go from what we have now, which is people go up to the till, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=735.4s)]
*  and when they're paying, they actually have to put things back in the bag [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=740.4s)]
*  and send them back because the bank of count is emptied [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=744.4s)]
*  before they've gotten through the entire bill. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=747.4s)]
*  Worse than that, they say people will have to hunt, fish, and forage [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=750.4s)]
*  on public lands and waterways without reference to regulations. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=754.4s)]
*  In other words, people will be in a position where they will need [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=759.4s)]
*  to feed themselves. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=763.4s)]
*  That's right. That's a good point. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=766.4s)]
*  You know, it's funny. You make a great point. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=769.4s)]
*  CBC the other day had a panel about this report, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=772.4s)]
*  and of course the CBC talking head was saying, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=775.4s)]
*  oh, come on, this is so exaggerated. That's never going to happen in Canada. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=778.4s)]
*  And to her credit, one of the Globe and Mail reporters said, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=782.4s)]
*  wait a sec here, for a lot of Canadians, this is the way it is right now. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=785.4s)]
*  My friends, there are people in this country just hanging on by a thread, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=789.4s)]
*  and it is for those people that we are fighting. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=794.4s)]
*  We are here to give them hope and change and a better future. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=796.4s)]
*  And we have the plan to do it. This is it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=813.4s)]
*  This is it. The Change Book. Change. Change for an affordable life. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=816.4s)]
*  Change for safe streets. Change for Canada First is our platform. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=821.4s)]
*  Newly released. A platform that cuts government spending by $55 billion [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=825.4s)]
*  with less bureaucracy, less consultants, less foreign aid, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=830.4s)]
*  less waste and mismanagement. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=835.4s)]
*  To bring down the deficit by 70% reducing the amount we are adding on to our debt. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=837.4s)]
*  We will cut income tax by 15% so your hard work pays off again. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=847.4s)]
*  We will axe the sales tax on new homes so that you can save money and buy a place [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=858.4s)]
*  and put a roof over your head. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=863.4s)]
*  And we will lock up the violent criminals the liberals have put on the streets [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=865.4s)]
*  so you are safe in your community. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NugvoklNU8&t=872.4s)]
