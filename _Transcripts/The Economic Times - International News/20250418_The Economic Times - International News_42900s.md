Video Description: US President Donald Trump said Thursday that he is in “no rush” to reach any trade deals because of the revenues his tariffs are generating, but he suggested, while meeting with Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, that it would be easy to find an agreement with the European Union and others. Trump played down the likelihood of an accelerated timeline to wrap up deals, saying any agreements would come “at a certain point.” “We're in no rush,” said Trump, hinting that he has leverage because other countries want access to U.S. consumers.

**The Economic Times - International News:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI)
*  I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tallahassee, active shooting. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3.74s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7.04s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now, it's a shame. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10.64s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13.94s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15.64s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19.18s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22.38s)]
*  Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25.98s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31.22s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36.42s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39.22s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=41.96s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=44.260000000000005s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=51.7s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=55.720000000000006s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=60.540000000000006s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=61.940000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=63.6s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=65.38s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  our friendship that comes from Grifo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=72.68s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=75.12s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=77.72s)]
*  Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=83.52s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties, but also to remind that we both [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=86.42s)]
*  share another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=93.82s)]
*  that would like to erase our history. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=101.0s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=103.8s)]
*  on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=111.16s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=114.3s)]
*  for example. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=119.44s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=120.78s)]
*  do together about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=127.08s)]
*  about energy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=135.72s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  trying to develop. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=146.96s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billions. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=159.76000000000002s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=164.44000000000003s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=168.2s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=174.29999999999998s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the next week. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=180.6s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=187.17999999999998s)]
*  such a Western nationalism. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=190.88s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=192.92s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  geographical space. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=199.3s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=200.84s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=203.3s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems, okay, between the two shores of [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=211.32s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=216.8s)]
*  an official visit to Rome in the near future and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=225.66s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=231.1s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=234.26s)]
*  We can. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=236.26s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=241.82s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  and I think that today has a very good situation despite the difficulties. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=246.78s)]
*  A stable country, a reliable country, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=253.96s)]
*  one million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=256.96s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=260.72s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=261.88s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=263.32s)]
*  you're a businessman and you understand me. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=267.48s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60%. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=270.04s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=273.52s)]
*  I think we can do it even better together. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=275.18s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=277.52000000000004s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=279.44s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=281.48s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=283.68s)]
*  Good. Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=286.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=286.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=287.76000000000005s)]
*  And we'll see if we can. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=291.76000000000005s)]
*  We want to save. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=293.36s)]
*  On average, think of it, every week 2,500 people are being killed, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=294.72s)]
*  mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=298.92s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=302.24s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=305.36s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll let you know very soon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=306.84s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=310.59999999999997s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=311.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  Any questions? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=313.4s)]
*  Mr. President, how much longer does Wagner-Kuhn have to respond to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=314.08s)]
*  your ceasefire proposal before you put secondary terrorists or [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=322.12s)]
*  sanctions on Russia? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=326.24s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=328.28s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly actually. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=330.12s)]
*  And we'll see. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=336.0s)]
*  But we want it to stop. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=336.84s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=338.15999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=340.68s)]
*  Jerome Powell cannot come fast enough. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=345.36s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=347.52s)]
*  He'll leave. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=350.4s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  But I don't think he's doing the job. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=352.64s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=357.92s)]
*  I let him know it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=365.0s)]
*  And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=366.68s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=371.68s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=373.28s)]
*  Question? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=374.56s)]
*  Are you trying to remove him as your president? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=375.4s)]
*  Yeah, question? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=376.92s)]
*  Mr. President, would you hesitate to judge both for any kind of case against [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=377.6s)]
*  your administration? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=382.28s)]
*  Mr. President, the Constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=383.64s)]
*  judicial order. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=387.0s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=387.8s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=389.12s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=390.56s)]
*  I can tell you this, we're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  of this country who Biden allowed into the country. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=396.36s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, I would say maybe that was the number one [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=405.12s)]
*  fact for a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=410.0s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=412.4s)]
*  get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=416.79999999999995s)]

*  I'm going to get them out. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=422.32s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=423.96s)]
*  We won everything. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=428.71999999999997s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states, we won everything. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=429.56s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted, and that's what I'm doing. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=433.32s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=437.28s)]
*  Sir, what do you think of the proposal from France and UK about peace mission in Ukraine [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=439.92s)]
*  with soldiers, and do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=448.6s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=451.32s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=455.12s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=457.68s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=458.96000000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=459.6s)]
*  foreign minister, is it Italy, the United States, and Europe? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=464.24s)]
*  And China? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=468.32s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=469.68s)]
*  No, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=471.12s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=475.6s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=480.24s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=483.44s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=485.64s)]
*  Would you say something, please? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=486.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=487.44s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=489.08000000000004s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=492.96000000000004s)]
*  I believe there's been calls with the EU already. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=496.8s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=500.0s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=502.88s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=507.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=508.96s)]
*  Great, sir. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky, you just said China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=513.3199999999999s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=520.08s)]
*  Also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=522.04s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=525.4s)]
*  next Thursday. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=529.32s)]
*  Soon. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=530.84s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=532.04s)]
*  So we'll see. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=534.4s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=535.12s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=538.84s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=540.28s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=541.28s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=543.52s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=549.32s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=550.08s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=552.08s)]
*  You waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=553.72s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=558.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=565.84s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=569.5600000000001s)]
*  That's my first option. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=570.5600000000001s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=573.36s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=578.6s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=582.92s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=584.12s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=586.08s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=592.0s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=594.96s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=599.56s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=603.68s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=604.32s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=607.08s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=608.76s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=610.48s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=613.28s)]
*  We're not — all we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=615.72s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama — that deal would have expired already. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=619.48s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=625.28s)]
*  It would have expired. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=626.9200000000001s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=629.12s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=632.24s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=633.28s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=634.72s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=636.8s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=640.72s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=643.24s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=646.16s)]
*  Once it terminated — you know what the deal was. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=649.64s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=651.56s)]
*  Really. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=653.16s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=653.76s)]
*  But, no, I want — I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=657.48s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=662.12s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=664.76s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=667.12s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=669.08s)]
*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=678.52s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=680.28s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=681.6s)]
*  He loves our country. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=686.24s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=687.08s)]
*  — steps to return Kilmar of Arrego Garcia to the United States [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=694.76s)]
*  and put him in front of a judge? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=698.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=699.92s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=701.28s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=707.16s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=709.4s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=714.28s)]
*  many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=720.36s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=723.0s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=725.36s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=729.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=733.6800000000001s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=737.72s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=742.84s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=747.36s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=750.7199999999999s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=755.04s)]
*  Tom Hulman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=756.28s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=763.04s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=764.4s)]
*  We have, right now, a 99 percent border. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=766.68s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=769.3599999999999s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be — nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=770.9599999999999s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=776.0s)]
*  We allowed them. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=779.16s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=779.8399999999999s)]
*  And all for medical reasons. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=783.92s)]
*  We have a great border. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=787.12s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=788.0s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=793.04s)]
*  And, you know, we have to — we need — we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=795.8399999999999s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible — you know, they released jails, Georgia, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=802.28s)]
*  from all over the world, and released them — not just South America, all over the world. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=808.84s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=813.24s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=815.32s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=817.0s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=820.6s)]
*  Venezuela. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=823.64s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=825.32s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=827.96s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=834.9200000000001s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=838.12s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=842.76s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=848.04s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=853.7199999999999s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=855.8s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=861.8s)]
*  Do you think, Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done, [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=867.4s)]
*  but you also said that you're in no rush. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=873.48s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=875.16s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=876.8399999999999s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=878.28s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=882.12s)]
*  because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=885.8s)]
*  you have gasoline that hit a dollar and 98 yesterday in a couple of states. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=890.68s)]
*  You have gasoline's way down. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=896.5999999999999s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=898.04s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=901.9599999999999s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=905.24s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=907.7199999999999s)]
*  I just got there. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=910.76s)]
*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=911.56s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=913.88s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=915.48s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=917.16s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=922.5999999999999s)]
*  You're fake. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=925.64s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=926.68s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=930.4399999999999s)]
*  I just, this is my seventh day. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=931.88s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=934.36s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=935.08s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=937.56s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=940.52s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=942.1999999999999s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=944.36s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=945.88s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=951.0s)]
*  Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=953.48s)]
*  They've really done a fantastic job. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=957.08s)]
*  So price has never gone up. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=958.9200000000001s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=960.2s)]
*  because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=963.48s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=968.6800000000001s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=971.72s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=974.2800000000001s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=975.8000000000001s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=978.52s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=981.96s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=985.0799999999999s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=987.56s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=991.72s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=994.1999999999999s)]
*  because they're not very smart people. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=996.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1002.12s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1002.4399999999999s)]
*  Please. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1003.0s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1004.36s)]
*  Please. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1004.68s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1009.3199999999999s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1012.76s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1013.96s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1016.84s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration economically [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1019.72s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1022.76s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1025.08s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1027.08s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1032.04s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1035.4s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1038.1200000000001s)]
*  that they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real president. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1042.1200000000001s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1045.64s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1049.48s)]
*  but they didn't understand business or they didn't like business [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1053.72s)]
*  or it wasn't like a priority. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1056.8400000000001s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1059.3200000000002s)]
*  the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1061.24s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1063.64s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1064.76s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1066.2800000000002s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1067.24s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1070.68s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1071.72s)]
*  You know why? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1073.96s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1075.48s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1077.8s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1079.96s)]
*  when this all happens. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1083.72s)]
*  It's happening now. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1085.0s)]
*  Everybody wants to make a deal. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1086.2s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1087.64s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1090.76s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1092.1200000000001s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1094.52s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1096.52s)]
*  that are working on it that we're listening [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1103.32s)]
*  and we're going to be very fair to people. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1106.68s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1109.48s)]
*  and that's what we'll be doing. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1112.12s)]
*  Okay? [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1113.72s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1116.12s)]
*  Please. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1118.2s)]
*  A question. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1118.7s)]
*  Today, our Prime Minister. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1119.48s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1121.3999999999999s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1123.08s)]
*  He does. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1123.8s)]
*  In Italian. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1124.3s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1125.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1126.28s)]
*  I'm not sure that you are right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1127.0s)]
*  I think that sounded absolutely... [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1185.24s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1208.68s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1209.88s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1211.88s)]
*  Please. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1212.68s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1214.14s)]
*  It was about... [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1215.74s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1216.46s)]
*  But maybe I could hear what she said. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1218.78s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1222.14s)]
*  It was about asking... [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1222.64s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1226.78s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1227.66s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1229.3400000000001s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1230.3s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1231.98s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1235.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, the President, Prime Minister Maroney [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1235.6000000000001s)]
*  was asked whether what she thinks about the fact [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1238.6200000000001s)]
*  that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1241.6599999999999s)]
*  And Prime Minister Maroney answered, well, actually, we have... [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1248.1399999999999s)]
*  No, and also, if you talked about the military spending, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1257.34s)]
*  how... and the raising of the military spending. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1262.2199999999998s)]
*  And the fact... [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1264.78s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Maroney said is that, [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1265.34s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raising of military spending. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1269.34s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2%. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1273.4199999999998s)]
*  And then we will see, because we are absolutely aware of the fact that [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1277.74s)]
*  it is very important to... [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1281.1799999999998s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1284.22s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1284.78s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1285.82s)]
*  I will do that. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1286.1399999999999s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defensive percentage about the defense spending. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1286.86s)]
*  And I said, yes, NATO. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1294.62s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2% as it was already decided. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1296.3799999999999s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1301.8999999999999s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1305.98s)]
*  And we see, well, also the war that we are trying to do at the European left. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1311.02s)]
*  And I don't hold... [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1316.3s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1317.58s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1320.3s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1325.5s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1329.18s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1332.46s)]
*  and then they'd have beautiful terraces. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1334.7s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1336.46s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1339.42s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1340.94s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1346.22s)]
*  So I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1350.46s)]
*  I think it's a war. I know it's a war. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1355.1s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. It was never close to happening. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1357.34s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1360.1399999999999s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1362.06s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1364.3s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1365.5s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1368.78s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1376.1399999999999s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1378.78s)]
*  that you can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1384.54s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1388.7s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that, and everybody agrees to it, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1390.46s)]
*  if I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1393.74s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1396.3799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1400.54s)]
*  Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1403.02s)]

*  Could you say that again? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1427.42s)]
*  He's never said it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1430.46s)]
*  Could you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1431.2600000000002s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1433.2600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1435.42s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1436.14s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1436.8600000000001s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1437.98s)]

*  Sure. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1455.8200000000002s)]
*  Did you, I guess that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1456.7800000000002s)]
*  how are you going to do that? [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1462.22s)]
*  And are you looking to do it to counter China? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1466.9399999999998s)]

*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1474.22s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1476.46s)]
*  and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1478.22s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1481.26s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1486.22s)]
*  because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1488.7s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1493.1s)]
*  that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1494.3s)]
*  And I commented to her before, I said, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1499.6599999999999s)]
*  I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1502.06s)]
*  but they're not. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1505.1s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1507.74s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1509.58s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1511.34s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1513.1799999999998s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1516.54s)]
*  You've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1519.5s)]
*  let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1523.74s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1526.06s)]
*  how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1529.4199999999998s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1533.1s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1537.58s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1542.7s)]
*  repatriations and things like that. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1547.1s)]
*  So things are changing, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1549.02s)]
*  thanks also to the example that Italy brought in [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1550.94s)]
*  lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1555.42s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1558.22s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1561.58s)]
*  Only if you have discussed the option of starting here with Italy [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1571.98s)]
*  on satellite communications. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1575.66s)]
*  And President Trump, if you want to see the Google company... [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1577.34s)]
*  The Google what? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1583.18s)]
*  The Google company. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1584.14s)]
*  What about... [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1585.58s)]
*  The Google business. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1586.06s)]
*  If you want to see it, you can do it now. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1586.8600000000001s)]
*  It's a great... [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1588.3s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1589.1s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1590.14s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1594.22s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1598.3s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1602.3s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1619.42s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1621.5s)]
*  Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1625.9s)]
*  And now that's that whole tide has turned. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1629.58s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1632.54s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1634.3s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25% on cars, 25% on steel, 25% on aluminum, 10% baseline. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1635.34s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1644.3s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1647.58s)]
*  25% for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1650.6999999999998s)]
*  And now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1657.9s)]
*  And we didn't do... [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1663.74s)]
*  We didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1664.8600000000001s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China, where we took in up until this point, probably $700 billion. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1669.66s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1676.38s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1677.66s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1679.66s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1680.8600000000001s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1682.7s)]
*  He did. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1684.3s)]
*  And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1685.66s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1689.5800000000002s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1694.7s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1697.9s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1706.46s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1708.22s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1711.74s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1714.86s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1716.94s)]
*  that had an impact on the stock market. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1722.06s)]
*  But this is about that. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1723.98s)]
*  This is really we're building a base. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1725.74s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1727.5s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1729.98s)]
*  history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1734.3s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1738.78s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1741.74s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1752.3s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1753.58s)]
*  Where would it be signed and what? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1754.3s)]
*  And we're still working on the details. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1755.82s)]
*  We're shooting for around eight or 20 seconds. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1757.82s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1760.22s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously, but the president was here. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1764.7s)]
*  We had a numbering of understanding. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1770.86s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an 80-page agreement. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1773.02s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1778.2199999999998s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell's firing if he doesn't change his stand on rate cuts? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1785.5s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1791.26s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1793.1s)]
*  it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1797.9799999999998s)]
*  He plays right into their hands. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1800.7s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1803.0200000000002s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1804.6200000000001s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1806.22s)]
*  Oil is great. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1809.74s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1811.66s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1813.74s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1815.74s)]
*  And I told you in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1822.22s)]
*  And food is down. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1827.18s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1830.22s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1834.46s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1836.38s)]
*  It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1838.46s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1842.06s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1846.14s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1848.22s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1849.5s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1851.42s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1855.42s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1858.3799999999999s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1859.74s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1863.02s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1867.02s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1869.1s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1871.66s)]
*  instead of $4.50. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1876.54s)]
*  And even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1879.1s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1884.94s)]
*  That was really, it was not good. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1887.74s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1890.22s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1897.58s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1900.22s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1902.06s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1903.66s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1908.14s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1915.5s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1917.58s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1920.78s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1923.66s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1925.34s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1928.78s)]
*  Okay? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1932.54s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1937.02s)]
*  Please. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1938.3s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1944.94s)]
*  She's doing now. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1950.94s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1951.8999999999999s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1953.02s)]
*  Not just in Europe, anywhere. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1956.22s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1958.54s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1962.3s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1965.02s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1968.3s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1972.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1973.82s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=1988.54s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2000.94s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2002.22s)]
*  Active shooting. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2007.8999999999999s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2008.78s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2012.3799999999999s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2015.18s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2016.3799999999999s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2017.5s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2020.94s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2024.14s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2029.34s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2033.02s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2038.3s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2041.02s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2043.82s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2046.06s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2051.74s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2053.5s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2057.58s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2062.2999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2063.74s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2065.34s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2067.18s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relation, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2070.06s)]
*  our friendship that comes from Grifo. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2074.46s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2076.78s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2079.42s)]
*  Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2085.18s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2088.2200000000003s)]
*  we both share another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2095.18s)]
*  ideology that would like to erase our history. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2101.98s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2105.58s)]
*  on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2112.94s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2116.06s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2122.54s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2130.38s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2140.7s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2149.66s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2153.2599999999998s)]
*  As you know, in the next years, I think around 10 billion. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2161.5s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2166.14s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2169.74s)]
*  It's not only about Italy. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2171.58s)]
*  It's about the entire Europe. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2173.42s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2176.06s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in this week. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2182.38s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2188.94s)]
*  such a Western nationalism. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2192.7s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2194.78s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2196.38s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2202.54s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2204.94s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2207.26s)]
*  it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2213.9s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2218.54s)]
*  to Rome in the near future and consider a possibility in that occasion to meet [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2224.94s)]

*  Go ahead, please. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2375.02s)]
*  Question. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2376.3s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2378.6200000000003s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2390.86s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2392.3s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2394.46s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2395.42s)]
*  Biden allowed into the country. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2399.42s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2401.7400000000002s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2406.86s)]
*  factor a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2411.82s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2414.14s)]
*  I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2418.14s)]
*  stupidly through open borders. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2421.42s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2423.98s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2425.7400000000002s)]
*  As you know, we won everything. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2429.98s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2431.34s)]
*  We won everything. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2434.14s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2435.1s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2437.66s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2438.94s)]
*  Say it. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2441.5s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and UK of a peace mission [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2444.3s)]
*  in Ukraine with soldiers? [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2449.58s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2451.02s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2453.02s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2456.94s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2459.5s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2460.78s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2461.34s)]
*  discussed with the prime minister, the Italy and the United States, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2464.78s)]
*  and Europe and the United States? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2468.7000000000003s)]
*  And China? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2470.38s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2471.42s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2472.86s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2477.5s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2482.06s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2485.1800000000003s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2487.34s)]
*  Would you say something? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2488.06s)]
*  We've been in a process in place. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2489.42s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2490.94s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2494.78s)]
*  I believe it has been called with the EU already. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2498.54s)]
*  And then we have a South Korea coming in next week. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2501.7400000000002s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2504.7000000000003s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2509.26s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2513.9s)]
*  Mr. President, is the US's evidence of China supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2514.64s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2521.84s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2523.2000000000003s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2526.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2527.2000000000003s)]
*  next Thursday. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2531.12s)]
*  Soon. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2532.64s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2533.84s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2536.88s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2540.64s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2542.0s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2543.04s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2544.96s)]
*  Can you comment on that? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2551.04s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2551.84s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2553.76s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2555.44s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2560.48s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2561.68s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2567.6s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2571.28s)]
*  That's my first option. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2572.32s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2575.04s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2580.32s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2584.56s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2585.84s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2587.76s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2593.6800000000003s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2596.72s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2601.28s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2605.28s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2606.0s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2608.8s)]
*  It's really simple. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2610.4s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2612.16s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2614.96s)]
*  We're not always saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2617.44s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2621.12s)]
*  and that deal would have expired already. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2625.36s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2627.04s)]

*  I wouldn't have accepted. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2634.0s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2635.04s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2636.48s)]
*  When countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2642.48s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2645.04s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2647.84s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2651.36s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2653.28s)]
*  Really, one of many terrible deals made by the US. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2654.88s)]
*  But no, I want I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2659.2000000000003s)]

*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2668.8s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2670.7200000000003s)]
*  The Press. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2672.0800000000004s)]

*  But I will say this. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2716.08s)]
*  We were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2719.84s)]
*  administration. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2723.92s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2724.72s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2727.12s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2731.6s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2735.36s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2739.52s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2744.6400000000003s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2749.04s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a President. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2752.48s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2756.7200000000003s)]

*  Far greater than what I said. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2764.8s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2766.1600000000003s)]

*  Nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2774.08s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2777.68s)]
*  We allowed them. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2780.88s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2781.6s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2786.72s)]
*  We have a great border. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2788.8s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2789.76s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2794.72s)]
*  And, you know, we have to we need we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that were [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2796.4s)]

*  They came in, opened their jails. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2822.7200000000003s)]
*  Venezuela. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2824.6400000000003s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2825.92s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2828.48s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2835.52s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2838.7200000000003s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2841.44s)]

*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2848.56s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2854.4s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2856.4s)]
*  Maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2856.96s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2862.32s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2864.8s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals will be done. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2866.48s)]
*  But you also said that you're a no brush. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2874.08s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise or seeing it on their bills. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2875.84s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2878.7200000000003s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2881.92s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2884.7200000000003s)]

*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2896.88s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2900.96s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2904.88s)]

*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2913.52s)]
*  Eggs have gone through the roof. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2915.84s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2917.44s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2919.12s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2924.48s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2928.64s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2932.32s)]
*  This is my seventh day. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2934.08s)]
*  And they were right. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2936.24s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2936.96s)]
*  They said you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2939.44s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2942.4s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2944.08s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2946.2400000000002s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2947.76s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2952.88s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2958.96s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2960.8s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2962.08s)]
*  Because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2965.36s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2970.56s)]

*  As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2980.4s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2983.84s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2986.96s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2989.36s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2993.52s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=2996.0s)]

*  And countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3040.08s)]
*  Because we have a real president. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3045.6s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3047.52s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, but they didn't understand business. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3051.36s)]
*  Or they didn't like business. [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3057.36s)]
*  Or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3058.7200000000003s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3061.2000000000003s)]
*  The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3063.1200000000003s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3065.52s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3066.6400000000003s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3068.1600000000003s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3069.2000000000003s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3072.56s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3073.6s)]
*  You know why? [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3075.84s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3077.36s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3079.68s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3081.8399999999997s)]
*  It's happening now. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3086.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3087.68s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3089.52s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3092.72s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3094.08s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3096.3999999999996s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3097.9199999999996s)]
*  that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3106.8799999999997s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3111.3599999999997s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3114.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3115.6s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3117.92s)]
*  Please. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3120.08s)]
*  Oh, you have a great prime minister. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3123.2799999999997s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3124.96s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3127.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3127.92s)]
*  We've been talking about the maximum cost of the Italian expenses. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3136.16s)]
*  And then, if you talked about the Italian expenses, what are the maximum limits that you think Italy can reach? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3138.96s)]
*  We haven't talked about the maximum limits that Italy can reach. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3146.96s)]
*  We've talked about the fact that Italy is keeping up its commitments, [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3149.6s)]
*  because it will reach the next peak of NATO, with the 2%, which was already planned, [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3153.7599999999998s)]
*  which was signed by the previous governments. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3159.2799999999997s)]
*  We're a serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this percentage will increase, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3162.24s)]
*  even if we're aware that the defense issue is a particularly important issue at this time. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3167.8399999999997s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3173.12s)]
*  I think there was an invasion, and the invader was Putin and Russia, [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3175.36s)]
*  but that's not what reveals the fact that together we want to work, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3185.52s)]
*  and we're working to try to achieve a peace in Ukraine that can be just and lasting. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3191.44s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we're making to share our work. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3196.8s)]
*  We've also shared our voice today. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3201.68s)]
*  That sounded absolutely — that was so beautiful. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3208.16s)]
*  What did she say? [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3213.68s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3216.0s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3218.24s)]
*  But maybe I could hear what she said. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3220.64s)]
*  Hold it. Hold it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3228.64s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3229.52s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3231.2s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3233.92s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3236.96s)]
*  President — Prime Minister Maloney was asked whether — what she thinks about the fact that [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3238.8s)]
*  President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3243.52s)]
*  and Prime Minister Maloney answered, well, actually, we have — no, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3250.0s)]
*  and also if you talked about the military spending, how — and the raising of the military spending, [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3260.4s)]
*  and the fact — and the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that, no, actually, [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3266.7200000000003s)]
*  we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3272.56s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, and then we will see, [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3275.28s)]
*  because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to — [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3280.48s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3285.6800000000003s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I will do that. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3287.6800000000003s)]
*  They've been asking if we raise — if we decided another defense percentage about the [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3288.8s)]
*  defense spending. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3295.04s)]
*  Right, NATO. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3295.84s)]
*  Yes, NATO. And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3297.28s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3303.76s)]
*  defense is important for the future, and we see, well, also the work that we are trying to do at [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3309.44s)]
*  the European level. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3315.92s)]
*  Good. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3316.64s)]
*  And I don't hold — I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3318.08s)]
*  the fact that that war started. That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3325.68s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3331.04s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have their beautiful [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3334.3199999999997s)]
*  terraces — those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3337.8399999999997s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit by [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3342.7999999999997s)]
*  rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3348.7999999999997s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3351.44s)]
*  I think it's a war — I know it's a war. It didn't happen for four years. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3356.96s)]
*  It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3360.56s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3363.92s)]
*  But there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3367.28s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3370.64s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3378.0s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that — you can blame the man [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3380.64s)]
*  that was sitting in this seat, Biden. He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3388.2400000000002s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3392.32s)]
*  If I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3395.6s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3398.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3404.8799999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3413.92s)]
*  He's never said it. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3432.08s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3434.96s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3438.0s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. I don't even know what you're talking about. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3438.72s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3443.92s)]
*  No, no, wait. Wait. Next. Next. Next. Go. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3447.68s)]
*  How are you going to do that? And are you looking to do it to counter China? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3464.16s)]
*  Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3468.7999999999997s)]
*  What is the health of this journey? [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3474.16s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. Europe has gone through a lot of problems, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3476.16s)]
*  and a lot of it is having to do with immigration. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3480.16s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3483.2s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3488.16s)]
*  Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3491.6s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3494.96s)]
*  And I commented to her before. I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3501.52s)]
*  that subject, but they're not. Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3506.24s)]
*  the world. I want Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3512.8s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3518.4s)]
*  in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. Okay. At the beginning, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3524.56s)]
*  we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3528.88s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3534.96s)]
*  and transit, and to return people. The European Commission just did the new rules about [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3541.68s)]
*  repatriations and things like that. So things are changing. Thanks also to the example that [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3549.04s)]
*  Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. So they, we are working now together. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3555.04s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3563.52s)]
*  I would like to ask, I would like to ask, President Abouny, if you have discussed the option of starting [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3571.68s)]
*  here with Italy on satellite communications, and President Trump, if you want to see the Google [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3576.64s)]
*  company. The Google what? The Google company. What about the Google business? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3582.64s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. We've been discussing about defense space, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3592.0s)]
*  where we will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big, big things to do [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3599.28s)]
*  together, but we didn't discuss it. No, tariffs are making us rich. We were [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3606.7200000000003s)]
*  losing a lot of money under Biden, trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. And now that's, [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3624.1600000000003s)]
*  that whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of money. We're taking in a lot of money. Don't [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3632.48s)]
*  forget, we're taking in 25% on cars, 25% on steel, 25% on aluminum, 10% baseline. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3637.36s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3646.1600000000003s)]
*  25% for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3652.56s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. And [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3660.1600000000003s)]
*  we didn't do, we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3666.48s)]
*  to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China, where we took in up until this point, probably [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3670.6400000000003s)]
*  $700 billion. They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did everything he could. You [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3677.1200000000003s)]
*  know, he got paid money by China, right? The family got paid money. He did. And so I don't know, [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3683.1200000000003s)]
*  maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't, but he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3689.52s)]
*  because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. But [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3693.6800000000003s)]
*  I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3700.56s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. I took in more than $700 billion from China. So we're, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3708.4s)]
*  we're doing very well. I mean, our country is doing very well. They had a bad [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3715.68s)]
*  report today from one of the healthcare companies that had an impact on the stock market. But [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3720.32s)]
*  this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3726.7999999999997s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3731.84s)]
*  history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3736.16s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3740.64s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3742.8s)]
*  signed and when we're still working on the details for around eight or 20 seconds. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3756.96s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3762.1600000000003s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. We had an [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3766.2400000000002s)]
*  emergency of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an 80-day [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3773.52s)]
*  agreement and that's what will be signed. President Trump, on rate cuts, do you [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3779.6s)]
*  intend to see Powell's firing if he doesn't change his stand on rate cuts or is that on the table? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3787.76s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3794.96s)]
*  it puts us at a disadvantage here. I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3799.92s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. We don't have really inflation now. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3804.96s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3808.56s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3815.68s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline. And food is down. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3824.0s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3832.08s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3838.16s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3843.84s)]
*  But the costs are down. We have very little inflation. I would say we have essentially [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3847.92s)]
*  hard to have inflation when oil goes down. And oil goes down. When Biden came in, [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3853.2799999999997s)]
*  oil went through the roof. That's what caused our problem. That is very dumb spending. But [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3859.2s)]
*  when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3865.84s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. And that means that people driving cars are going [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3870.96s)]
*  to be paying $2 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. And even at the end, they tried just for the [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3875.92s)]
*  purpose of the election to get it down, but they had really lost that sucker. That was really, [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3884.48s)]
*  it was not good. But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3890.7200000000003s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. Could be even a little bit less than that. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3899.44s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3903.92s)]
*  come down quite a bit. And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3908.88s)]
*  interest rates down. That's the only thing he's good for. And he would have an effect on that if [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3916.48s)]
*  he lowered them. And I think at some point he will. He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3921.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, they are political also. And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3927.28s)]
*  lower interest rates. Okay? Yeah, go ahead. Please. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3932.88s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3946.8s)]
*  She's doing now, she's doing a great job. And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3952.8s)]
*  not just in Europe, anywhere. She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. And our relationship [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3958.16s)]
*  is great. And we have a lot of Italians in this country. I tell you. And they like Trump, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3965.8399999999997s)]
*  and they voted for Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3971.3599999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=3988.16s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4002.7999999999997s)]
*  Tallahassee, active shooting. I guess it's an active shooter. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4007.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm fully briefed as to where we are right now. It's a shame. It's a horrible thing. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4012.64s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. And we'll have more to say about it later. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4019.28s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4025.92s)]
*  who's doing a fantastic job. I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4032.24s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. And I can't say that about many people. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4040.16s)]
*  And she's become a friend. And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4045.6s)]
*  And we talked about trade. We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. And [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4053.6s)]
*  she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. And it's nice to have you with [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4061.36s)]
*  us. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you for your [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4065.36s)]
*  warm welcome. Thank you for this occasion. She's aimed to strengthen our relationship, [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4070.88s)]
*  our friendship that comes from Grifo. You know today is April 17th. And April 17 marks [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4076.32s)]
*  the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. And I say [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4083.36s)]
*  to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4091.12s)]
*  which is the fight against the war and ADI ideology that would like to erase our history. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4098.96s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4107.36s)]
*  synthetic drugs. You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4116.96s)]
*  for example. But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4123.04s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4132.16s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. I think [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4142.48s)]
*  there can be ways to work together. And the Italian enterprises will invest, as they've been [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4151.92s)]
*  doing for many years. As you know, in the next years, I think around 10 billion. That shows how [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4161.6s)]
*  interconnected our economies are. And that's very important, Mr. President. It's not only about [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4168.8s)]
*  Italy, it's about the entire Europe. The exchange between us is a very big one. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4174.64s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the trade. But at the end of the [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4184.160000000001s)]
*  day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. I don't know [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4191.76s)]
*  if it is the right word, but I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4197.04s)]
*  such a graphical space. I speak about the civilization. And I want to make that civilization [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4202.8s)]
*  stronger. So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4208.56s)]
*  time that we try to sit down and find solutions. So I want to thank President Trump for having [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4216.16s)]
*  accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider the [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4224.08s)]
*  possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. The goal for me is to make the West great [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4229.84s)]
*  again. And I think we can do it together. And we will keep on working on that. I'm going to close. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4237.12s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4246.16s)]
*  as very good as a very good situation, despite the difficulties of stable country, [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4251.92s)]
*  really reliable country, one million more jobs in the last two years and a half. Great inflation [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4258.4800000000005s)]
*  is going down. So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4266.0s)]
*  you understand me. So migration flows going down 60%. So we are trying to do our best, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4272.08s)]
*  but I think we can do it even better together. Also in Ukraine, I will close together. We've [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4278.64s)]
*  been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. We can build a just and lasting peace. We [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4283.6s)]
*  support your efforts. Good. Thank you very much. And I think we're doing well in that effort, [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4287.92s)]
*  but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. We want to save on average. Think of it every [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4293.76s)]
*  week. 2500 people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. And if we can [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4299.84s)]
*  save those lives, that would be a very good thing. And so we'll see what we can do. And I [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4306.72s)]
*  think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. And you've been very helpful. I [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4310.96s)]
*  appreciate it. Thank you. Any questions? How much longer does Wagner have to respond to your [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4315.360000000001s)]
*  ceasefire proposal before you put secondary terrorists or stations on Russia? We'll see what [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4325.92s)]
*  that will be. We're going to be hearing from them this week. Very shortly, actually, and we'll see. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4332.4s)]
*  But we wanted to stop. We want the death and the killing to stop. You said that the termination of [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4340.48s)]
*  Rome, how did not come fast enough? He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. Oh, he'll leave. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4348.96s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4354.639999999999s)]
*  he's doing the job. He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4360.08s)]
*  I let him know it. And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. Believe me. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4368.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please. Question. Are you trying to remove him as a president? Yeah, question. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4375.2s)]
*  Question. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4381.12s)]
*  Mr. President, would you hesitate to oppose for a case against your administration? [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4382.16s)]
*  So the Constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience of judicial order. Do you agree with that statement? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4387.2s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. We have great lawyers. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4392.72s)]
*  I can tell you this. We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4396.32s)]
*  Biden allowed into the country. Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4401.28s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. A lot of [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4408.72s)]
*  reasons. The economy, a lot of things. But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4414.32s)]
*  I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4420.0s)]
*  open borders. I'm going to get them out. And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4424.56s)]
*  As you know, we want everything. The popular vote, all seven swing states. We want everything. And [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4431.84s)]
*  that's what the public wanted. That's what I'm doing. But you'll have to speak to the lawyers [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4438.24s)]
*  because it's up to them. Mr. President, what do you think of the proposal from France and the UK [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4442.4s)]
*  of a peace mission in Ukraine with soldiers? And do you think that Italy should make a decision? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4448.96s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. But [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4456.32s)]
*  peace missions are always good with me. I'm okay with peace missions. Yeah, please. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4459.52s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what your operation is? [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4463.2s)]
*  The Prime Minister said Italy has the best space in Europe. [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4467.92s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4473.28s)]
*  countries. And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. We have a lot of [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4478.0s)]
*  countries that want to make a deal. Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4485.28s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. Would you say something? We've been across the city. We're working on the big [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4489.2s)]
*  15 economies. We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. I believe it's been called with [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4494.96s)]
*  the EU already. And then we have a South Korea coming in next week. And I believe India is also [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4501.92s)]
*  talking. That's moving very quickly. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4509.76s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4515.76s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have any evidence that China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4516.16s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? And also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4523.68s)]
*  Is that true? Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4528.5599999999995s)]
*  next Thursday. Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4532.96s)]
*  we have a deal on that. No, I have no comment on that. I have no idea. That's his statement, not mine. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4539.6s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4555.36s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities? [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4557.36s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4562.32s)]
*  have a great country and to live happily without death. And I'd like to see that. That's my first [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4567.76s)]
*  option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. And I think Iran is [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4574.96s)]
*  wanting to talk. I hope they're wanting to talk. It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4584.16s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future. It'd do fantastically well. I know the Iranian [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4589.68s)]
*  people. They're incredible people. Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4596.56s)]
*  people. And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. I really don't. But Iran [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4601.92s)]
*  can't have a nuclear weapon. It's pretty simple. It's really simple. We're not looking to take [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4609.4400000000005s)]
*  their industry. We're not looking to take their land. We're not always saying, you can't have a [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4615.84s)]
*  nuclear weapon. The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4621.52s)]
*  expired already. It was a terrible deal. It would have expired. And that gave them a clear path to [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4628.0s)]
*  a nuclear weapon. I wouldn't have accepted it. That's why I terminated the deal. Number one, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4634.72s)]
*  it was way too short. You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4638.72s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. And I terminated that. And it was a great termination [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4644.320000000001s)]
*  because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated. You know what the deal was. It was [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4651.2s)]
*  a terrible deal. Really. One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. But no, I want, I'd like to see [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4655.36s)]
*  Iran thrive. And they can do that, I think, very easily. Or they can do it the other way. The other [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4663.5199999999995s)]
*  way is not going to be good for them. It's going to be really bad for them. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4670.96s)]
*  The Press. Mr. President, will you take steps to return Kilmar of Arrego Garcia to the United States [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4673.92s)]
*  in front of a judge? [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4702.32s)]
*  The President. Well, I'm not involved in it. I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4703.12s)]
*  to the lawyers, the DOJ. I've heard many things about him. And we'll have to find out what the [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4708.16s)]
*  truth is. But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4716.72s)]
*  people during the Biden administration. They say 21 million. And a big percentage of those are [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4724.8s)]
*  serious criminals. I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4732.4800000000005s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level. Murderers. Many of those people murdered more [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4737.28s)]
*  than one person. And they're on the loose. And I was elected to get rid of those criminals to get [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4742.88s)]
*  them out of our country. Or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. And I don't see how [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4749.12s)]
*  judges can take that authority away from a President. We've done an amazing job. Tom Hulman, [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4755.360000000001s)]
*  Kristi Noem. We have done an amazing job. Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4761.4400000000005s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. We have [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4766.64s)]
*  right now 99 percent border. It's a 99 percent. Nobody thought that would even be, but nobody's [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4771.12s)]
*  coming through our border practically. Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4776.400000000001s)]
*  medical reasons. We allowed them. We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4781.92s)]
*  something else. All for medical reasons. We have a great border. We had a great border four years ago, [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4786.8s)]
*  but we have a border now that's even tighter. And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4794.16s)]
*  And now we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  were in jail for horrible. You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world and [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4807.04s)]
*  released them, not just South America, all over the world. The Congo and Africa. Many, many people [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4813.84s)]
*  come from the Congo. I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo and all over the world. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4819.84s)]
*  They came in, opened their jails, Venezuela, practically all of their prisoners released into [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4825.52s)]
*  our country. We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4831.12s)]
*  administration. And to think what they've done to our country. And I was elected to straighten that [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4836.400000000001s)]
*  out and I'm doing that. But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4843.6s)]
*  country. They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4851.360000000001s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. I don't know. Maybe that's the liberal way or as [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4857.52s)]
*  they call it nowadays, the progressive way. But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4862.4800000000005s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4867.84s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals will be done, but you also said that you're in no rush. Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. How long can they expect that pain to last? [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4873.68s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4885.68s)]
*  You have gasoline that hit a dollar and 98 yesterday in a couple of states. You have [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4894.400000000001s)]
*  gasoline's way down. The price of oil has dropped substantially. The price of groceries are substantially down. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4900.8s)]
*  The price of eggs. You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. I just got there. I was here for one [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4908.96s)]
*  week and they started screaming at me, eggs have gone through the roof. I said, I just got here. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4916.16s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4920.96s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4926.320000000001s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. I said, I've only been here. I just, this is my seventh day. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4930.400000000001s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. They said you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. Happy Easter, everybody. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4938.08s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. And we did an unbelievable job and now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4945.92s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. They've really done a fantastic job. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4953.5199999999995s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4962.48s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of actually, but he's playing politics. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4972.48s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down in Europe. As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4978.0s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. But our guy wants to play cute. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4985.679999999999s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4991.2s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve because they're not very smart people. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=4997.839999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir, please. Go ahead, please. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5002.639999999999s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5013.04s)]
*  Stock market went up 88 points. I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5017.679999999999s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5028.4800000000005s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5035.84s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real president. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5041.92s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. We had presidents that in some cases were smart, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5049.4400000000005s)]
*  but they didn't understand business or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5057.52s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration. The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5063.120000000001s)]
*  That's about all they could do. They couldn't do anything that were useless. They were incompetent. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5067.4400000000005s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. Worst than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5071.040000000001s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. Joe Biden was. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5077.76s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers where this all happens. It's happening now. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5083.4400000000005s)]
*  I mean everybody wants to make a deal and if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5089.52s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. We're just saying this is what it is. But we want to listen to everybody. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5094.0s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5099.68s)]
*  we're going to be very fair to people. But you know we're the one that really sets the deal and that's what we'll be doing. [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5111.44s)]
*  Go ahead please. Please. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5119.679999999999s)]
*  Oh you have a great prime minister. You're so lucky. Yes. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5125.12s)]
*  Oh yes. That's okay. I'm not sure that. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5128.959999999999s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... That was so beautiful. What the hell was that? What did he say? Please. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5200.48s)]
*  No I mean it sounded great. It was beautifully presented. But maybe I could hear what she said. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5217.839999999999s)]
*  It was about asking... [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5226.320000000001s)]
*  Hold it. Hold it. Have some respect please. Thank you. No no wait. I want to hear what she said. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5230.4800000000005s)]
*  Go ahead please. President, Prime Minister Maloney was asked whether what she thinks about the fact [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5238.8s)]
*  that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine. And Prime Minister Maloney [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5244.64s)]
*  answered well actually we have... No and also if you talked about the military [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5253.84s)]
*  spending and the raising of the military spending and the fact and the first thing [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5265.28s)]
*  President Prime Minister Maloney said is that no actually we didn't talk about the raise of [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5270.96s)]
*  military spending. Of course Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent and then we will see [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5276.32s)]
*  because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... Well I will do that. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5282.32s)]
*  They've been asking if we raise if we decided another percentage about the defense spending [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5290.719999999999s)]
*  and I said yes NATO and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5297.759999999999s)]
*  decided. We didn't speak about the specific other percentage but we are aware of the fact that [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5304.96s)]
*  defense is important for the future and we see what also the the war that we are trying to do [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5311.28s)]
*  at the European left. And I don't hold I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5317.679999999999s)]
*  thrilled with the fact that that war started. That was a war that would have never started [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5326.88s)]
*  if I were president. You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. You'd have cities [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5331.84s)]
*  that would be open and thriving and then have their beautiful terraces. Those terraces are the [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5336.96s)]
*  most beautiful in the world but they're not with us any longer. They're smashed to smithereens laying [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5341.2s)]
*  on the ground in a million pieces getting hit by rockets bombs and bullets and so I'm not happy with [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5347.6s)]
*  him and I'm not happy with anybody involved. I think it's a war. I know it's a war. It didn't [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5355.52s)]
*  happen for four years. It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5361.44s)]
*  and I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye but there's no way he [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5365.76s)]
*  would have ever gone in if I were president. Now I'm trying to get him to stop because as you know [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5370.0s)]
*  Russia's a lot bigger. It's a bigger military force and if you're smart you don't go involved [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5377.36s)]
*  and get involved in wars that you can blame the man that was sitting in this seat Biden. He didn't [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5386.08s)]
*  know what the hell was going on but I can guarantee you that and everybody agrees to it if I were [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5392.64s)]
*  president that war would have never taken place. I'm not blaming him but what I am saying is that [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5397.92s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job okay. I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5404.240000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5410.08s)]
*  Are you sure about the definition of the [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5427.04s)]
*  the [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5429.52s)]
*  European. Have you said that the Europeans are parasites? Yeah. Have you seen it? No I haven't [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5436.080000000001s)]
*  said I don't know. I don't even know what you're talking about. Go ahead please. Go ahead. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5441.52s)]
*  No no wait wait next next next go. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5449.52s)]
*  Together sure. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5459.68s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. Europe has gone through a lot of problems and a [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5477.92s)]
*  lot of it's having to do with immigration and I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5482.320000000001s)]
*  with immigration at all and I think they got to get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5487.76s)]
*  by what they've done with immigration. Now I'll say this that the prime minister has taken a very [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5495.04s)]
*  tough stand on immigration and I commented to her before I said I wish more people would be like you [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5499.92s)]
*  having to do with that subject but they're not. Europe is very important to me. Europe is very [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5507.360000000001s)]
*  important to the world. I want Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5514.16s)]
*  immigration. But we are beginning to do it. You've seen you've all seen how the policies of [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5519.12s)]
*  the European Union in the last let's say two and a half years have been changing. Okay at the beginning [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5525.5199999999995s)]
*  we were talking all only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. Now [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5530.8s)]
*  we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5537.44s)]
*  transit and to return people. The European Commission just did the new rules about [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5543.76s)]
*  repatriations and things like that. So things are changing thanks also to the example that [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5550.88s)]
*  Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. So they we are working now together. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5556.96s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5565.36s)]
*  The Google what? [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5586.799999999999s)]
*  The Google business. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5587.52s)]
*  Oh well we didn't discuss about Starlink. We've been discussing about defense space. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5593.84s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big big things to do together but we [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5602.0s)]
*  didn't discuss it. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5609.280000000001s)]
*  No. No tariffs are making us rich. We were [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5617.52s)]
*  losing a lot of money under Biden. Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. And now that's that [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5627.200000000001s)]
*  whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of money. We're taking in a lot of money. Don't forget we're [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5634.56s)]
*  taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5639.68s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5648.0s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5654.400000000001s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5662.0s)]
*  talk to you. And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5666.160000000001s)]
*  put on previous to Biden which were the tariffs that put on China where we took in up until this [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5671.68s)]
*  point probably 700 billion dollars. They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5677.280000000001s)]
*  everything he could. You know he got paid money by China right? The family got paid money. He did. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5684.0s)]
*  And so I don't know maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't but he tried to weaken them but [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5689.52s)]
*  he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets you know they couldn't stand [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5695.2s)]
*  not doing it. But I took in in the up till this point my tariffs on China. Nobody ever took in [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5699.92s)]
*  ten cents from China. No other president took in ten cents. I took in more than 700 billion dollars [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5709.04s)]
*  from China. So we're we're doing very well. I mean our country is doing very well. They had a bad [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5714.8s)]
*  report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market but [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5722.24s)]
*  this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5728.639999999999s)]
*  and again I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far. History of any [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5733.679999999999s)]
*  country probably but the history of our country in four years and I think this has a chance to be [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5738.719999999999s)]
*  much better. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5744.08s)]
*  The White House with Ukraine on Thursday. Will the president be coming here for that? [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5751.28s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be signed [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5755.12s)]
*  and when? We're still working on the details. We're shooting for around April 20th. Is there [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5759.12s)]
*  any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5764.24s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously but the president was here. We had a numbering [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5768.5599999999995s)]
*  of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and I think it's an 80-page agreement and [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5775.76s)]
*  that's what we'll be signing. President Trump, on rate cuts, do you intend to see Powell's firing [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5782.08s)]
*  if he doesn't change his ban on rate cuts or is that on the table? Well I think he should do the [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5792.08s)]
*  rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. I mean [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5798.0s)]
*  he plays right into their hands. So I think he should do the rate cuts. We don't have really [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5804.4s)]
*  inflation now. I just said the major things are going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5809.2s)]
*  schedule and that's because of our policies. But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5816.48s)]
*  and I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline and food is down, [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5825.92s)]
*  groceries as we call it are down. Other than interest rates, everything's down. Interest rates [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5833.92s)]
*  are pretty flat. It's not that they're up but we should be better than flat. If he would lower [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5840.719999999999s)]
*  the interest rate I think would have a good impact on that too. The costs are down. We have very little [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5846.5599999999995s)]
*  inflation. I would say we have essentially no inflation. Hard to have inflation when oil goes [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5852.719999999999s)]
*  down and oil goes down. When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. That's what caused our [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5856.88s)]
*  problem. That and his very dumb spending. But when the oil prices go down and they have gone down a [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5863.12s)]
*  lot, we've gotten it down really good. We've opened it up and we've gotten them down and that [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5870.24s)]
*  means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 instead of $4.50 and [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5875.68s)]
*  you know even at the end they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5883.5199999999995s)]
*  but they had really lost that sucker. That was really, it was not good but if they had won, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5888.72s)]
*  oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy and we're going to be at about $2. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5896.48s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that and you're starting to see it. So I don't know how [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5903.92s)]
*  you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit and I would say the Fed really owes [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5908.32s)]
*  it to the American people to get interest rates down. That's the only thing he's good for [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5916.8s)]
*  and he would have an effect on that if he lowered them and I think at some point he will. He's going [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5921.360000000001s)]
*  to have a lot of political pressure. You know they are political also and I think there's a [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=5927.76s)]

*  time that we try to sit down and find solutions so I want to thank President Trump for having [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6218.0s)]

*  I would say maybe that was the number one factor a lot of reasons the economy a lot of things but [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6413.76s)]
*  one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said I'm going to get the criminals that he [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6418.400000000001s)]

*  Well I think Italy will have to make that determination but [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6456.88s)]

*  next Thursday soon and I assume they're going to live up to the deal so we'll see but [[01:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6534.72s)]

*  Then you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities? [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6558.8s)]
*  to talk it's going to be very good for them if they do and I'd like to see Iran be [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6588.96s)]
*  thrive in the future do fantastically well I know the Iranian people they're incredible people [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6593.6s)]

*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon it's you know pretty simple it's really simple [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6610.8s)]
*  we're not looking to take their industry we're not looking to take their land we're not all [[01:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6615.84s)]
*  we're saying is we you can't have a nuclear weapon the deal that was made the deal that was [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6621.84s)]
*  made with Obama and that deal would have expired already it was a terrible deal it was it would have [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6627.36s)]
*  expired and that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon I wouldn't have accepted that's [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6633.04s)]
*  why I terminated the deal number one it was way too short you know when countries are involved [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6638.88s)]
*  you don't make short-term deals these are countries with long lives and I terminated that [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6644.08s)]
*  and it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated you [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6651.5199999999995s)]

*  thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6966.08s)]
*  is playing politics as somebody that i've never been very fond of actually but uh he's playing [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6971.92s)]

*  and again but our guy wants to play cute but uh interest rates are pretty much even maybe they [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6989.68s)]
*  went up just a slight bit but that's the only thing but that's because of the federal reserve [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=6997.68s)]
*  because they're not very smart people [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7002.4800000000005s)]

*  this time because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical we're taking [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7032.08s)]
*  in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs we were treated very unfairly on trade and [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7038.16s)]
*  the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7044.88s)]
*  anymore because we have a real president we have a president that understands what it's all about [[01:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7048.88s)]
*  we had presidents that in some cases were smart but they didn't understand business or they didn't [[01:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7055.04s)]
*  like business or you know it wasn't like a priority and then you had like the last [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7061.5199999999995s)]

*  don't want to make a deal we'll make the deal for them because that's what's going to happen we're [[01:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7093.5199999999995s)]
*  just saying this is what it is but we want to listen to everybody and i i think i think i think [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7097.92s)]
*  i guess i think i can say for scott and the other people that are working on it [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7105.36s)]
*  that uh we're listening and uh we're going to be very fair to people but you know we're the one [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7110.5599999999995s)]
*  that really sets the deal and that's what we'll be doing okay [[01:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7116.16s)]
*  oh you have a great prime minister you're so lucky yes yes yes okay i'm not sure they do agree [[01:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7126.96s)]
*  yes [[01:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7136.2s)]
*  foreign [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7160.32s)]
*  We are a serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this percentage will increase, [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7165.36s)]
*  even if we are aware that the issue of defense is a particularly important issue at this time. [[01:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7171.36s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, I think there was an invasion, [[01:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7176.36s)]
*  and the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, [[01:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7184.36s)]
*  but that's not what reveals today that we want to work together, [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7189.36s)]
*  and we are working to try to bring peace to Ukraine, which can be just and lasting. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7195.36s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we are making to share our work, [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7200.36s)]
*  and we have also shared our voice today. [[02:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7205.36s)]
*  No, I mean it sounded great. It was beautifully presented, [[02:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7219.36s)]
*  but maybe I could hear what she said. [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7224.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7228.36s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7230.36s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. I want to hear what she said. [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7233.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7239.36s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Maloney was asked what she thinks about the fact that [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7241.36s)]
*  President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, [[02:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7246.36s)]
*  and Prime Minister Maloney answered, well, actually, we have... [[02:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7253.36s)]
*  No, and also, you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7261.36s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that, no, actually, [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7270.36s)]
*  we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7275.36s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7278.36s)]
*  and then we will see because we are absolutely aware of the fact that [[02:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7283.36s)]
*  it is very important to... [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7286.36s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7289.36s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7290.36s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I will do that. [[02:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7291.36s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided on a defense percentage about the defense spending, [[02:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7292.36s)]
*  and I said, yes, NATO, and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7299.36s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7307.36s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7311.36s)]
*  and we see also the work that we are trying to do at the European level. [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7316.36s)]
*  And I don't hold... I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7321.36s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[02:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7325.36s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7330.36s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7334.36s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7337.36s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[02:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7341.36s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7346.36s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7351.36s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7354.36s)]
*  I think it's a war. I know it's a war. It didn't happen for four years. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7360.36s)]
*  It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[02:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7364.36s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye, [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7367.36s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7371.36s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[02:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7374.36s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7381.36s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars. [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7384.36s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7390.36s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7394.36s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7396.36s)]
*  if I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7399.36s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7402.36s)]
*  Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7408.36s)]

*  The Press. Are you sure about the definition of a parasite for Europeans? [[02:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7421.36s)]

*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7486.36s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[02:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7491.36s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7498.36s)]
*  And I commented to her before. I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7504.36s)]
*  But they're not. Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7510.36s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7516.36s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7521.36s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7523.36s)]
*  Okay. At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7531.36s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7538.36s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7547.36s)]
*  So things are changing, thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7554.36s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. So I'm optimistic on that. [[02:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7563.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7568.36s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romney, you have discussed the option of a study here with Italy on civil rights and immigration. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7572.36s)]
*  And President Trump, if you want to see the Google company... [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7582.36s)]
*  The Google what? [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7587.36s)]
*  The Google company. [[02:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7589.36s)]
*  What about it? [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7590.36s)]
*  The Google business. [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7591.36s)]
*  If you want to see it, now. [[02:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7592.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7594.36s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. We've been discussing about defense space. [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7595.36s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7602.36s)]
*  I think that maybe your brother is a big deal for the Prime Minister that changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you plan to do going forward. [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7612.36s)]
*  No. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7622.36s)]
*  I think the Prime Minister said to you that changed your perspective. [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7623.36s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. We were losing a lot of money under Biden. Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[02:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7625.36s)]
*  And now that's, that whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of money. We're taking in a lot of money. [[02:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7634.36s)]
*  Don't forget we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7640.36s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada. [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7648.36s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[02:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7655.36s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[02:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7662.36s)]
*  And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7668.36s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did everything he could. You know, he got paid money by China, right? Family got paid money. He did. [[02:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7681.36s)]
*  And so I don't know. Maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[02:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7691.36s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China. Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. No other president took in 10 cents. I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. [[02:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7703.36s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. I mean, our country is doing very well. They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[02:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7717.36s)]
*  But this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other. [[02:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7729.36s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, the history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7735.36s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7744.36s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be signed and when? [[02:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7756.36s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7765.36s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. We had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an 80 take agreement. [[02:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7769.36s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[02:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7783.36s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage here. [[02:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7784.36s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. So I think he should do the rate cuts. We don't have really inflation now. [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7804.36s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of schedule. And that's because of our policies. [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7811.36s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. And I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7820.36s)]
*  And food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down. Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[02:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7831.36s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. If he would lower the interest rate, I think would have a good impact on that too. [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7841.36s)]
*  But the costs are down. We have very little inflation. I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[02:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7851.36s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. That's what caused our problem. [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7856.36s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7865.36s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.00 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7874.36s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. But they had really lost that sucker. [[02:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7884.36s)]
*  That was really it was not good. But if they had won oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7893.36s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2.00, could be even a little bit less than that. And you're starting to see it. [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7903.36s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has has come down quite a bit. [[02:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7909.36s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. That's the only thing he's good for. [[02:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7915.36s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he if he if he lowered him. And I think at some point he will. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7923.36s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. You know, they are political also. [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7929.36s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7934.36s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Please. [[02:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7938.36s)]
*  Only if the prime minister remains the prime minister can it be our best. [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7950.36s)]
*  She's she's doing now she's doing a great job. And yeah, it's certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe. [[02:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7955.36s)]
*  Anyway, she's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7963.36s)]
*  And our relationship is is great. And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7967.36s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7973.36s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[02:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=7993.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee. [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8006.36s)]
*  Active shooting, I guess it's an active shooter. Fully briefed as to where we are right now. It's a shame. [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8013.36s)]
*  It's a horrible thing, horrible that things like this take place. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8021.36s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8025.36s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the prime minister of Italy with us. [[02:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8029.36s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8034.36s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8038.36s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. And I can't say that about many people. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8043.36s)]
*  And she's become a friend. And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[02:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8048.36s)]
*  And we talked about trade. We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8056.36s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. And it's nice to have you with us. Thank you very much. [[02:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8062.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you for your warm welcome. [[02:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8070.36s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship that comes from very far. [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8075.36s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8082.36s)]
*  And I say to remember our ancient ties, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[02:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8093.36s)]
*  which is the fight against the war and the ideology that we like to erase our history. [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8102.36s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[02:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8110.36s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8121.36s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8127.36s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[02:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8144.36s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together and the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[02:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8155.36s)]
*  And I know in the next years, I think around 10 billions, that shows how interconnected our economies are. [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8167.36s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8175.36s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. Investments, trade. It's a topic that we are discussing in the trade. [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8181.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[02:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8194.36s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about such a graphical space. [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8200.36s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8207.36s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[02:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8212.36s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future. [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8223.36s)]
*  And consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8231.36s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. And I think we can do it together. [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8237.36s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. I'm going to close. [[02:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8243.36s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has a very good situation despite the difficulties. [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8249.36s)]
*  A stable country, a reliable country. One million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8260.36s)]
*  Inflation is going down. So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[02:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8267.36s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8276.36s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close together. We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. [[02:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8284.36s)]
*  We can build a just and lasting peace. We support your efforts. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8288.36s)]
*  Good. Thank you very much. And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8292.36s)]
*  We want to save on average. Think of it every week. Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[02:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8300.36s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[02:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8308.36s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8312.36s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Any questions? [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8317.36s)]
*  How much longer does Wagner have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before you put secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[02:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8321.36s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. We're going to be hearing from them this week. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8335.36s)]
*  Very shortly, actually, and we'll see. But we want it to stop. We want the death and the killing to stop. [[02:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8341.36s)]
*  On Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell cannot come fast enough. He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[02:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8349.36s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8357.36s)]
*  He's too late. Always too late. A little slow. And I'm not happy with him. [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8365.36s)]
*  Let him know it. And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. Believe me. [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8372.36s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, please. Question. Yeah. Question. [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8378.36s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. We have great lawyers. [[02:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8386.36s)]
*  I can tell you this. We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into the country. [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8399.36s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8406.36s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. A lot of reasons. [[02:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8412.36s)]
*  The economy, a lot of things. But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[02:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8418.36s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. As you know, we want everything. [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8429.36s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. We want everything. And that's what the public wanted. [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8436.36s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. But you have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8442.36s)]
*  Say it. [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8449.36s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. But peace missions are always good with me. I'm OK with peace missions. Yeah, please. [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8459.36s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think with all countries. [[02:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8476.36s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8482.36s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. Go ahead, Scott. Would you say something? [[02:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8490.36s)]
*  Also talking that's moving very quickly. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8512.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8519.36s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, next Thursday. [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8532.36s)]
*  Soon. And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that. [[02:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8537.36s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. I have no idea. That's his statement, not mine. [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8545.36s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8559.36s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death. [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8565.36s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. That's my first option. If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[02:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8576.36s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. I hope they're wanting to talk. It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[02:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8585.36s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[02:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8593.36s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people, always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[02:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8599.36s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. I really don't. [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8606.36s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. It's pretty simple. It's really simple. [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8612.36s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. We're not looking to take their land. All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8617.36s)]
*  The deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have expired already. It was a terrible deal. It would have expired. [[02:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8626.36s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. I wouldn't have accepted it. That's why I terminated the deal. [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8636.36s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. These are countries with long lives. [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8641.36s)]
*  And I terminated that. And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated. [[02:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8650.36s)]
*  You know what the deal was. It was a terrible deal. Really. One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8657.36s)]
*  But no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. And they can do that, I think, very easily. Or they can do it the other way. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8664.36s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. It's going to be really bad for them. [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8674.36s)]
*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy. He's become a friend of mine. And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8685.36s)]
*  He loves our country. I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8693.36s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[02:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8707.36s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8713.36s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[02:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8720.36s)]
*  They say 21 million. And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[02:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8729.36s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8736.36s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[02:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8740.36s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[02:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8744.36s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[02:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8749.36s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8757.36s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. Tom Holman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8761.36s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. Far greater than what I said. [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8767.36s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8771.36s)]
*  We have right now 99 percent border. It's a 99 percent. [[02:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8773.36s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, nobody's coming through our border practically. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8777.36s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[02:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8781.36s)]
*  We allowed them, we brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[02:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8785.36s)]
*  All for medical reasons. We have a great border. [[02:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8790.36s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8794.36s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8799.36s)]
*  And now we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that were in jail for horrible. [[02:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8802.36s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world. [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8811.36s)]
*  All over the world and we listen, not just South America, all over the world, the Congo and Africa. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8816.36s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8822.36s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails, Venezuela. [[02:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8827.36s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[02:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8832.36s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration. [[02:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8835.36s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[02:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8841.36s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. And I'm doing that. [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8845.36s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8849.36s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8855.36s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. I don't know. [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8861.36s)]
*  Maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[02:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8863.36s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8868.36s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think that the President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done. [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8873.36s)]
*  But you also said that you're in no rush. Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8880.36s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8885.36s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better. [[02:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8889.36s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, you have gasoline that hit. [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8892.36s)]
*  And, Dallin, 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[02:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8900.36s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. The price of groceries are substantially down. [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8905.36s)]
*  The price of eggs. You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. I just got there. [[02:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8912.36s)]
*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me, eggs have gone through the roof. [[02:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8918.36s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8922.36s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8929.36s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. I said, I've only been here. I just, this is my seventh day. [[02:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8933.36s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[02:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8940.36s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8944.36s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8950.36s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[02:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8957.36s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. So prices haven't gone up. [[02:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8964.36s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[02:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8967.36s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of actually. But he's playing politics. [[02:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8974.36s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down in Europe. [[02:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8980.36s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[02:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8985.36s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. But our guy wants to play cute. [[02:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8989.36s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[02:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=8994.36s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9001.36s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir. Please. Go ahead. Please. [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9006.36s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9012.36s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[02:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9021.36s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[02:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9032.36s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[02:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9039.36s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real president. [[02:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9045.36s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9053.36s)]
*  The presidents that in some cases were smart, but they didn't understand business or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9057.36s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration. The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[02:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9066.36s)]
*  That's about all they could do. They couldn't do anything that were useless. They were incompetent. [[02:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9071.36s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[02:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9074.36s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. [[02:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9078.36s)]
*  And I think that's what Joe Biden was. So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[02:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9085.36s)]
*  It's happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them because that's what's going to happen. [[02:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9092.36s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. But we want to listen to everybody. [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9099.36s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[02:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9103.36s)]
*  But, you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. That's what we'll be doing. [[02:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9116.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9120.36s)]
*  I have a question to our Prime Minister. [[02:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9125.36s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. You're so lucky. Yes. [[02:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9128.36s)]
*  In Italian? [[02:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9131.36s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[02:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9132.36s)]
*  I'm not sure that it will be. [[02:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9133.36s)]
*  Presidente Meloni, lo so bene. Cosa pensate del fatto che Presidente Trump ha considerato responsabile Zaleschi della guerra con Crayna? E poi se avete parlato delle spese in Italia, qual è il limite massimo a cui ha detto che può arrivare l'Italia? [[02:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9135.36s)]
*  No, non abbiamo parlato del limite massimo a cui può arrivare l'Italia. Abbiamo parlato del fatto che l'Italia sta mantenendo i suoi impegni perché arriverà al prossimo vertice della NATO, rappresentato con il 2%, che era già previsto, che è stato sottoscritto dai governi precedenti, perché siamo una nazione seria, ma non abbiamo parlato poi di quanto vada aumentata questa percentuale, anche se siamo consapevoli che il tema della difesa sia un tema particolarmente importante di questo tempo. [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9151.36s)]
*  Per quello che riguarda la guerra in Ucraina, lei sa come la penso, penso che ci sia chiaramente una, diciamo ci sia stata un'invasione e che l'invasore da quel punto di vista fosse Putin e la Russia, ma non è questo che, diciamo, oggi quello che rivela è il fatto che insieme vogliamo lavorare, stiamo lavorando per cercare di arrivare in Ucraina una pace che possa essere giusta e duratura. [[02:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9178.36s)]
*  Penso che questi siano gli sforzi sui quali condividiamo il nostro lavoro, abbiamo condiviso anche oggi il nostro lavoro. [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9202.36s)]
*  Presidente, Prime Minister Malone was asked what she thinks about the fact that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine and Prime Minister Malone answered, well, actually, we were, [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9232.36s)]
*  we have, no, and also if you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending, and the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is that no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending, of course Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent and then we will see because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to [[02:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9261.36s)]
*  Well, I will do that. I've been asking if we decided another percentage about the defense spending and I said, yes, NATO, and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided, we didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9291.36s)]
*  and we see also the war that we are trying to do with the European left. [[02:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9318.36s)]
*  And I don't hold, I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. That was a war that would have never started if I were president. You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[02:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9322.36s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving and they'd have their beautiful terraces. Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit by rockets, bombs and bullets. [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9339.36s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him and I'm not happy with anybody involved. I think it's a war. I know it's a war. It didn't happen for four years. It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[02:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9356.36s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye, but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. Now I'm trying to get him to stop because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. It's a bigger military force. [[02:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9368.36s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that you can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. He didn't know what the hell was going on. But I can guarantee you that, and everybody agrees to it, if I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9385.36s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[02:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9403.36s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. [[02:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9419.36s)]
*  The European. Have you said that Europeans are parasites? Have you seen it? No, I haven't said. I don't know what you're talking about. Go ahead. Please. Go ahead. No, no, wait, wait. Next. Next. Next. Go. [[02:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9433.36s)]
*  Sure. [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9463.36s)]
*  That's what you said. [[02:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9466.36s)]
*  How are you going to do that? And are you looking to do it to counter China? Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9469.36s)]
*  I think we have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[02:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9499.36s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. Okay. At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[02:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9523.36s)]
*  So the European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. So things are changing. Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. So they we are working now together. So I'm optimistic on that. [[02:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9549.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9570.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9573.36s)]
*  The Google what? [[02:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9576.36s)]
*  What about it? [[02:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9579.36s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[02:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9582.36s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about about the Starling. [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9585.36s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space where we will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[02:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9588.36s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. We were losing a lot of money under Biden. Trafficking, we were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9603.36s)]
*  We're discussing. [[02:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9613.36s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. We were losing a lot of money under Biden. Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. And now that's that whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of money. We're taking in a lot of money. [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9627.36s)]
*  We're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9643.36s)]
*  No, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up to this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[02:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9665.36s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did everything he could. You know, he got paid money by China, right? The family got paid money. He did. And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because it was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[02:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9683.36s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China, nor the president took in 10 cents. I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. So we're we're doing very well. I mean, our country is doing very well. [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9705.36s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. But this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other. And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[02:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9724.36s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be signed and what? [[02:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9754.36s)]
*  The heat is taking brainless and that's what we'll be signing. [[02:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9784.36s)]
*  Can you clarify on rate cuts? Do you intend to see how firing if he doesn't change his stance on rate cuts or is that on the table? [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9791.36s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage here. I mean, he plays right into their hands. So I think he should do the rate cuts. We don't have really inflation now. I just said the major things are going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of schedule. And that's because of our policies. But oil is down into the 60 dollar, 65 dollar range now per barrel. [[02:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9799.36s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than two dollars for gasoline and food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down. Other than interest rates, everything's down. Interest rates are pretty flat. It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. If he would lower the interest rate, I think would have a good impact on that too. [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9829.36s)]
*  But the costs are down. We have very little inflation. I would say we have essentially no inflation. Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. When when Biden came in, oil went through the roof. That's what caused our problem. That and is very dumb spending. [[02:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9853.36s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying two dollars and two dollars and 50 cents instead of four dollars and 50 cents. [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9869.36s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. But they had really lost that sucker. That was really, it was not good. But if they had one oil right now would be at seven or eight dollars because of their policy. [[02:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9886.36s)]
*  And we're going to be at about two dollars could be even a little bit less than that. And you're starting to see it. So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil is has come down quite a bit. And and I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[02:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9904.36s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. And he would have an effect on that if he if he if he lowered him. And I think at some point he will. He's going to have a lot of political pressure. You know, they are political also. And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[02:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9922.36s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Please. Only if the prime minister remains the prime minister can it be our best. She's doing now she's doing a great job. And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[02:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9939.36s)]
*  And our relationship is is great. And we have a lot of Italians in this country. I tell you, and they like Trump and they voted for Trump. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [[02:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9967.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee. Active shooting, I guess it's an active shooter. Fully briefed as to where we are right now. It's a shame. It's a horrible thing. [[02:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=9997.36s)]
*  Horrible than things like this take place. And we'll have more to say about it later. In the meantime, it's an honor to have the prime minister of Italy with us. Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10024.36s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. Everybody loves her and respects her. And I can't say that about many people. And she's become a friend. And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10039.36s)]
*  And we talked about trade. We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. And it's nice to have you with us. Thank you very much. [[02:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10058.36s)]
*  Thank you very much. Mr. President, thank you for your warm welcome. Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relation, our friendship that comes from Grifo. [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10071.36s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Christopher Colombo to make his trip. And I say to remember our ancient ties, but also to remind that we both share another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like to erase our history. [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10083.36s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10112.36s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10129.36s)]
*  And Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. I think there can be ways to work together. And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[02:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10146.36s)]
*  And as you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billion. That shows how interconnected our economies are. And that's very important, Mr. President. It's not only about Italy. It's about the entire Europe. [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10168.36s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. Investments, trade. It's a topic that we are discussing in the trade. But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. I don't know if it is the right word. [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10183.36s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about such a graphical space. I speak about the civilization. And I want to make that civilization stronger. So I think even if we have some problems, okay, between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[02:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10203.36s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[02:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10225.36s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. And we will keep on working on that. I'm going to close. I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy today as a very good situation despite the difficulties. [[02:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10242.36s)]
*  A stable country, a reliable country, one million more jobs in the last two years and a half. Inflation is going down. So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[02:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10262.36s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. Also in Ukraine, I will close together. We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. We can build a just and lasting peace. We support your efforts. [[02:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10278.36s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you very much. And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. We want to save on average. Think of it every week. Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian Ukrainian soldiers. [[02:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10294.36s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. And so we'll see what we can do. And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. And you've been very helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Any questions? [[02:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10310.36s)]
*  How much longer does Wagner-Kuhn have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before you put secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10322.36s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually. And we'll see. But we wanted to stop. We want the death and the killing to stop. [[02:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10336.36s)]
*  Stop. You said that the termination of Rome, how did not come fast enough? He says he won't leave it even if you ask him to. Oh, he'll leave. If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[02:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10349.36s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. I let him know it. And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. Believe me. Go ahead, please. Question. Yeah, question. [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10366.36s)]
*  Well, you're gonna have to speak to the lawyers. We have great lawyers. I can tell you this. We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into the country. Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10397.36s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. A lot of reasons. The economy, a lot of things. But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. I'm going to get them out. And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. As you know, we want everything. The popular vote, all seven swing states. We want everything. And I'm going to get them out. [[02:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10413.36s)]
*  That's what the public wanted. That's what I'm doing. But you have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[02:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10443.36s)]

*  Please. We discussed it very briefly. We're doing very well with negotiations, I think with all countries. And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. Go ahead, Scott. Would you say something?

*  We're working on the big 15 economies. We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. I believe there's been a call with the EU already. And then we have South Korea coming in next week. And I believe India is also talking. That's moving very quickly. [[02:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10498.36s)]

*  And they were screaming at me, the press — the fake news, like you, you're fake. [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10931.82s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10935.939999999999s)]
*  I said, I've only been here — this is my seventh day. [[03:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10939.619999999999s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10943.58s)]
*  They said, You won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[03:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10946.74s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[03:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10949.699999999999s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[03:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10951.419999999998s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[03:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10953.619999999999s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place, and the price went down 92 percent. [[03:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10955.140000000001s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[03:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10960.460000000001s)]
*  Didn't really have done a fantastic job. [[03:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10966.140000000001s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10968.220000000001s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[03:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10969.460000000001s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[03:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10972.94s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[03:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10977.300000000001s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10981.06s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[03:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10983.900000000001s)]
*  They should be coming down. [[03:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10985.140000000001s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10987.26s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10991.02s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[03:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10994.460000000001s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[03:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=10996.86s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11000.980000000001s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11003.460000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir. Please. [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11008.1s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11013.460000000001s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11018.460000000001s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11023.06s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain, [[03:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11026.06s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11028.94s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[03:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11034.34s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[03:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11036.259999999998s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[03:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11041.259999999998s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[03:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11044.619999999999s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore, [[03:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11047.34s)]
*  because we have a real president. [[03:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11052.9s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[03:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11054.859999999999s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[03:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11058.699999999999s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, or they didn't like business, or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[03:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11062.98s)]
*  And then you had, like, the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11068.58s)]
*  That's about all they could do. They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11072.939999999999s)]
*  They were incompetent. Worst administration in the history of our country. [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11075.5s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[03:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11079.9s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. [[03:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11083.22s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11087.02s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[03:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11089.140000000001s)]
*  It's happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11094.220000000001s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them, because that's what's going to happen. [[03:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11096.82s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11101.380000000001s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[03:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11103.7s)]
*  And I think I think I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[03:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11105.34s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[03:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11118.7s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[03:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11121.34s)]
*  OK, go ahead, please. [[03:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11122.900000000001s)]
*  Please. [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11127.380000000001s)]
*  Oh, you have a great prime minister. [[03:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11130.62s)]
*  You're so lucky. Yes. [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11132.26s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's OK. [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11134.54s)]
*  I'm not sure that. [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11136.220000000001s)]
*  We've been talking about the maximum limit at which Italy can reach. [[03:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11148.7s)]
*  We've been talking about the fact that Italy is keeping up its commitments because it will reach the next peak of NATO. [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11156.820000000002s)]
*  With the 2% that was already planned, that has been signed by previous governments. [[03:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11163.740000000002s)]
*  Because we are a serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this percentage has increased. [[03:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11168.78s)]
*  And I think that's a very important issue. [[03:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11175.14s)]
*  And I think that's a very important issue. [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11180.5s)]
*  And I think that's a very important issue. [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11182.74s)]

*  That sounded absolutely... That was so beautiful. What the hell was that? [[03:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11204.42s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[03:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11210.42s)]
*  No, I mean it sounded great. [[03:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11212.42s)]
*  It was about... [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11214.42s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[03:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11216.42s)]
*  Maybe I could hear what she said. [[03:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11218.42s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11220.42s)]

*  Go ahead. [[03:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11233.06s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11235.06s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11237.06s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. [[03:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11239.06s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[03:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11241.06s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11243.06s)]
*  President... [[03:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11245.06s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney was asked whether... [[03:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11247.06s)]
*  What she thinks about the fact that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11249.06s)]
*  And Prime Minister Maloney answered, well... [[03:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11257.06s)]
*  Actually, we have... [[03:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11261.699999999999s)]
*  No. [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11265.699999999999s)]
*  And also, you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending. [[03:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11267.699999999999s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[03:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11273.699999999999s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2%. [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11282.699999999999s)]
*  And then we will see, because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... [[03:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11287.34s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11293.34s)]
*  I will do that. [[03:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11295.34s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another percentage about the defense spending. [[03:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11297.34s)]
*  Right, NATO. [[03:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11303.34s)]
*  Yes, NATO. [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11305.34s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2% as it was already decided. [[03:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11307.34s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage. [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11311.34s)]
*  But we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future. [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11315.98s)]
*  And we see also the war that we are trying to do at the European level. [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11319.98s)]
*  And I don't hold... [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11323.98s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible. [[03:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11325.98s)]
*  No. [[03:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11327.98s)]
*  But I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11329.98s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[03:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11333.98s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11337.98s)]
*  Cities that would be open and thriving and that have their beautiful terraces. [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11342.619999999999s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world. [[03:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11346.619999999999s)]
*  But they're not with us any longer. [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11348.619999999999s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground in a million pieces. [[03:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11350.619999999999s)]
*  Getting hit by rockets, bombs and bullets. [[03:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11354.619999999999s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him. [[03:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11358.619999999999s)]
*  And I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11362.619999999999s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[03:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11364.619999999999s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11366.619999999999s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[03:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11368.619999999999s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11371.26s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11373.26s)]
*  But there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[03:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11375.26s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop. [[03:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11377.26s)]
*  Because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[03:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11379.26s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[03:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11385.26s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[03:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11387.26s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[03:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11393.26s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[03:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11397.26s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that... [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11399.9s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. [[03:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11401.9s)]
*  If I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11403.9s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[03:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11405.9s)]
*  But what I am saying is that... [[03:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11407.9s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[03:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11409.9s)]
*  Okay? [[03:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11411.9s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[03:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11413.9s)]
*  I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11415.9s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11417.9s)]

*  Go ahead. [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11421.9s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11423.9s)]
*  Mr. President, are you sure about the definition of a parasite? [[03:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11429.9s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11435.9s)]
*  That European parasites... [[03:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11437.9s)]
*  He's never said that. [[03:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11439.9s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[03:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11441.9s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11443.9s)]
*  No. I haven't said it. [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11445.9s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[03:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11447.9s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11449.9s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11451.9s)]
*  No, no, wait. Wait. [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11453.9s)]
*  Next. Next. Next. Go. [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11455.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11458.539999999999s)]
*  Foreign Minister Milley just said you want to make Europe great again. [[03:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11460.539999999999s)]
*  And we want to do it together. Together. [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11464.539999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[03:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11466.539999999999s)]
*  Did you... I guess that's what you said. [[03:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11468.539999999999s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to do that? [[03:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11470.539999999999s)]
*  And are you looking to do it to counter China? [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11472.539999999999s)]
*  Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[03:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11476.539999999999s)]
*  What is the health of this joint effort? [[03:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11480.539999999999s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[03:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11482.539999999999s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems. [[03:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11484.539999999999s)]
*  And a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[03:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11487.18s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[03:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11489.18s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart. [[03:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11495.18s)]
*  Because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[03:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11497.18s)]
*  Now, I'll say this. [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11501.18s)]
*  That the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[03:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11503.18s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11507.18s)]
*  I said I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11509.18s)]
*  But they're not. [[03:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11513.18s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[03:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11515.82s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[03:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11517.82s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11519.82s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[03:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11521.82s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[03:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11525.82s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[03:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11527.82s)]
*  At the beginning we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11535.82s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[03:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11542.46s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[03:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11552.46s)]
*  So things are changing. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11558.46s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[03:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11560.46s)]
*  So we are working now together. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11568.46s)]
*  I'm optimistic on that. [[03:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11571.099999999999s)]
*  I hope so. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11573.099999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11575.099999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11577.099999999999s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romney, if you have discussed the option of expanding here with Italy on civil rights communications. [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11579.099999999999s)]
*  And President Trump, if you want to see the Google company. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11587.099999999999s)]
*  The Google what? [[03:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11591.099999999999s)]
*  The Google company. [[03:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11593.099999999999s)]
*  The Google business. [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11595.099999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11597.099999999999s)]
*  We didn't discuss about Starlink. [[03:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11599.74s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11601.74s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[03:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11605.74s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11609.74s)]
*  Any other views from the Prime Minister that changed your mind potentially about terrorists and what you plan to do going forward? [[03:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11619.74s)]
*  No. [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11626.38s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[03:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11628.38s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[03:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11630.38s)]
*  Trillions of dollars. [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11634.38s)]
*  Trillions on trade. [[03:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11636.38s)]
*  And now that whole tide has turned. [[03:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11638.38s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[03:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11640.38s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[03:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11642.38s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25% on cars, 25% on steel, 25% on aluminum, 10% baseline. [[03:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11644.38s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11653.019999999999s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25% for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[03:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11657.019999999999s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11667.019999999999s)]
*  And we didn't do, we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden. [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11673.019999999999s)]
*  Which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point probably $700 billion. [[03:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11679.66s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11685.66s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[03:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11687.66s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[03:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11689.66s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[03:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11691.66s)]
*  The family got paid money, he did. [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11693.66s)]
*  And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[03:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11695.66s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11699.66s)]
*  I took in in the up till this point my tariffs on China. [[03:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11708.3s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[03:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11714.3s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[03:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11716.3s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[03:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11718.3s)]
*  So we're doing very well. [[03:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11720.3s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11724.3s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the healthcare companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11726.3s)]
*  But this is about that. [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11734.3s)]
*  We're building a base. [[03:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11736.939999999999s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[03:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11738.939999999999s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far. [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11740.939999999999s)]
*  The history of any country probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[03:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11742.939999999999s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[03:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11746.939999999999s)]
*  Can you describe the miracle? [[03:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11748.939999999999s)]
*  Will that be signed here at the White House with Ukraine on Thursday? [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11750.939999999999s)]
*  Will presidents mostly be coming here for that? [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11752.939999999999s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[03:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11754.939999999999s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[03:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11756.939999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11758.939999999999s)]
*  Where would it be signed and when? [[03:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11760.939999999999s)]
*  We're still working on it. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11762.939999999999s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[03:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11765.58s)]
*  We're shooting for around a year and a half. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11767.58s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[03:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11769.58s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11773.58s)]
*  But the president was here. [[03:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11777.58s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[03:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11779.58s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal. [[03:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11781.58s)]
*  And I think it's an 80-page agreement. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11783.58s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[03:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11787.58s)]
*  President Trump, on recuts, can you clarify on recuts? [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11789.58s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell firing if he doesn't change his stance on recuts? [[03:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11794.22s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[03:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11800.22s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the recuts. [[03:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11802.22s)]
*  Because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11804.22s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11808.22s)]
*  So I think he should do the recuts. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11810.22s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[03:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11812.22s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11814.22s)]
*  Oil is great. [[03:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11816.22s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11818.22s)]
*  And that's because of the oil. [[03:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11820.22s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11822.859999999999s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11824.859999999999s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11830.859999999999s)]
*  And food is down. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11836.859999999999s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[03:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11838.859999999999s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11842.859999999999s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[03:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11844.859999999999s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[03:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11846.859999999999s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11848.859999999999s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[03:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11851.5s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[03:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11855.5s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11857.5s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[03:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11859.5s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11861.5s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[03:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11863.5s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[03:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11865.5s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[03:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11867.5s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11869.5s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot. [[03:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11871.5s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[03:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11875.5s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11877.5s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 [[03:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11880.14s)]
*  instead of $4.50. [[03:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11884.14s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11886.14s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11892.14s)]
*  That was really, it was not good. [[03:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11894.14s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[03:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11896.14s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2.00. [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11902.14s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[03:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11904.779999999999s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11906.779999999999s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11908.779999999999s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11912.779999999999s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11918.779999999999s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[03:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11920.779999999999s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11924.779999999999s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political power. [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11926.779999999999s)]
*  And I think that's going to be a big problem. [[03:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11928.779999999999s)]
*  I think at some point he will. [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11931.42s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[03:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11933.42s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[03:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11935.42s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11937.42s)]
*  Okay? [[03:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11941.42s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11943.42s)]
*  Please. [[03:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11945.42s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe? [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11947.42s)]
*  And also, do you have a notice when you walk into the finance? [[03:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11949.42s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11953.42s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[03:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11960.06s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies. [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11962.06s)]
*  Not just in Europe, anywhere. [[03:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11966.06s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11968.06s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[03:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11972.06s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country. [[03:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11974.06s)]
*  I tell you. [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11976.06s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11978.06s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=11980.06s)]

*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12010.699999999999s)]
*  in Tallahassee, active shooting. [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12015.34s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12017.34s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[03:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12019.34s)]
*  It's a shame. [[03:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12023.34s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12025.34s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12027.34s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[03:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12029.34s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us. [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12031.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12037.34s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[03:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12041.98s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12047.98s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12049.98s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[03:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12051.98s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12053.98s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12059.98s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[03:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12061.98s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words. [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12065.98s)]
*  But she's a very special person. [[03:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12067.98s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[03:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12070.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12072.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[03:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12074.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[03:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12076.619999999999s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship. [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12078.619999999999s)]
*  That comes from Grifo. [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12084.619999999999s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. [[03:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12086.619999999999s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Christopher Colombo to make his trip. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12088.619999999999s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[03:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12097.26s)]
*  which is the fight against the walk and the ideology that would like to erase our history. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12106.26s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[03:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12114.26s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[03:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12125.9s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together. [[03:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12131.9s)]
*  About defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[03:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12138.9s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12149.539999999999s)]
*  And also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[03:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12154.539999999999s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[03:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12158.539999999999s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[03:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12162.539999999999s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billions. [[03:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12170.539999999999s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[03:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12174.539999999999s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12179.18s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[03:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12181.18s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12185.18s)]
*  Investments, trade. [[03:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12191.18s)]
*  It's a topic that we are discussing in the trade. [[03:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12194.18s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a western nationalism. [[03:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12198.18s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[03:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12204.18s)]
*  I know that when I speak about the West, mainly I don't speak about a geographical space. [[03:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12206.82s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[03:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12211.82s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12213.82s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, [[03:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12216.82s)]
*  it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12222.82s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future. [[03:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12227.82s)]
*  And consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[03:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12236.46s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[03:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12241.46s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[03:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12245.46s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[03:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12249.46s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[03:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12252.46s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy. [[03:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12253.46s)]
*  I believe that today is a very good situation despite the difficulties. [[03:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12258.099999999999s)]
*  A stable country, a reliable country. [[03:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12265.099999999999s)]
*  One million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[03:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12267.099999999999s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[03:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12272.099999999999s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[03:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12274.099999999999s)]
*  So migration flows are going down 60%. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12280.099999999999s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[03:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12284.74s)]
*  Also in Ukraine I will close. [[03:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12288.74s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[03:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12290.74s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[03:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12292.74s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12294.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12296.74s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12297.74s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort. [[03:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12298.74s)]
*  But we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[03:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12300.74s)]
*  We want to save. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12303.74s)]
*  On average, think of it, every week 2,500 people are being killed. [[03:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12305.74s)]
*  Mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[03:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12309.74s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[03:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12313.38s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[03:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12316.38s)]
*  I think we're getting close, but we'll let you know very soon. [[03:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12318.38s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[03:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12321.38s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12322.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12323.38s)]
*  Any questions? [[03:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12324.38s)]
*  How much longer does Vladimir Putin have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before [[03:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12325.38s)]
*  you put secondary tariffs or sanctions on Russia? [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12334.38s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12339.38s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12341.019999999999s)]
*  Very shortly, actually. [[03:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12344.019999999999s)]
*  And we'll see. [[03:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12347.019999999999s)]
*  But we want it to stop. [[03:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12348.019999999999s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[03:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12349.019999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell could [[03:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12352.019999999999s)]
*  not come fast enough. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12357.019999999999s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[03:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12358.019999999999s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. [[03:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12361.019999999999s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. [[03:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12362.019999999999s)]
*  But I don't think he's doing the job. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12364.019999999999s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[03:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12369.66s)]
*  I let him know it. [[03:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12375.66s)]
*  And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12377.66s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[03:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12382.66s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12383.66s)]
*  Question. [[03:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12384.66s)]
*  Yeah, question? [[03:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12385.66s)]
*  Yeah, question? [[03:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12387.3s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[03:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12400.3s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12401.3s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12403.3s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into [[03:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12404.3s)]
*  the country. [[03:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12409.3s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12410.3s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, I would say maybe that was the number one factor, [[03:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12415.939999999999s)]
*  a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[03:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12420.939999999999s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals [[03:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12422.939999999999s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12427.939999999999s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12432.939999999999s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12434.939999999999s)]
*  We won everything. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12438.939999999999s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[03:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12439.939999999999s)]
*  We won everything. [[03:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12442.939999999999s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted and that's what I'm doing. [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12444.58s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[03:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12447.58s)]
*  Say it. [[03:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12450.58s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and the UK of a peace mission in Ukraine with [[03:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12451.58s)]
*  soldiers? [[03:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12458.58s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12459.58s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[03:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12462.58s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[03:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12465.58s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12468.58s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[03:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12469.58s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the Prime [[03:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12471.22s)]
*  Minister of Italy and the United States and Europe? [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12475.22s)]
*  And on China? [[03:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12478.22s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12480.22s)]
*  We're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[03:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12482.22s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[03:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12486.22s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[03:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12491.22s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[03:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12494.22s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[03:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12496.22s)]
*  Would you say something? [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12497.22s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[03:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12498.859999999999s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[03:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12499.859999999999s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[03:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12502.859999999999s)]
*  I believe there's been a call with the EU already. [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12506.859999999999s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[03:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12510.859999999999s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[03:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12513.859999999999s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12517.859999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12522.859999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. Leninsky is a US ambassador to China. [[03:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12524.5s)]
*  He's supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia. [[03:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12527.5s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those lines? [[03:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12530.5s)]
*  And also, he said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[03:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12532.5s)]
*  Is that true? [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12535.5s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[03:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12536.5s)]
*  next Thursday. [[03:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12540.5s)]
*  Soon. [[03:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12541.5s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[03:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12542.5s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[03:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12546.5s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[03:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12548.5s)]
*  I have no idea. [[03:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12551.5s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[03:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12553.14s)]
*  Mr. President, I believe you waved off an Israeli nuclear attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[03:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12554.14s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[03:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12559.14s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[03:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12561.14s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12562.14s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[03:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12564.14s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[03:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12569.14s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[03:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12571.14s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12576.14s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[03:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12580.14s)]
*  That's my first option. [[03:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12581.779999999999s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[03:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12582.779999999999s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[03:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12589.779999999999s)]

*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[03:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12594.779999999999s)]

*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[03:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12606.14s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12610.74s)]
*  I really don't. [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12614.34s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[03:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12615.34s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[03:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12618.02s)]
*  It's really simple. [[03:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12619.699999999999s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[03:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12621.46s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[03:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12624.26s)]

*  The deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have expired already. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12630.42s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12636.18s)]
*  It would have expired. [[03:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12637.86s)]
*  That gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12640.699999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[03:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12643.099999999999s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12644.099999999999s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[03:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12645.619999999999s)]
*  When countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[03:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12647.939999999999s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[03:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12651.699999999999s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[03:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12654.42s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated. [[03:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12657.179999999998s)]
*  You know what the deal was. [[03:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12661.58s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[03:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12662.58s)]
*  Really. [[03:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12664.06s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the US. [[03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12665.06s)]
*  But no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[03:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12668.54s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[03:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12673.26s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[03:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12675.86s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[03:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12678.06s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[03:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12679.62s)]

*  Garcia to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[03:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12707.78s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[03:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12710.9s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[03:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12712.18s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[03:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12718.06s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[03:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12720.62s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people [[03:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12725.42s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[03:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12732.380000000001s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12733.94s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[03:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12736.58s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[03:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12740.74s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[03:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12744.54s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12748.86s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, or to put [[03:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12754.060000000001s)]
*  them away, but to get them out of our country. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12758.62s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[03:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12761.82s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12766.02s)]

*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[03:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12771.82s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12774.1s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[03:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12775.1s)]
*  We have, right now, 99 percent border. [[03:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12777.58s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12780.220000000001s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be possible. [[03:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12782.1s)]
*  Nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[03:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12783.54s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[03:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12785.58s)]
*  We allowed them. [[03:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12790.1s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[03:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12791.1s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12795.98s)]
*  We have a great border. [[03:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12798.06s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[03:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12799.06s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12803.66s)]
*  And, you know, we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people [[03:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12807.18s)]
*  that were in jail for horrible. [[03:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12814.06s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world and released them, not [[03:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12816.26s)]
*  just South America, all over the world. [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12822.460000000001s)]

*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[03:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12827.78s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails. [[03:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12831.74s)]
*  Venezuela. [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12835.220000000001s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[03:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12836.34s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration. [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12838.98s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[03:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12846.099999999999s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12849.38s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[03:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12852.019999999999s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[03:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12854.019999999999s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[03:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12859.14s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[03:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12865.5s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[03:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12867.5s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[03:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12871.5s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12875.5s)]
*  Mr. President, back on the street, Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals will be done. [[03:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12877.5s)]
*  But you also said that you're in no rush. [[03:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12884.5s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[03:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12886.5s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[03:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12888.5s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12890.5s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better. [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12893.14s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12896.14s)]

*  And they were right. [[03:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12944.779999999999s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[03:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12945.779999999999s)]

*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[03:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12951.42s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[03:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12952.42s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12955.42s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[03:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12956.92s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[03:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12961.92s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[03:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12967.92s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[03:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12969.92s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve [[03:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12970.92s)]

*  But he's playing politics. [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12983.06s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[03:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12985.06s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. [[03:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12987.06s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them seven times. [[03:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12989.06s)]

*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[03:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12996.06s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[03:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=12998.06s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[03:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13002.06s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[03:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13005.199999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13010.199999999999s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[03:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13011.199999999999s)]
*  Please. [[03:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13012.199999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13013.199999999999s)]
*  Please. [[03:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13014.199999999999s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13015.199999999999s)]
*  Stock market went up 88 points. [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13025.199999999999s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration [[03:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13027.199999999999s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[03:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13033.94s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the numbers [[03:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13035.94s)]
*  that we're taking in are astronomical. [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13040.94s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[03:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13042.94s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[03:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13045.94s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13048.94s)]
*  to us anymore because we have a real president. [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13053.94s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[03:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13055.94s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart but they didn't understand business [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13060.880000000001s)]
*  or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[03:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13065.880000000001s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating [[03:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13069.880000000001s)]
*  in elections. [[03:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13073.880000000001s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[03:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13074.880000000001s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13075.880000000001s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[03:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13076.880000000001s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[03:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13077.880000000001s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[03:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13080.880000000001s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[03:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13082.880000000001s)]
*  You know why? [[03:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13084.880000000001s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[03:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13085.880000000001s)]
*  He was the worst president that Joe Biden was. [[03:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13089.82s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[03:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13091.82s)]
*  It's happening now. [[03:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13095.82s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[03:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13096.82s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them. [[03:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13098.82s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13101.82s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[03:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13103.82s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[03:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13105.82s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're [[03:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13107.82s)]
*  listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[03:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13117.76s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[03:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13120.76s)]
*  That's what we'll be doing. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13123.76s)]
*  Okay? [[03:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13125.76s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13126.76s)]
*  Please. [[03:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13127.76s)]
*  Oh, you have a great prime minister. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13128.76s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[03:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13133.76s)]
*  Yes. [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13134.76s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[03:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13135.76s)]
*  That's right. [[03:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13136.76s)]
*  Okay. [[03:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13137.76s)]
*  I'm not sure that would make a difference. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13138.76s)]
*  President Veroni, I'd like to know what you thought about the fact that President Trump [[03:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13140.7s)]
*  considered Zelensky responsible for the Ukrainian war. [[03:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13144.7s)]
*  And then if you had talked about the expenses in Italy, what is the maximum limit that [[03:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13147.7s)]
*  you said you want to reach in Italy, the percentage of the expenses in Italy? [[03:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13152.7s)]
*  We talked about the maximum limit that Italy wants to reach. [[03:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13155.7s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is keeping its commitments because it will reach the [[03:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13158.7s)]
*  next NATO advantage with the 2%, which was already planned, which was signed by the [[03:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13163.7s)]
*  previous governments because we are a serious nation, but we didn't talk about how much [[03:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13169.640000000001s)]
*  this percentage will increase, even if we are obviously aware that the defense issue [[03:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13174.640000000001s)]
*  is a particularly important issue of this time. [[03:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13179.640000000001s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, I think there was clearly an invasion and that the [[03:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13182.640000000001s)]
*  invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, but that's not what reveals the [[03:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13188.640000000001s)]
*  fact that together we want to work, we are working to try to achieve a peace in Ukraine [[03:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13195.58s)]
*  that can be just and lasting. [[03:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13203.58s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we are making to share our work. [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13206.58s)]
*  We have also shared our voice today. [[03:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13210.58s)]
*  President, could you please introduce yourself? [[03:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13213.58s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... [[03:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13216.58s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13219.58s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[03:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13221.58s)]
*  No, I mean it sounded great. [[03:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13224.52s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[03:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13226.52s)]
*  Maybe I could hear what she said. [[03:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13228.52s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[03:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13232.52s)]

*  No, no, wait. [[03:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13241.52s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13243.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13245.52s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Malone was asked what she thinks about the fact that President [[03:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13247.52s)]
*  Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine and Prime Minister Malone answered [[03:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13253.460000000001s)]
*  well, actually we have... [[03:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13261.460000000001s)]
*  No, and also you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13266.460000000001s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is that no, actually we didn't raise [[03:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13275.460000000001s)]
*  the military spending. [[03:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13283.460000000001s)]
*  Of course Italy will keep its commitments with 2% and then we will see because we are [[03:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13284.460000000001s)]
*  absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... [[03:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13289.460000000001s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[03:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13294.460000000001s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[03:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13295.460000000001s)]
*  I will do that. [[03:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13296.460000000001s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defensive percentage about the defense spending [[03:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13297.460000000001s)]
*  and I said yes, NATO. [[03:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13305.460000000001s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2% as it was already decided. [[03:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13308.4s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage but we are aware of the fact that defense [[03:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13312.4s)]
*  is important for the future and we see also the war that we are trying to do at the European [[03:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13319.4s)]
*  left. [[03:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13326.4s)]
*  And I don't hold... [[03:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13327.4s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that [[03:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13328.4s)]
*  war started. [[03:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13335.8s)]
*  This is a war that would have never started if I were president. [[03:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13337.14s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[03:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13340.14s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving and they'd have their beautiful [[03:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13343.14s)]
*  turrets. [[03:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13347.14s)]
*  Those turrets are the most beautiful in the world but they're not with us any longer. [[03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13348.14s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit by [[03:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13352.14s)]
*  rockets, bombs and bullets. [[03:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13358.14s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13361.14s)]
*  I think it's a war... [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13366.48s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[03:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13367.48s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[03:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13368.48s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[03:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13369.48s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[03:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13370.48s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13372.48s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[03:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13375.48s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop because as you know Russia's a lot bigger. [[03:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13379.48s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[03:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13386.48s)]
*  And if you're smart you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13389.82s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[03:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13395.82s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[03:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13398.82s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that... [[03:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13401.82s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. [[03:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13402.82s)]
*  If I were president that war would have never taken place. [[03:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13404.82s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13407.82s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[03:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13408.82s)]

*  Mr. President, are you sure about the definition of a parasite for Europeans? [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13431.16s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[03:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13438.16s)]
*  That Europeans are parasites? [[03:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13440.16s)]
*  He's never said it. [[03:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13441.16s)]
*  Could you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[03:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13442.16s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[03:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13444.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13446.16s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[03:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13447.5s)]
*  No. [[03:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13448.5s)]
*  I haven't said it. [[03:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13449.5s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[03:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13450.5s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13451.5s)]

*  Thank you. [[03:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13458.5s)]
*  Prime Minister Nuland just said you want to make Europe great again. [[03:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13459.5s)]
*  And we want to do it together. [[03:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13464.5s)]
*  Together. [[03:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13467.5s)]
*  In the West. [[03:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13468.5s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said. [[03:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13469.5s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to do that? [[03:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13471.84s)]
*  And are you looking to do it to counter China, who is really trying to gather influence [[03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13474.84s)]
*  against the United States with the help of this government? [[03:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13481.84s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13484.84s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13487.84s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13491.84s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've [[03:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13497.18s)]
*  done with immigration. [[03:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13502.92s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[03:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13503.92s)]
*  And I commented to her before, I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do [[03:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13510.76s)]
*  with that subject, but they're not. [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13515.04s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[03:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13518.92s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[03:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13520.72s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13522.36s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[03:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13524.439999999999s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[03:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13527.439999999999s)]
*  You've seen, you will see now the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13529.439999999999s)]
*  two and a half years have been changing. [[03:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13535.439999999999s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants [[03:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13537.439999999999s)]
*  coming to Italy. [[03:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13543.439999999999s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries [[03:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13544.439999999999s)]
*  of origin and transit, and to return people. [[03:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13550.439999999999s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[03:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13553.74s)]
*  So things are changing, thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the [[03:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13559.74s)]
*  rates of illegal migration. [[03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13566.74s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[03:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13568.74s)]
*  I'm optimistic on that. [[03:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13572.74s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13575.039999999999s)]
*  Go ahead. [[03:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13579.039999999999s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romani, if you have discussed the option of starting here [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13581.039999999999s)]
*  with Italy on satellite communications, and President Trump, if you want to see the Google [[03:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13586.039999999999s)]
*  company, what about it? [[03:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13592.039999999999s)]
*  The Google what? [[03:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13594.039999999999s)]
*  The Google company. [[03:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13595.039999999999s)]
*  What about it? [[03:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13596.039999999999s)]
*  The Google business. [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13597.039999999999s)]
*  If you want to see it now, it's a great idea. [[03:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13598.039999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13600.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[03:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13601.039999999999s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13604.34s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[03:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13608.34s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13613.34s)]
*  On your previous comments, you said that you are making your public view as Prime Minister [[03:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13617.34s)]
*  that changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you plan to do going forward. [[03:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13624.34s)]
*  No. [[03:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13628.34s)]
*  But you said to you that changed your perspective. [[03:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13629.34s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13630.34s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden, trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[03:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13632.64s)]
*  And now that whole tide has turned. [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13640.64s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[03:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13643.64s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13645.64s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on [[03:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13646.64s)]
*  aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[03:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13652.64s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[03:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13655.64s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing [[03:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13658.939999999999s)]
*  the borders to be weak. [[03:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13666.939999999999s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13668.939999999999s)]
*  And we didn't take in anything before, other than the tariffs that I put on previous to [[03:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13674.939999999999s)]
*  Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China, where we took in up until this point probably [[03:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13679.939999999999s)]
*  $700 billion. [[03:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13684.939999999999s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13687.24s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[03:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13689.24s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[03:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13691.24s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[03:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13692.24s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13694.24s)]
*  He did. [[03:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13695.24s)]
*  And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[03:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13696.24s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13700.24s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[03:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13705.24s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China. [[03:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13708.24s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[03:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13715.539999999999s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[03:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13717.539999999999s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[03:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13719.539999999999s)]
*  So we're doing very well. [[03:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13722.539999999999s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[03:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13725.539999999999s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on [[03:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13727.539999999999s)]
*  the stock market. [[03:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13733.539999999999s)]
*  But this is about that. [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13734.539999999999s)]
*  This is really, we're building a base. [[03:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13736.539999999999s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[03:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13738.539999999999s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far. [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13740.539999999999s)]
*  History of any country probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[03:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13744.84s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[03:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13748.84s)]
*  What do you think about the five-year plan? [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13751.84s)]
*  Will that be signed here at the White House with Ukraine on Thursday? [[03:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13753.84s)]
*  Will presidents mostly be coming here for that? [[03:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13757.84s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[03:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13759.84s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[03:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13761.84s)]
*  What do you think? [[03:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13763.84s)]
*  Where would it be signed and when? [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13765.84s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[03:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13767.84s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 26th. [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13769.84s)]
*  Can you tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[03:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13772.14s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously when the president was here. [[03:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13774.14s)]
*  We had a numbering of understanding. [[03:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13782.14s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal. [[03:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13784.14s)]
*  And I think it's an 80-page agreement. [[03:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13786.14s)]
*  And that's what we'll be signing. [[03:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13789.14s)]
*  President Trump, on rate cuts, can you clarify on rate cuts? [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13791.14s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell firing if he doesn't change his stand on rate cuts? [[03:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13796.439999999999s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[03:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13802.439999999999s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, [[03:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13804.439999999999s)]
*  it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13808.439999999999s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[03:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13810.439999999999s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[03:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13813.439999999999s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[03:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13815.439999999999s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[03:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13817.439999999999s)]
*  Oil is great. [[03:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13820.439999999999s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[03:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13822.439999999999s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[03:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13824.74s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[03:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13826.74s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[03:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13832.74s)]
*  And food is down. [[03:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13837.74s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[03:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13840.74s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[03:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13844.74s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[03:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13846.74s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[03:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13848.74s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[03:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13850.74s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[03:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13853.039999999999s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13857.039999999999s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[03:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13859.039999999999s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[03:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13861.039999999999s)]
*  It's hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[03:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13863.039999999999s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[03:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13865.039999999999s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[03:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13867.039999999999s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13869.039999999999s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[03:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13871.039999999999s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, [[03:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13873.039999999999s)]
*  we've gotten it down really good. [[03:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13878.039999999999s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13880.039999999999s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[03:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13882.34s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[03:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13890.34s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[03:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13895.34s)]
*  That was really, it was not good. [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13898.34s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[03:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13900.34s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[03:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13908.34s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13910.64s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13912.64s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[03:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13914.64s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[03:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13918.64s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[03:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13926.64s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13928.64s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[03:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13931.64s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13934.64s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13936.64s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[03:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13939.939999999999s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[03:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13947.939999999999s)]
*  Please. [[03:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13948.939999999999s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[03:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13955.939999999999s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[03:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13960.939999999999s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[03:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13964.24s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[03:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13969.24s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13973.24s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country. [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13976.24s)]
*  I tell you. [[03:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13978.24s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[03:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13979.24s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[03:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13983.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13984.24s)]
*  Thank you. [[03:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13985.24s)]
*  Thank you, big guys. [[03:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=13994.24s)]

*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14012.24s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee, active shooting. [[03:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14013.24s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[03:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14019.24s)]
*  I've been fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[03:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14022.539999999999s)]
*  It's a shame. [[03:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14026.539999999999s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[03:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14027.539999999999s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[03:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14028.539999999999s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14031.539999999999s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister [[03:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14034.539999999999s)]
*  Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14040.94s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14043.94s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[03:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14049.84s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[03:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14051.84s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[03:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14054.84s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14057.44s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14062.84s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14064.640000000001s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14068.84s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[03:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14073.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14074.94s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[03:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14075.94s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14078.34s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship [[03:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14081.34s)]
*  that comes from Grifo. [[03:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14086.34s)]
*  You know, today is April 17th. [[03:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14087.34s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Cristoforo Colombo [[03:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14090.34s)]
*  to make his trip. [[03:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14097.34s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share [[03:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14099.44s)]
*  another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like [[03:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14107.140000000001s)]
*  to erase our history. [[03:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14114.44s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting [[03:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14116.84s)]
*  against synthetic drugs. [[03:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14125.640000000001s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[03:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14127.04s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[03:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14133.74s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14141.34s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports. [[03:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14152.14s)]
*  And also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[03:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14158.14s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[03:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14160.74s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest, as they've been doing for many years, as you [[03:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14164.539999999999s)]
*  know, in the next years, I think around 10 billions. [[03:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14172.84s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[03:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14177.44s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[03:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14181.039999999999s)]
*  It's not only about Italy. [[03:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14182.74s)]
*  It's about the entire Europe. [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14184.64s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[03:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14187.14s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the trade. [[03:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14193.439999999999s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14200.24s)]
*  nationalism. [[03:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14204.84s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14205.84s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[03:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14207.539999999999s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[03:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14213.539999999999s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[03:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14216.14s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14218.439999999999s)]
*  time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14225.34s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official [[03:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14229.64s)]
*  visit to Rome in the near future and consider a possibility in that occasion to meet also [[03:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14235.64s)]
*  with Europe. [[03:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14242.24s)]
*  But the goal for me is to make the West great again. [[03:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14243.94s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[03:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14247.54s)]
*  We can. [[03:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14249.140000000001s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14251.140000000001s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14254.140000000001s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has [[03:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14255.34s)]
*  very good, has a very good situation despite the difficulties, a stable country, a reliable [[03:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14263.04s)]

*  Inflation is going down. [[03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14273.74s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand [[03:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14276.24s)]

*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[03:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14286.44s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14290.539999999999s)]
*  Together, we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14292.039999999999s)]

*  I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we [[03:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14300.640000000001s)]
*  can. [[03:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14305.740000000002s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[03:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14306.740000000002s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[03:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14308.44s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian [[03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14309.44s)]
*  soldiers. [[03:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14313.54s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[03:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14314.54s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[03:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14318.240000000002s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[03:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14319.740000000002s)]

*  How much longer does Wagner-Kruggen have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before [[03:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14328.34s)]
*  you put secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[03:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14336.94s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[03:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14341.24s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually. [[03:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14343.04s)]

*  But we want it to stop. [[03:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14350.140000000001s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[03:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14351.140000000001s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell cannot [[03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14353.74s)]
*  come fast enough. [[03:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14359.039999999999s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[03:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14360.039999999999s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14363.039999999999s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. [[03:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14364.039999999999s)]
*  But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[03:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14365.64s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[03:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14370.84s)]
*  I let him know it and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. [[03:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14377.74s)]
*  Believe me. [[03:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14383.74s)]

*  Go ahead, please. [[03:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14385.74s)]
*  Question. [[03:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14386.74s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[03:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14389.74s)]
*  But you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14401.74s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[04:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14403.24s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[04:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14405.54s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into [[04:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14406.54s)]
*  the country. [[04:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14411.44s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[04:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14413.240000000002s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, I would say maybe that was the number one factor, [[04:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14418.240000000002s)]
*  a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[04:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14423.240000000002s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals [[04:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14425.240000000002s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[04:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14430.44s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[04:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14435.24s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[04:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14437.24s)]
*  We won everything. [[04:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14441.64s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[04:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14442.64s)]
*  We won everything. [[04:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14445.14s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted and that's what I'm doing. [[04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14446.14s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[04:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14450.14s)]
*  Say it. [[04:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14455.14s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and the UK of a peace mission in Ukraine with [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14456.14s)]
*  soldiers? [[04:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14461.14s)]
*  Do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14462.14s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14465.14s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[04:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14468.14s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[04:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14470.64s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[04:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14472.14s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what your cooperation discussed with the Prime Minister [[04:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14473.14s)]
*  between Italy and the United States and Europe and the United States? [[04:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14478.14s)]
*  And China? [[04:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14481.14s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[04:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14482.14s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[04:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14484.14s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[04:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14488.14s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[04:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14493.14s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[04:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14496.14s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[04:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14498.14s)]
*  Would you say something? [[04:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14499.14s)]
*  Yeah, we've got a process in place. [[04:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14500.14s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[04:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14502.14s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[04:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14505.14s)]
*  I believe there's been calls with the EU already. [[04:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14509.14s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[04:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14512.14s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking better. [[04:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14515.14s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[04:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14520.14s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think the US and China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[04:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14522.14s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[04:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14532.14s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[04:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14534.14s)]
*  Is that true? [[04:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14537.14s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[04:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14538.14s)]
*  and next Thursday. [[04:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14541.14s)]
*  Soon? [[04:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14543.14s)]
*  Yep. [[04:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14544.14s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[04:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14545.14s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[04:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14548.14s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[04:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14551.14s)]
*  I have no idea. [[04:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14553.14s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[04:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14554.14s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[04:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14556.14s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[04:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14562.14s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[04:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14563.14s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14564.14s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[04:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14566.14s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[04:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14571.14s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[04:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14572.14s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[04:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14578.14s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[04:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14582.14s)]
*  That's my first option. [[04:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14583.14s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[04:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14585.14s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[04:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14591.14s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[04:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14595.14s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[04:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14596.14s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[04:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14598.14s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[04:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14604.14s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[04:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14607.14s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[04:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14611.14s)]
*  I really don't. [[04:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14616.14s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[04:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14617.14s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[04:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14619.14s)]
*  It's really simple. [[04:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14621.14s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[04:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14622.14s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[04:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14625.14s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[04:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14628.14s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, [[04:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14631.14s)]
*  that deal would have expired already. [[04:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14635.14s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[04:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14637.14s)]
*  It would have expired. [[04:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14638.14s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[04:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14640.14s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[04:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14644.14s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[04:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14645.14s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[04:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14647.14s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[04:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14648.14s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[04:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14652.14s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[04:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14654.14s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[04:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14657.14s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14661.14s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[04:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14663.14s)]
*  Really. [[04:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14664.14s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[04:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14665.14s)]
*  But, no, I want, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[04:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14668.14s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily, or they can do it the other way. [[04:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14673.14s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[04:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14678.14s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[04:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14680.14s)]
*  The Press. [[04:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14682.14s)]
*  Mr. President, why do you make up an idea of the CEO going to China and met with three officials there? [[04:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14683.14s)]
*  The President. [[04:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14688.14s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[04:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14689.14s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[04:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14691.14s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[04:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14693.14s)]
*  He loves our country. [[04:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14697.14s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[04:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14698.14s)]
*  The Press. [[04:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14700.14s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're holding you in contempt, will you take steps to return Kilmar of Arieco Garcia to the United States of Crete in front of a judge? [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14701.14s)]
*  The President. [[04:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14710.14s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[04:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14711.14s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[04:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14714.14s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[04:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14719.14s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[04:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14722.14s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14727.14s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[04:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14735.14s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14738.14s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminal because they came into the border illegally. [[04:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14742.14s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[04:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14746.14s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person and they're on the loose. [[04:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14750.14s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14755.14s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14763.14s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[04:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14767.14s)]
*  Tom Holman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[04:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14769.14s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[04:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14773.14s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[04:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14775.14s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[04:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14777.14s)]
*  We have right now 99 percent border. [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14779.14s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[04:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14782.14s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, nobody's coming through our border practically. [[04:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14783.14s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through all for medical reasons. [[04:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14788.14s)]
*  We allowed them. [[04:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14791.14s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else, all for medical reasons. [[04:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14792.14s)]
*  We have a great border. [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14799.14s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[04:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14800.14s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[04:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14805.14s)]
*  And, you know, we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that were in jail for horrible. [[04:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14808.14s)]
*  You know, they released jails Georgia from all over the world and released them not just South America, all over the world. [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14818.14s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[04:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14826.14s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[04:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14828.14s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo and all over the world. [[04:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14830.14s)]
*  They came in, opened their jails, Venezuela, practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14834.14s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration and to think what they've done to our country. [[04:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14840.14s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[04:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14850.14s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14853.14s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[04:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14855.14s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[04:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14860.14s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[04:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14866.14s)]
*  I don't know. [[04:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14868.14s)]
*  Maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[04:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14869.14s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[04:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14874.14s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[04:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14877.14s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done, but you also said that you're in no rush. [[04:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14879.14s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14888.14s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14890.14s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[04:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14891.14s)]
*  So they've already seen it get much better because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, you have gasoline that hit. [[04:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14895.14s)]
*  And down in 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[04:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14906.14s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[04:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14911.14s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[04:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14915.14s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[04:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14918.14s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[04:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14920.14s)]
*  I just got there. [[04:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14923.14s)]
*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me, eggs have gone through the roof. [[04:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14924.14s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[04:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14928.14s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[04:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14930.14s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[04:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14935.14s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[04:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14939.14s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[04:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14943.14s)]
*  I just this is my seventh day. [[04:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14944.14s)]
*  And they were right. [[04:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14947.14s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[04:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14948.14s)]
*  They said you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[04:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14950.14s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[04:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14953.14s)]
*  You want to have eggs for Easter. [[04:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14955.14s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[04:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14957.14s)]
*  And now eggs have all over the place. [[04:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14958.14s)]
*  And the price went down 92 percent. [[04:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14960.14s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[04:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14963.14s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[04:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14969.14s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[04:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14971.14s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics. [[04:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14973.14s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[04:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14980.14s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[04:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14984.14s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[04:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14986.14s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. [[04:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14988.14s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them seven times. [[04:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14991.14s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[04:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14994.14s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[04:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14997.14s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[04:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=14999.14s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[04:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15004.14s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[04:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15007.14s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15011.14s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[04:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15012.14s)]
*  Please. [[04:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15013.14s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15014.14s)]
*  Please. [[04:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15015.14s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[04:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15016.14s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[04:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15023.14s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[04:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15026.14s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the stock market is going to go up. [[04:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15034.14s)]
*  Because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[04:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15040.14s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[04:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15045.14s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[04:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15048.14s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real president. [[04:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15051.14s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[04:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15058.14s)]
*  We had presidents that in some cases were smart, but they didn't understand business or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[04:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15062.14s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[04:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15071.14s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[04:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15076.14s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[04:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15077.14s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[04:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15079.14s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[04:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15080.14s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. [[04:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15083.14s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[04:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15084.14s)]
*  You know why? [[04:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15086.14s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[04:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15088.14s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[04:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15090.14s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[04:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15091.14s)]
*  It's happening now. [[04:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15097.14s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[04:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15098.14s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them because that's what's going to happen. [[04:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15100.14s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[04:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15104.14s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[04:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15107.14s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[04:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15108.14s)]
*  But, you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[04:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15119.14s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[04:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15122.14s)]
*  OK. [[04:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15124.14s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[04:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15125.14s)]
*  Please. [[04:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15126.14s)]
*  Question. [[04:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15127.14s)]
*  Today, our Prime Minister. [[04:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15128.14s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[04:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15130.14s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[04:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15132.14s)]
*  Yes. [[04:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15133.14s)]
*  In Italian. [[04:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15134.14s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[04:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15135.14s)]
*  OK. [[04:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15136.14s)]
*  I'm not sure that they do it right. [[04:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15137.14s)]
*  Presidente, I want to know what you thought about the fact that President Trump considered [[04:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15138.14s)]
*  the Ukrainian government responsible for the Ukraine crisis. [[04:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15143.14s)]
*  And then, if he had talked about the Italian expenses, what is the maximum limit that he [[04:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15146.14s)]
*  said Italy can reach, the percentage of the Italian expenses? [[04:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15151.14s)]
*  We talked about the maximum limit that Italy can reach. [[04:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15154.14s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is keeping its commitments because it is going to be [[04:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15157.14s)]
*  the next NATO advantage with the 2%, which was already planned, which was underwritten [[04:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15162.14s)]
*  by the previous governments. [[04:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15167.14s)]
*  Because we are a serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this percentage [[04:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15169.14s)]
*  will increase, even though we are obviously aware that the defense issue is a particularly [[04:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15174.14s)]
*  important issue at this time. [[04:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15179.14s)]
*  As far as the war in Ukraine is concerned, as I think, I think there was an invasion [[04:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15181.14s)]
*  and that the invader, from that point of view, was Putin and Russia, but that is not what [[04:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15187.14s)]
*  reveals the fact that together we want to work, we are working to try to achieve [[04:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15197.14s)]
*  a peace in Ukraine that can be right and lasting. [[04:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15204.14s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we are making to share our work. [[04:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15207.14s)]
*  That sounded absolutely, that was so beautiful. [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15212.14s)]
*  What did she say? [[04:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15222.14s)]
*  Please. [[04:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15225.14s)]
*  I mean it sounded great. [[04:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15226.14s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[04:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15228.14s)]
*  Maybe I could hear what she said. [[04:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15230.14s)]
*  Please. [[04:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15233.14s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15234.14s)]
*  Hold it. [[04:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15235.14s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[04:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15236.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15237.14s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[04:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15239.14s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[04:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15243.14s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15246.14s)]
*  The Prime Minister Maloney was asked what she thinks about the fact that President Trump [[04:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15247.14s)]
*  holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, and Prime Minister Maloney answered, [[04:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15256.14s)]
*  Well, actually, we have – no, and also if you talked about the military spending and [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15263.14s)]
*  the raising of the military spending, and the first thing Prime Minister Maroni said [[04:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15275.9s)]
*  is that no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[04:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15281.939999999999s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, and then we will see, because [[04:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15286.42s)]
*  we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to – defense is very important. [[04:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15291.78s)]
*  I will do that. [[04:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15298.86s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defensive percentage about the defense spending, [[04:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15299.86s)]
*  and I said, yes, NATO, and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already [[04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15306.94s)]
*  decided. [[04:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15313.58s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that [[04:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15314.58s)]
*  defense is important for the future, and we see also the war that we are trying to [[04:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15320.62s)]
*  do at the European level. [[04:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15326.7s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that [[04:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15329.34s)]
*  that war started. [[04:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15337.54s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[04:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15338.54s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[04:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15342.26s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have beautiful terraces. [[04:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15345.54s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[04:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15349.66s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15353.98s)]
*  by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[04:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15359.58s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[04:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15362.9s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[04:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15368.06s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[04:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15369.22s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[04:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15370.22s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[04:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15371.78s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[04:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15372.78s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[04:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15375.22s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were President. [[04:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15377.380000000001s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[04:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15381.86s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[04:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15388.54s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that you can blame [[04:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15392.1s)]
*  the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[04:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15399.06s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[04:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15401.74s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — if I were President, that [[04:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15403.580000000002s)]
*  war would have never taken place. [[04:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15407.740000000002s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[04:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15409.300000000001s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[04:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15411.300000000001s)]
*  Okay? [[04:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15415.62s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15416.62s)]
*  I really am. [[04:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15417.62s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[04:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15418.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15419.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15420.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15421.62s)]
*  He's never said it. [[04:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15423.220000000001s)]
*  Have you said that Europeans are parasites? [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15425.5s)]
*  Have you said it? [[04:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15429.0s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. [[04:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15430.0s)]
*  I don't know what you're saying. [[04:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15431.0s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15432.0s)]
*  I'm trying to figure it out. [[04:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15433.980000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to figure it out. [[04:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15436.980000000001s)]

*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. Europe has gone through a lot of [[04:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15461.9s)]
*  problems and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. And I'm not a big fan [[04:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15490.5s)]
*  of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. And I think they [[04:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15495.42s)]
*  gotta get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15500.22s)]
*  with immigration. Now, I'll say this that the prime minister has taken a [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15505.2s)]
*  very tough stand on immigration. And I commented to her before I said, I wish [[04:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15508.94s)]
*  more people would be like you having to do with that subject, but they're not [[04:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15515.3s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. I want [[04:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15520.58s)]
*  Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[04:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15524.62s)]
*  But we are beginning to it doing it. You've seen you will see now the [[04:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15529.5s)]
*  policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15534.06s)]
*  have been changing. Okay, at the beginning we were talking all only [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15538.06s)]
*  about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. Now [[04:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15541.22s)]
*  we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the [[04:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15546.74s)]
*  countries of origin and transit and to return people. The European Commission [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15551.46s)]
*  just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. So [[04:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15557.02s)]
*  things are changing. Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in [[04:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15562.14s)]
*  lowering lowering the rates of illegal migration. So they we are working now [[04:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15567.86s)]
*  together. So I'm optimistic on that. [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15574.02s)]
*  The Google what? [[04:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15596.1s)]

*  will be? [[04:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15598.94s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about about the starling with this. We've been [[04:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15603.140000000001s)]
*  discussing about defense space where we will work together also in the Mars [[04:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15607.5s)]
*  missions. So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss [[04:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15613.9s)]
*  it. [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15619.140000000001s)]
*  I minister that changed your mind potentially about terrorists and what [[04:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15625.140000000001s)]
*  you can do going forward. No, no, tariffs are making us rich. We were [[04:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15628.66s)]
*  losing a lot of money under Biden, trillions of dollars, trillions on [[04:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15636.359999999999s)]
*  trade. And now that's that whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of [[04:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15641.14s)]
*  money. We're taking a lot of money. Don't forget we're taking in 25% on [[04:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15647.06s)]
*  cars, 25% on steel, 25% of aluminum, 10% baseline. We put penalties on [[04:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15650.939999999999s)]
*  China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25% [[04:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15658.38s)]
*  for for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[04:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15664.64s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here [[04:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15671.339999999998s)]
*  and talk to you. And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other [[04:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15674.619999999999s)]
*  than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs that [[04:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15679.98s)]
*  I put on China, where we took in up until this point, probably $700 billion. [[04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15683.94s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did everything he [[04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15689.619999999999s)]
*  could. You know, he got paid money by China, right? Family got paid money. He [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15693.82s)]
*  did. And so I don't know. Maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. But he [[04:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15697.619999999999s)]
*  tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because it was so much money that his [[04:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15703.46s)]
*  budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. But I took in in the [[04:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15706.26s)]
*  up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[04:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15713.98s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. I took in more than $700 billion from [[04:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15719.5s)]
*  China. So we're we're doing very well. I mean, our country is doing very well. [[04:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15724.26s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an [[04:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15729.9s)]
*  impact on the stock market. But this is about that. This is really we're [[04:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15735.539999999999s)]
*  building a country like no other. And again, I think I had the strongest [[04:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15740.699999999999s)]
*  economy in the history of our country by far, history of any country, probably, [[04:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15744.699999999999s)]
*  but the history of our country in four years. And I think this has a chance to [[04:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15748.86s)]
*  be much better. [[04:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15753.14s)]
*  What do you think? [[04:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15757.42s)]
*  Will that be signed here at the White House with Ukraine on Thursday? I don't [[04:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15759.42s)]
*  know exactly. I'm gonna leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it [[04:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15764.66s)]
*  be signed and when? [[04:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15767.82s)]
*  The details were shooting for around April 26. Is there any more detail that [[04:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15770.3s)]
*  you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15774.18s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. [[04:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15777.74s)]
*  We had a numbering of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and the [[04:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15783.82s)]
*  I think it's an 80 K agreement. And that's what will be signed. [[04:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15789.66s)]
*  President from one rate cuts. [[04:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15792.699999999999s)]
*  Clarify. [[04:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15795.699999999999s)]
*  On rate cuts, do you intend to see how firing and he doesn't change the [[04:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15797.699999999999s)]
*  stand on rate cuts or that on the table? Well, I think he should do the rate [[04:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15802.82s)]
*  cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage here. [[04:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15807.46s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. So I think you should do the rate [[04:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15812.9s)]
*  cuts. We don't have really inflation now. I just said the major things are [[04:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15817.259999999998s)]
*  going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of schedule, and that's because [[04:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15821.78s)]
*  of our policies. But oil is down into the $60 $65 range now per barrel. [[04:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15827.380000000001s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline and [[04:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15835.18s)]
*  food is down. Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[04:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15841.78s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. Interest rates are pretty flat. [[04:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15847.460000000001s)]
*  Not. It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. We should. [[04:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15851.02s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think would have a good impact on that [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15854.94s)]
*  too. But the costs are down. We have very little inflation. I would say we [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15858.62s)]
*  have essentially no inflation. Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and [[04:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15863.02s)]
*  oil goes down. When when Biden came in, oil went through the roof. That's what [[04:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15867.02s)]
*  caused our problem that and is very dumb spending. But when the oil prices [[04:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15871.7s)]
*  go down and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. We've [[04:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15877.94s)]
*  opened it up and we've gotten him down. And that means that people driving cars [[04:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15882.26s)]
*  are going to be paying $2.02 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. And, you know, even at [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15886.86s)]
*  the end, they tried, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it [[04:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15893.42s)]
*  down, but they had really lost that sucker. That was really it was not good. [[04:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15896.94s)]
*  But if they had won oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy, [[04:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15903.18s)]
*  and we're going to be at about $2 could be even a little bit less than that. And [[04:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15910.5s)]
*  you're starting to see it. So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil [[04:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15915.22s)]
*  is has come down quite a bit and and I would say the Fed really owes it to the [[04:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15918.98s)]
*  American people to get interest rates down. That's the only thing he's good [[04:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15926.46s)]
*  for. And he would have an effect on that if he if he if he lowered him. And [[04:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15929.5s)]
*  I think at some point he will. He's gonna have a lot of political pressure. [[04:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15935.04s)]
*  You know, they are political also. And I think there's a lot of political [[04:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15938.34s)]
*  pressure for him to lower interest rates. Okay, [[04:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15943.18s)]
*  yeah, go ahead. Please. [[04:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15949.94s)]
*  You think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe and also clear our [[04:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15952.1s)]
*  notice when we want to use that finance? Only if the prime minister remains the [[04:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15955.539999999999s)]
*  prime minister, can it be our best. She's she's doing now she's doing a great job. [[04:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15960.74s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe anywhere. [[04:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15965.94s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. And our relationship is is [[04:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=15971.5s)]

*  is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like to erase our [[04:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16110.18s)]
*  history. And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal [[04:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16117.1s)]
*  migration on fighting against synthetic drugs. You know, Italy has been one of [[04:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16123.939999999999s)]
*  the nation that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. But we have been [[04:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16130.22s)]
*  talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about [[04:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16136.619999999999s)]
*  defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. Italy will [[04:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16144.66s)]

*  develop. I think there can be ways to work together and the Italian [[04:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16161.939999999999s)]

*  about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. The exchange between us is a [[04:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16185.140000000001s)]

*  know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about such a [[04:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16209.42s)]
*  geographical space. I speak about the civilization. And I want to make that [[04:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16214.1s)]

*  and the killing to stop. [[04:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16354.06s)]
*  So, [[04:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16355.98s)]
*  how you said that determination of how to not come fast enough, he says he [[04:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16357.779999999999s)]
*  won't leave it even if you ask him to. Oh, he'll leave. If I asked him to, [[04:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16362.58s)]
*  he'll be out of there. But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think [[04:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16366.5s)]
*  he's doing the job. He's too late, always too late, little slow, and I'm [[04:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16371.099999999999s)]

*  Question. [[04:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16391.66s)]
*  Well, you're gonna have to speak to the lawyers. We have great lawyers. [[04:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16403.66s)]
*  I can tell you this. We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out [[04:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16406.9s)]
*  of this country who Biden allowed into the country, hundreds of thousands of [[04:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16411.02s)]
*  criminals, murderers and drug dealers. And I was elected because of the fact. [[04:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16416.06s)]
*  I would say maybe that was the number one factor. A lot of reasons. The [[04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16422.94s)]
*  economy, a lot of things. But one of the primary reasons I was elected is [[04:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16425.78s)]
*  because I said, I'm gonna get the criminals that he allowed to come into [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16429.86s)]
*  our country so stupidly through open borders. I'm gonna get him out. And [[04:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16433.38s)]
*  I got a lot of votes record setting numbers of votes. As you know, we want [[04:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16440.02s)]
*  everything. The popular vote, all seven swing states. We want everything. And [[04:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16443.7s)]
*  that's what the public wanted. That's what I'm doing. But you have to speak [[04:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16449.260000000002s)]
*  to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[04:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16452.66s)]
*  Say it. [[04:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16456.66s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and UK about peace mission? [[04:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16457.699999999997s)]
*  You're in Ukraine with soldiers. And you think that Italy should take [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16462.1s)]
*  parties? [[04:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16465.3s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. But peace missions [[04:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16467.3s)]
*  are always good with me. I'm okay with peace missions. Yeah, please. [[04:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16471.219999999998s)]
*  What is the cooperation discussed with the prime minister? [[04:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16476.3s)]
*  Is it Italy everybody stays in Europe? [[04:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16479.94s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. No, we're doing very well with negotiations, I [[04:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16484.219999999998s)]
*  think, with all countries. And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are [[04:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16488.379999999997s)]
*  doing very well. We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16494.14s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. Go ahead, Scott. Would you [[04:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16497.98s)]
*  say something? [[04:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16501.14s)]
*  We're working on [[04:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16503.739999999998s)]
*  we had [[04:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16507.539999999997s)]
*  yesterday. I believe there's been called with the EU already. And then we [[04:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16510.14s)]
*  have South Korea coming in next week. And I believe India is also talking [[04:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16515.059999999998s)]
*  that's moving very quickly. [[04:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16522.02s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16526.62s)]
*  China is supplying weaponry or ammunition. So brush. Do you have any [[04:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16530.02s)]
*  evidence on those? Like also, he said we could see a middle steel site this [[04:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16535.26s)]
*  well. We have a minerals deal which I guess is going to be signed on [[04:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16539.94s)]
*  Thursday, Scott. Next Thursday soon. And I assume they're gonna live up to the [[04:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16542.86s)]
*  deal. So we'll see. But we have a deal on that. [[04:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16548.66s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. I have no idea. That's his statement. Not mine. [[04:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16553.34s)]
*  President. [[04:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16558.22s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? You waved off Israeli plans to attack [[04:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16566.62s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran [[04:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16573.38s)]
*  has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death. And [[04:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16578.02s)]
*  I'd like to see that. That's my first option. [[04:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16584.3s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[04:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16587.9s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[04:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16593.14s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. It's gonna be very good for them if they do. [[04:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16597.44s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran be thrive in the future. Do fantastically well. I [[04:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16600.62s)]
*  know the Iranian people. They're incredible people always have been very [[04:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16606.7s)]
*  smart, very energetic, very successful people. And I don't want to do anything [[04:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16610.46s)]
*  that's gonna hurt anybody. I really don't. But Iran can't have a nuclear [[04:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16616.82s)]
*  weapon. It's pretty simple. It's really simple. We're not looking to take their [[04:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16621.260000000002s)]
*  industry. We're not looking to take their land. We're not always saying is [[04:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16627.100000000002s)]
*  we can't have a nuclear weapon. The deal that was made the deal that was made [[04:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16631.66s)]
*  with Obama, that deal would have expired already. It was a terrible deal. It [[04:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16636.78s)]
*  would have expired. And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. I [[04:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16641.94s)]
*  wouldn't have accepted this. Why I terminated the deal. Number one, it was [[04:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16646.94s)]
*  way too short. You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short term [[04:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16649.899999999998s)]
*  deals. These are countries with long lives. And I terminated that. And it was [[04:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16654.86s)]
*  a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. Once it [[04:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16661.14s)]
*  terminated, you know what the deal was. It was a terrible deal. Really one of [[04:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16664.539999999997s)]
*  many terrible deals made by the U. S. But no, I want I'd like to see Iran [[04:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16668.86s)]
*  thrive. [[04:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16674.940000000002s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily, or they can do it the other way. [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16676.66s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. Gonna be really bad for them. [[04:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16681.66s)]
*  Okay, [[04:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16686.06s)]
*  right. [[04:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16688.260000000002s)]

*  truth is. But I will say this, you know, where we were inundated by millions of [[04:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16727.66s)]
*  people, many millions of people during the Biden administration, they say 21 [[04:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16734.5s)]

*  done far greater than what I said. I mean, I got elected on that, but we've [[04:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16776.68s)]
*  done much better. We have right now 99% border. It's a 99%. Nobody thought that [[04:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16780.6s)]

*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through all for medical reasons. We [[04:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16790.5s)]
*  allowed them. We brought them through because one had a heart attack. One had [[04:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16793.879999999997s)]
*  something else all for medical reasons. We have a great border. We had a great [[04:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16797.719999999998s)]

*  people that were in jail for horrible. You know, they released jails Georgia [[04:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16817.44s)]

*  know what that is, but they came from the Congo and all over the world. They [[04:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16831.88s)]
*  came in, opened their jails Venezuela. Practically all of their prisoners [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16836.56s)]

*  And I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. But we have [[04:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16852.920000000002s)]
*  activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16858.02s)]

*  mental institutions. They want them to stay in our country. I guess. I don't [[04:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16867.26s)]
*  know. Maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays, the [[04:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16870.84s)]
*  progressive way. But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. And [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16874.539999999997s)]
*  that's why I wanted a landslide. [[04:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16878.96s)]
*  You did say that you were confident these deals will be done. But you also [[04:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16885.519999999997s)]
*  said that you're a no brush. Americans are seeing prices rise or singing on [[04:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16888.679999999997s)]

*  better because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you [[04:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16899.4s)]
*  very well. [[04:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16903.32s)]

*  Easter, everybody. You want to have eggs for Easter? And we did an [[04:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16955.52s)]
*  unbelievable job and now eggs of all over the place and the price went down [[04:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16959.68s)]
*  92% and our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job that [[04:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16963.800000000003s)]
*  really had done a fair so prices ever gonna. The only thing that's gone up [[04:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16972.04s)]
*  actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that is [[04:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16976.0s)]
*  playing politics. Somebody that I've never been very fond of actually, but [[04:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16981.32s)]
*  he's playing politics. Interest rates should be down now. They should be [[04:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16986.780000000002s)]
*  coming down in Europe. As you know, they reduced him I guess seven times. It [[04:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16991.0s)]
*  looks like they're gonna reduce him again and again and again. But our guy [[04:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=16996.8s)]
*  wants to play cute. But interest rates are pretty much even. Maybe they went up [[04:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17000.44s)]
*  just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. But that's because of the federal [[04:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17007.079999999998s)]
*  reserve because they're not very smart people. [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17010.12s)]

*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of [[04:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17023.92s)]
*  our country. Stock market went up 88 points. I think he's terrible, but I [[04:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17028.04s)]
*  can't complain because we had the most successful administration economically [[04:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17033.68s)]
*  in the history of our country. I think we're gonna do even better this time [[04:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17037.46s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that were taken in our astronomical [[04:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17041.760000000002s)]
*  were taken in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. We were treated [[04:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17046.74s)]
*  very unfairly on trade and the countries are having a hard time getting [[04:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17050.74s)]
*  used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real [[04:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17056.24s)]
*  president. We have a president that understands what it's all about. We had [[04:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17059.84s)]
*  presidents that in some cases were smart, but they didn't understand business [[04:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17064.52s)]
*  or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. Then [[04:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17070.24s)]
*  you had like the last administration. The only thing they were good at was [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17074.36s)]
*  cheating in elections. That's about all they could do. They couldn't do [[04:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17077.4s)]
*  anything that we useless. They were incompetent. Worst administration in the [[04:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17079.96s)]
*  history of our country, worse than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[04:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17083.28s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. Joe Biden was. So, uh, [[04:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17088.68s)]
*  I think you're gonna see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. It's [[04:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17096.32s)]
*  happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal, and if they don't want [[04:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17099.879999999997s)]

*  even if we are aware that the defense is a particularly important issue at this time. [[04:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17169.52s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, [[04:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17174.52s)]
*  I think there was an invasion, [[04:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17177.52s)]
*  and the invader was the one who was responsible for the invasion. [[04:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17180.52s)]
*  I think that the war in Ukraine is a very important issue, [[04:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17185.52s)]
*  and I think that there was clearly an invasion, [[04:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17188.52s)]
*  and that the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, [[04:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17193.52s)]
*  but that is not what reveals the fact that together we want to work, [[04:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17198.52s)]
*  we are working to try to bring peace to Ukraine, which can be right and lasting. [[04:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17204.52s)]

*  well, actually we have... [[04:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17265.52s)]
*  No, and also you talked about the military spending, [[04:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17271.52s)]
*  and the raising of the military spending, [[04:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17276.52s)]

*  no, actually we didn't talk about the raise of military spending, [[04:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17283.52s)]
*  of course Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[04:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17287.52s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware of the fact that [[04:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17292.52s)]
*  it is very important to... [[04:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17295.52s)]

*  I will do that. [[04:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17300.52s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defense percentage [[04:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17301.52s)]
*  about the defense spending, and I said, yes, NATO, [[04:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17305.52s)]
*  and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[04:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17310.52s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[04:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17316.52s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[04:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17320.52s)]
*  and we see also the war that we are trying to do at the European level. [[04:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17325.52s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[04:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17329.52s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[04:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17334.52s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[04:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17339.52s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[04:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17343.52s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[04:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17346.52s)]
*  that have their beautiful terraces. [[04:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17349.52s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[04:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17351.52s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[04:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17353.52s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[04:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17355.52s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[04:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17360.52s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[04:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17363.52s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[04:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17369.52s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[04:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17370.52s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[04:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17371.52s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[04:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17373.52s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[04:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17374.52s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[04:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17376.52s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[04:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17378.52s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were President. [[04:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17379.52s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17383.52s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[04:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17390.52s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[04:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17392.52s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[04:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17399.52s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[04:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17402.52s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that... [[04:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17404.52s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. [[04:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17406.52s)]
*  If I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17408.52s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[04:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17410.52s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[04:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17412.52s)]
*  Okay? [[04:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17417.52s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[04:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17418.52s)]
*  I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[04:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17419.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17426.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17427.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17428.52s)]
*  The question is, are you sure about the definition of a parasite for Europeans? [[04:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17436.52s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[04:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17441.52s)]
*  That Europeans are parasites? [[04:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17443.52s)]
*  He's never said it. [[04:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17445.52s)]
*  Could you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17446.52s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[04:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17448.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[04:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17450.52s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[04:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17451.52s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. [[04:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17452.52s)]
*  He didn't say it. [[04:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17453.52s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[04:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17454.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[04:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17456.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17458.52s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[04:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17460.52s)]
*  Wait. [[04:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17461.52s)]
*  Next. [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17462.52s)]
*  Next. [[04:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17463.52s)]
*  Go. [[04:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17464.52s)]
*  You just said you want to make Europe great again, and we want to do it together. [[04:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17465.52s)]
*  Together, in the United West. [[04:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17470.52s)]
*  Sure. [[04:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17471.52s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to do that? [[04:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17472.52s)]
*  And are you looking to do it to counter China, who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17478.52s)]
*  What is the health of the story? [[04:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17486.52s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[04:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17488.52s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[04:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17490.52s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[04:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17495.52s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[04:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17500.52s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[04:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17507.52s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[04:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17513.52s)]
*  I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject, but they're not. [[04:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17515.52s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[04:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17521.52s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[04:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17523.52s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[04:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17525.52s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[04:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17527.52s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[04:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17530.52s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[04:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17532.52s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[04:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17540.52s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[04:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17547.52s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[04:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17556.52s)]
*  So things are changing. [[04:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17563.52s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[04:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17565.52s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[04:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17572.52s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[04:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17576.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[04:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17578.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[04:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17582.52s)]
*  I would like to ask, President Belloni, if you have discussed the option of starting here with Italy on satellite communications, and President Trump, if you want to see the Google company... [[04:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17585.52s)]
*  The Google what? [[04:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17597.52s)]
*  The Google company. [[04:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17599.52s)]
*  The Google business. [[04:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17601.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[04:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17603.52s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[04:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17605.52s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[04:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17608.52s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[04:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17612.52s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[04:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17616.52s)]
*  I'm just asking if you have any other views, Prime Minister, that changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you plan to do going forward? [[04:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17621.52s)]
*  No. [[04:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17631.52s)]
*  That changed your perspective? [[04:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17632.52s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[04:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17634.52s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[04:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17636.52s)]
*  Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[04:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17640.52s)]
*  And now that's that whole tide has turned. [[04:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17643.52s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[04:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17646.52s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[04:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17648.52s)]
*  Don't forget we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[04:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17649.52s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[04:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17658.52s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[04:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17661.52s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[04:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17672.52s)]
*  And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[04:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17678.52s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[04:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17690.52s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[04:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17692.52s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[04:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17693.52s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[04:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17695.52s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[04:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17697.52s)]
*  He did. [[04:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17698.52s)]
*  And so I don't know. [[04:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17699.52s)]
*  Maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[04:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17701.52s)]
*  But he tried to weaken that, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[04:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17703.52s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[04:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17712.52s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[04:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17720.52s)]
*  I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. [[04:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17722.52s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. [[04:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17725.52s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[04:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17729.52s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[04:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17731.52s)]
*  But this is about that. [[04:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17738.52s)]
*  This is really we're building a base. [[04:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17740.52s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17742.52s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, history of any country probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[04:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17744.52s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[04:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17753.52s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[04:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17756.52s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[04:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17766.52s)]
*  What do you think? [[04:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17767.52s)]
*  Where would it be signed and what? [[04:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17768.52s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[04:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17770.52s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 26th. [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17772.52s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[04:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17774.52s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. [[04:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17778.52s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[04:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17785.52s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an agreement. [[04:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17787.52s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[04:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17792.52s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[04:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17793.52s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[04:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17801.52s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[04:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17804.52s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[04:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17806.52s)]
*  I just said the major things are going to be the rate cuts. [[04:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17808.52s)]
*  We're going to have to do the rate cuts. [[04:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17812.52s)]
*  We're going to have to do the rate cuts. [[04:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17814.52s)]
*  We're going to have to do the rate cuts. [[04:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17816.52s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[04:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17818.52s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[04:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17820.52s)]
*  Oil is great. [[04:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17823.52s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[04:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17825.52s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[04:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17827.52s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[04:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17829.52s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[04:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17835.52s)]
*  And food is down. [[04:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17840.52s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[04:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17843.52s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything is down. [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17846.52s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[04:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17848.52s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[04:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17850.52s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[04:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17852.52s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[04:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17854.52s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[04:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17858.52s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[04:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17860.52s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[04:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17862.52s)]
*  It's hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[04:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17864.52s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[04:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17866.52s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[04:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17868.52s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[04:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17870.52s)]
*  That and his very dumb stuff. [[04:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17872.52s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[04:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17874.52s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. [[04:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17876.52s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[04:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17882.52s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.00 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[04:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17885.52s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[04:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17893.52s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[04:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17898.52s)]
*  That was really, it was not good. [[04:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17902.52s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7.00 or $8.00 because of their policy. [[04:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17904.52s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2.00. [[04:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17911.52s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[04:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17914.52s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[04:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17916.52s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[04:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17918.52s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[04:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17922.52s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[04:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17929.52s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[04:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17931.52s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[04:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17935.52s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[04:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17938.52s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[04:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17940.52s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[04:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17943.52s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[04:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17951.52s)]
*  Please. [[04:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17952.52s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe and also clear our notice when the war against the communists? [[04:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17953.52s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17959.52s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[04:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17964.52s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[04:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17967.52s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[04:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17973.52s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[04:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17976.52s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[04:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17979.52s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[04:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17982.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[04:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17986.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[04:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=17988.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[05:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18015.52s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee, active shooting. [[05:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18016.52s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[05:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18023.52s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[05:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18026.52s)]
*  It's a shame. [[05:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18029.52s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[05:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18030.52s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[05:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18031.52s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[05:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18035.52s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, [[05:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18038.52s)]
*  who's doing a fantastic job. [[05:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18044.52s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[05:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18047.52s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[05:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18052.52s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[05:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18055.52s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[05:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18058.52s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[05:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18060.52s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[05:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18066.52s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[05:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18067.52s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[05:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18071.52s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[05:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18076.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18077.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[05:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18079.52s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[05:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18081.52s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship that comes from Grifo. [[05:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18084.52s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. [[05:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18091.52s)]
*  And April 17 marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Christopher Colombo to make his trip. [[05:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18093.52s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[05:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18102.52s)]
*  which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like to erase our history. [[05:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18111.52s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[05:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18119.52s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[05:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18130.52s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about defense, [[05:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18136.52s)]
*  about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[05:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18146.52s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18153.52s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[05:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18163.52s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years, as you know, in the next years, I think around 10 billions. [[05:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18166.52s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[05:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18179.52s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[05:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18183.52s)]
*  It's not only about Italy. [[05:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18185.52s)]
*  It's about the entire Europe. [[05:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18187.52s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[05:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18190.52s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the week. [[05:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18196.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[05:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18203.52s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about such a graphical space. [[05:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18209.52s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[05:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18217.52s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[05:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18219.52s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[05:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18221.52s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[05:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18232.52s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[05:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18246.52s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[05:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18249.52s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[05:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18252.52s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18256.52s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy today as a very good situation despite the difficulties, a stable country, a reliable country. [[05:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18258.52s)]
*  One million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[05:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18272.52s)]
*  Great. [[05:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18276.52s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[05:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18277.52s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[05:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18279.52s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[05:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18285.52s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[05:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18289.52s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[05:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18293.52s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[05:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18295.52s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[05:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18297.52s)]
*  We support your efforts. [[05:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18299.52s)]
*  Good. [[05:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18301.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18302.52s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18303.52s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[05:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18309.52s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[05:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18311.52s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[05:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18312.52s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[05:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18317.52s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[05:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18321.52s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[05:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18322.52s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[05:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18326.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[05:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18327.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18328.52s)]
*  Any questions? [[05:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18329.52s)]
*  How much longer does Wagner-Kuhn have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before you put [[05:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18330.52s)]
*  secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18340.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[05:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18343.52s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week. [[05:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18345.52s)]
*  Very shortly, actually. [[05:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18349.52s)]
*  And we'll see. [[05:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18351.52s)]
*  But we want it to stop. [[05:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18352.52s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[05:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18354.52s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell cannot [[05:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18356.52s)]
*  come fast enough. [[05:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18362.52s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[05:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18363.52s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave if I ask him to. [[05:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18366.52s)]
*  He'll be out of there. [[05:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18368.52s)]
*  But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[05:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18369.52s)]
*  He's too late. [[05:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18374.52s)]
*  Always too late. [[05:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18375.52s)]
*  A little slow. [[05:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18376.52s)]
*  And I'm not happy with him. [[05:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18378.52s)]
*  I let him know it. [[05:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18381.52s)]
*  If I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. [[05:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18383.52s)]
*  Believe me. [[05:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18387.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18388.52s)]
*  Question. [[05:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18389.52s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[05:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18390.52s)]
*  Judge, if the case against your administration's constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience [[05:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18391.52s)]
*  of judicial order, do you agree with that statement? [[05:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18402.52s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[05:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18405.52s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[05:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18407.52s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[05:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18408.52s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into [[05:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18409.52s)]
*  the country. [[05:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18414.52s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[05:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18415.52s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. [[05:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18420.52s)]
*  A lot of reasons. [[05:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18426.52s)]
*  The economy, a lot of things. [[05:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18427.52s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said I'm going to get the criminals [[05:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18428.52s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[05:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18433.52s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[05:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18438.52s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[05:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18440.52s)]
*  We won everything. [[05:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18445.52s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[05:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18446.52s)]
*  We won everything. [[05:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18448.52s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted and that's what I'm doing. [[05:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18449.52s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[05:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18453.52s)]
*  Say it. [[05:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18456.52s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and UK about peace mission in Ukraine with [[05:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18457.52s)]
*  soldiers? [[05:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18464.52s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[05:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18465.52s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[05:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18468.52s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[05:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18471.52s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[05:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18473.52s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[05:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18474.52s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the foreign [[05:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18475.52s)]
*  minister? [[05:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18480.52s)]
*  Is it Italy, the United States, and Europe? [[05:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18481.52s)]
*  And China? [[05:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18483.52s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[05:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18485.52s)]
*  No, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[05:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18487.52s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[05:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18491.52s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[05:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18496.52s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[05:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18499.52s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[05:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18501.52s)]
*  Would you say something, please? [[05:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18502.52s)]
*  We've been a process in place. [[05:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18503.52s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[05:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18505.52s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[05:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18508.52s)]
*  I believe there's been a call with the EU already. [[05:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18512.52s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[05:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18515.52s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[05:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18518.52s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[05:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18522.52s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have any evidence that China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[05:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18525.52s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[05:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18535.52s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a military-steer attack this week. [[05:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18537.52s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, next Thursday. [[05:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18540.52s)]
*  Soon. [[05:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18546.52s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[05:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18548.52s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[05:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18551.52s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[05:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18554.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[05:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18556.52s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[05:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18557.52s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the NNG's being able to attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[05:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18559.52s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[05:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18565.52s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[05:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18566.52s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[05:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18568.52s)]
*  Then you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[05:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18570.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[05:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18574.52s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death. [[05:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18576.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[05:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18585.52s)]
*  That's my first option. [[05:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18587.52s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[05:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18589.52s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[05:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18594.52s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[05:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18598.52s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[05:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18600.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[05:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18602.52s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[05:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18607.52s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[05:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18610.52s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[05:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18615.52s)]
*  I really don't. [[05:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18619.52s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[05:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18620.52s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[05:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18623.52s)]
*  It's really simple. [[05:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18624.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[05:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18626.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[05:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18629.52s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[05:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18631.52s)]
*  The deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have expired already. [[05:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18635.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[05:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18641.52s)]
*  It would have expired. [[05:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18643.52s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[05:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18645.52s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[05:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18648.52s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[05:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18649.52s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[05:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18650.52s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[05:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18652.52s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[05:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18656.52s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[05:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18658.52s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[05:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18661.52s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[05:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18665.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[05:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18667.52s)]
*  Really. [[05:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18668.52s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[05:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18669.52s)]
*  But, no, I want, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[05:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18672.52s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[05:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18676.52s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[05:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18680.52s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[05:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18683.52s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[05:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18685.52s)]
*  The Press. [[05:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18687.52s)]
*  Why do you make up an idea of CEO going to China and that was your official letter? [[05:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18688.52s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[05:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18694.52s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[05:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18696.52s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[05:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18697.52s)]
*  He loves our country. [[05:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18702.52s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[05:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18703.52s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're holding you in contempt, will you take steps to return [[05:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18705.52s)]
*  Kilmar of Arrego Garcia to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[05:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18712.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[05:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18716.52s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[05:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18717.52s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[05:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18723.52s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[05:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18725.52s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we're, [[05:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18730.52s)]
*  we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[05:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18734.52s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[05:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18739.52s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[05:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18741.52s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminal because they came into the border illegally. [[05:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18746.52s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[05:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18749.52s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person and they're on the loose. [[05:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18753.52s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country [[05:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18758.52s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[05:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18763.52s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[05:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18766.52s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. Tom Holman, Kristi Noem. [[05:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18771.52s)]
*  We have done an amazing job. [[05:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18775.52s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[05:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18777.52s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[05:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18779.52s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[05:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18780.52s)]
*  We have right now 99 percent border. It's a 99 percent. [[05:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18783.52s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, nobody's coming through our border practically. [[05:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18787.52s)]
*  Two weeks ago we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[05:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18792.52s)]
*  We allowed them. We brought them through because one had a heart attack, [[05:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18795.52s)]
*  one had something else, all for medical reasons. [[05:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18799.52s)]
*  We have a great border. We had a great border four years ago, [[05:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18803.52s)]
*  but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[05:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18806.52s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[05:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18809.52s)]
*  And now we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[05:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18812.52s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible. [[05:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18818.52s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world [[05:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18821.52s)]
*  and released them, not just South America, all over the world. [[05:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18826.52s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[05:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18829.52s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[05:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18831.52s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[05:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18833.52s)]
*  And all over the world they came in, opened their jails. [[05:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18836.52s)]
*  Venezuela, practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[05:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18839.52s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration [[05:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18844.52s)]
*  called the Biden administration. [[05:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18848.52s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[05:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18851.52s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. [[05:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18854.52s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[05:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18859.52s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[05:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18864.52s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[05:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18870.52s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[05:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18872.52s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[05:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18877.52s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done, [[05:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18882.52s)]
*  but you also said that you're in no rush. [[05:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18889.52s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise, they're seeing it on their bills. [[05:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18891.52s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[05:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18894.52s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better, because if you were truthful, which you're not, [[05:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18898.52s)]
*  I know you very well, you have gasoline that hit. [[05:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18904.52s)]
*  In Dallas, 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[05:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18909.52s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[05:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18914.52s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[05:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18918.52s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[05:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18921.52s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[05:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18924.52s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week, and they started screaming at me, [[05:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18927.52s)]
*  I said, eggs have gone through the roof. I said, I just got here. [[05:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18930.52s)]
*  I was there for seven days, and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[05:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18933.52s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news, like you, you're fake. [[05:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18938.52s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[05:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18942.52s)]
*  I said, I've only been here, I just, this is my seventh day. [[05:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18946.52s)]
*  And they were right, they went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[05:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18950.52s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[05:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18953.52s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[05:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18956.52s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job, and now eggs are all over the place, [[05:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18959.52s)]
*  and the price went down 92 percent. [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18963.52s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[05:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18966.52s)]
*  They've really done a fantastic job. So prices have gone up. [[05:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18972.52s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[05:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18975.52s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[05:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18978.52s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[05:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18983.52s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[05:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18987.52s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down. [[05:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18990.52s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[05:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18993.52s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[05:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=18998.52s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[05:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19001.52s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[05:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19003.52s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[05:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19007.52s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[05:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19010.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir, please. [[05:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19015.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19019.52s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[05:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19025.52s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[05:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19030.52s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain, [[05:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19032.52s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[05:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19036.52s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[05:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19040.52s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[05:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19043.52s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[05:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19048.52s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[05:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19051.52s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore, [[05:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19054.52s)]
*  because we have a real president. [[05:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19060.52s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[05:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19062.52s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[05:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19066.52s)]
*  that they didn't understand business or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[05:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19070.52s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[05:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19075.52s)]
*  That's about all they could do. They couldn't do anything that were useless. They were incompetent. [[05:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19080.52s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[05:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19083.52s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[05:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19086.52s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. Joe Biden was. [[05:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19090.52s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[05:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19095.52s)]
*  It's happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19101.52s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them because that's what's going to happen. [[05:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19104.52s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. But we want to listen to everybody. [[05:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19108.52s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're listening and we're going to be very fair. [[05:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19112.52s)]
*  We're going to be very fair to people. But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[05:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19124.52s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19128.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19130.52s)]
*  A question to our Prime Minister. [[05:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19134.52s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. You're so lucky. [[05:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19137.52s)]
*  In Italian? [[05:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19140.52s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[05:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19141.52s)]
*  Okay. [[05:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19142.52s)]
*  I'm not sure they're doing it right. [[05:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19143.52s)]
*  President Trump has considered the Italian government responsible for the Ukraine war. [[05:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19145.52s)]
*  And then if you had talked about the Italian expenses, what are the maximum limits that he said Italy can reach? [[05:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19152.52s)]
*  We've talked about the maximum limits that Italy can reach. [[05:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19161.52s)]
*  We've talked about the fact that Italy is keeping up its commitments because it will reach the next NATO target with the 2% that was already planned, [[05:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19164.52s)]
*  which was signed by the previous governments because we're a serious nation, [[05:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19173.52s)]
*  but we haven't talked about how much this percentage will increase, [[05:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19178.52s)]
*  even if we're aware that the defense issue is a particularly important issue at this time. [[05:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19182.52s)]
*  As for the Ukraine war, as I think, I think there was an invasion, [[05:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19187.52s)]
*  and the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, [[05:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19194.52s)]
*  but that's not what reveals the fact that together we want to work, [[05:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19200.52s)]
*  and we're working to try to bring peace to Ukraine, which can be just and lasting. [[05:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19205.52s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we're making to share our work. [[05:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19211.52s)]
*  We've also shared our voice today. [[05:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19216.52s)]
*  President, could you please introduce us to the President of the United States? [[05:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19218.52s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... That was so beautiful. What the hell was that? [[05:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19221.52s)]
*  What did she say, please? [[05:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19228.52s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. It was beautifully presented, [[05:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19230.52s)]
*  but maybe I could hear what she said. [[05:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19234.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[05:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19238.52s)]
*  It was about... [[05:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19240.52s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[05:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19242.52s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[05:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19244.52s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. I want to hear what she said. [[05:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19245.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19250.52s)]
*  The President, Prime Minister Maloney was asked what she thinks about the fact [[05:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19253.52s)]
*  that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, [[05:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19257.52s)]
*  and Prime Minister Maloney answered, well, actually, we have... [[05:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19264.52s)]
*  No, and also, you talked about the military spending, [[05:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19273.52s)]
*  and the raising of the military spending, [[05:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19278.52s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that, [[05:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19281.52s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[05:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19285.52s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[05:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19289.52s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware of the fact [[05:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19293.52s)]
*  that it is very important to... [[05:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19296.52s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[05:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19300.52s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[05:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19301.52s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I will do that. [[05:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19302.52s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defense percentage about... [[05:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19303.52s)]
*  Because it's expanded spending. [[05:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19308.52s)]
*  Right, NATO. NATO. [[05:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19310.52s)]
*  Yes, NATO. [[05:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19311.52s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[05:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19312.52s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[05:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19318.52s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[05:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19322.52s)]
*  and we see also the work that we are trying to do at the European level. [[05:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19327.52s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[05:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19332.52s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[05:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19336.52s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[05:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19341.52s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[05:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19345.52s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[05:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19348.52s)]
*  and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[05:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19350.52s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[05:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19352.52s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[05:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19355.52s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[05:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19357.52s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[05:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19362.52s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[05:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19365.52s)]
*  I think it's a war. I know it's a war. [[05:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19371.52s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. It was never close to happening. [[05:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19373.52s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[05:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19376.52s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[05:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19378.52s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[05:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19380.52s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[05:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19381.52s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[05:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19385.52s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[05:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19392.52s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[05:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19395.52s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[05:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19401.52s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[05:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19405.52s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that, and everybody agrees to it, [[05:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19407.52s)]
*  if I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[05:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19410.52s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that [[05:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19412.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[05:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19416.52s)]
*  Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[05:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19419.52s)]
*  President, you have a question for President Putin. [[05:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19424.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. [[05:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19428.52s)]
*  President, you have discussed the Chinese government's role in the war against the Chinese. [[05:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19431.52s)]
*  Mr. President, are you sure about the definition of the parasite of Europeans? [[05:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19437.52s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[05:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19443.52s)]
*  That European parasites... [[05:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19445.52s)]
*  He's never said it. [[05:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19446.52s)]
*  Could you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[05:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19447.52s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[05:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19449.52s)]
*  Yes. [[05:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19451.52s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[05:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19452.52s)]
*  No. I haven't said it. I don't even know what you're talking about. [[05:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19453.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[05:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19457.52s)]
*  No, no. Wait. Next. Next. Go. [[05:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19461.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19465.52s)]
*  Prime Minister, you just said you want to make Europe great again. [[05:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19466.52s)]
*  And we want to do it together. Together. [[05:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19471.52s)]
*  Sure. [[05:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19473.52s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[05:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19474.52s)]
*  how are you going to do that? And are you looking to do it to counter China? [[05:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19478.52s)]
*  Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[05:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19483.52s)]
*  Where the hell will that destroy Europe? [[05:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19488.52s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[05:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19490.52s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[05:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19492.52s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[05:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19497.52s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[05:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19502.52s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[05:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19509.52s)]
*  And I commented to her before. I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[05:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19515.52s)]
*  But they're not. Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. [[05:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19521.52s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[05:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19527.52s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[05:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19532.52s)]
*  You've seen, you will see now the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[05:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19534.52s)]
*  Okay. At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[05:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19542.52s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, [[05:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19549.52s)]
*  and to return people. The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[05:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19556.52s)]
*  So things are changing. Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[05:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19565.52s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. So I'm optimistic on that. [[05:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19574.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[05:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19579.52s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romani, if you have discussed the option of starting here with Italy on civilized communications, [[05:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19584.52s)]
*  and President Trump, if you want to see the Google company, what about it? [[05:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19592.52s)]
*  The Google what? [[05:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19598.52s)]
*  The Google company. [[05:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19600.52s)]
*  What about it? [[05:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19601.52s)]
*  The Google business. [[05:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19602.52s)]
*  If you want to see it right now, is it really? [[05:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19603.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19605.52s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. We've been discussing about defense space. [[05:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19606.52s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[05:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19613.52s)]
*  I'm just saying that the other thing that changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you can do going forward. [[05:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19623.52s)]
*  No. [[05:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19633.52s)]
*  That changed your perspective. [[05:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19634.52s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. We were losing a lot of money under Biden. Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[05:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19636.52s)]
*  And now that's, that whole tide has turned. We're making a lot of money. We're taking in a lot of money. [[05:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19645.52s)]
*  Don't forget we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[05:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19651.52s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada. [[05:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19659.52s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[05:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19666.52s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[05:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19673.52s)]
*  And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[05:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19679.52s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[05:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19685.52s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them. He did everything he could. You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[05:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19692.52s)]
*  Family got paid money. He did. And so I don't know. Maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[05:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19699.52s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[05:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19705.52s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China, nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[05:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19713.52s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. [[05:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19722.52s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. I mean, our country is doing very well. [[05:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19728.52s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[05:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19733.52s)]
*  But this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other. [[05:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19740.52s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far, [[05:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19746.52s)]
*  history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[05:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19750.52s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[05:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19754.52s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be signed and what? [[05:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19767.52s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. [[05:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19781.52s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an agreement. [[05:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19787.52s)]
*  And that's what we'll be signing. [[05:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19794.52s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage here. [[05:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19796.52s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. So I think he should do the rate cuts. We don't have really inflation now. [[05:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19816.52s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. Oil is great. Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[05:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19822.52s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. But oil is down into the sixty dollar sixty five dollar range now per barrel. [[05:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19829.52s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than two dollars for gasoline and food is down. [[05:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19837.52s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[05:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19845.52s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. It's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat. [[05:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19851.52s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think would have a good impact on that too. [[05:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19856.52s)]
*  But the costs are down. We have very little inflation. I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[05:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19861.52s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[05:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19866.52s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. That and his very dumb spending. [[05:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19874.52s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. [[05:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19878.52s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[05:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19884.52s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying two dollars and two dollars and fifty cents instead of four dollars and fifty cents. [[05:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19887.52s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried. They tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[05:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19894.52s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. That was really, it was not good. [[05:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19900.52s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at seven or eight dollars because of their policy. [[05:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19905.52s)]
*  And we're going to be at about two dollars. Could be even a little bit less than that. [[05:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19912.52s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[05:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19917.52s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates. [[05:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19924.52s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[05:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19931.52s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[05:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19936.52s)]
*  You know, they are political also. And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[05:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19941.52s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Please. [[05:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19953.52s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[05:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19961.52s)]
*  She's doing a great job. And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[05:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19966.52s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. And our relationship is great. [[05:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19974.52s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country. I tell you. And they like Trump. And they voted for Trump. [[05:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19981.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you. [[05:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=19987.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[05:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20011.52s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee, active shooting. [[05:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20018.52s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. Fully briefed as to where we are right now. It's a shame. [[05:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20025.52s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. Horrible that things like this take place. [[05:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20032.52s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[05:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20036.52s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us. [[05:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20040.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[05:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20045.52s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[05:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20049.52s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. And I can't say that about many people. [[05:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20054.52s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[05:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20059.52s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[05:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20062.52s)]
*  And we talked about trade. We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[05:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20067.52s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[05:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20073.52s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. Thank you very much. [[05:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20078.52s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. Thank you for your warm welcome. [[05:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20081.52s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship that comes from very far. [[05:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20086.52s)]
*  You know today is April 17th. [[05:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20093.52s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[05:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20096.52s)]
*  And I say to remember our ancient ties, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[05:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20104.52s)]
*  which is the fight against the walk and the ideology that we like to erase our history. [[05:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20113.52s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[05:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20121.52s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[05:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20132.52s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[05:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20138.52s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[05:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20155.52s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together and the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20165.52s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billion. [[05:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20177.52s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[05:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20182.52s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[05:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20185.52s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[05:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20187.52s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[05:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20192.52s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in this week. [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20197.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[05:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20204.52s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[05:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20210.52s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[05:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20218.52s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[05:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20220.52s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[05:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20223.52s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider a possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[05:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20234.52s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[05:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20248.52s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[05:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20252.52s)]
*  We can. [[05:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20254.52s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[05:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20255.52s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[05:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20259.52s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has very good as a very good situation, despite the difficulties of stable country, reliable country, one million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[05:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20260.52s)]
*  Great. [[05:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20278.52s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[05:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20279.52s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[05:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20281.52s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[05:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20287.52s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[05:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20291.52s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close together. [[05:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20295.52s)]
*  We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. [[05:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20297.52s)]
*  We can build a just and lasting peace. [[05:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20299.52s)]
*  We support your efforts. [[05:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20301.52s)]
*  Good. [[05:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20303.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20304.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[05:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20305.52s)]
*  We're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[05:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20306.52s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[05:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20311.52s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[05:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20313.52s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian Ukrainian soldiers. [[05:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20314.52s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[05:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20319.52s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[05:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20323.52s)]
*  I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[05:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20325.52s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[05:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20328.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[05:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20329.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20330.52s)]
*  Any questions? [[05:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20331.52s)]
*  How much longer does Wagner Putin have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before you put secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[05:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20332.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[05:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20345.52s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually. [[05:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20347.52s)]
*  And we'll see. [[05:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20353.52s)]
*  But we want it to stop. [[05:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20354.52s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[05:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20356.52s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell could not come fast enough. [[05:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20359.52s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[05:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20365.52s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. [[05:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20368.52s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. [[05:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20369.52s)]
*  But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[05:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20371.52s)]
*  He's too late. [[05:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20376.52s)]
*  Oh, it's too late. [[05:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20377.52s)]
*  It was slow. [[05:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20378.52s)]
*  And I'm not happy with him. [[05:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20380.52s)]
*  I let him know it. [[05:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20383.52s)]
*  And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. [[05:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20384.52s)]
*  Believe me. [[05:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20388.52s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[05:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20389.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20390.52s)]
*  Question. [[05:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20392.52s)]
*  Are you trying to remove him as a president? [[05:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20393.52s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[05:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20394.52s)]
*  Mr. President, would you like to change the vote for any kind of case against your administration so the Constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience of judicial order? [[05:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20395.52s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[05:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20405.52s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[05:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20406.52s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[05:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20408.52s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[05:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20410.52s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into the country. [[05:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20411.52s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[05:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20417.52s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. [[05:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20422.52s)]
*  A lot of reasons. [[05:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20428.52s)]
*  The economy, a lot of things. [[05:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20429.52s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[05:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20430.52s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[05:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20440.52s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. [[05:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20441.52s)]
*  As you know, we want everything. [[05:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20446.52s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[05:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20447.52s)]
*  We want everything. [[05:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20450.52s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted. [[05:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20451.52s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[05:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20453.52s)]
*  But you have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[05:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20455.52s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and the UK about peace mission in Ukraine with soldiers? [[05:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20458.52s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[05:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20467.52s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[05:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20470.52s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[05:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20473.52s)]
*  I'm OK with peace missions. [[05:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20475.52s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[05:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20476.52s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the Prime Minister? [[05:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20478.52s)]
*  Is it Italy and the United States and Europe? [[05:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20483.52s)]
*  And China? [[05:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20486.52s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[05:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20487.52s)]
*  No, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[05:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20489.52s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[05:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20493.52s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[05:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20498.52s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[05:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20501.52s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[05:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20503.52s)]
*  Would you say something? [[05:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20504.52s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[05:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20505.52s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[05:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20507.52s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[05:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20510.52s)]
*  I believe it has been called with the EU already. [[05:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20514.52s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[05:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20517.52s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[05:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20520.52s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[05:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20524.52s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think that Ukraine's President Zelensky is a U.S. evidence of China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[05:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20527.52s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[05:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20537.52s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a mineral field side this week. [[05:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20539.52s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, and next Thursday soon. [[05:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20543.52s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. [[05:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20549.52s)]
*  So we'll see. [[05:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20552.52s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[05:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20553.52s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[05:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20556.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[05:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20558.52s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[05:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20559.52s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the? [[05:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20561.52s)]
*  The Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[05:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20564.52s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[05:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20567.52s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[05:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20568.52s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[05:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20569.52s)]
*  Then you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[05:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20571.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[05:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20576.52s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and to live happily without death. [[05:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20577.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[05:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20587.52s)]
*  That's my first option. [[05:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20588.52s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[05:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20591.52s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[05:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20596.52s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[05:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20600.52s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[05:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20602.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[05:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20604.52s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[05:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20609.52s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[05:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20612.52s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[05:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20617.52s)]
*  I really don't. [[05:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20621.52s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[05:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20622.52s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[05:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20625.52s)]
*  It's really simple. [[05:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20626.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[05:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20628.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[05:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20631.52s)]
*  We're not. [[05:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20633.52s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[05:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20634.52s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have expired already. [[05:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20637.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[05:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20643.52s)]
*  It would have expired. [[05:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20644.52s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[05:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20647.52s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[05:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20650.52s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[05:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20651.52s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[05:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20652.52s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[05:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20654.52s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[05:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20658.52s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[05:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20661.52s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[05:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20664.52s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[05:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20667.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[05:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20669.52s)]
*  Really. [[05:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20670.52s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[05:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20671.52s)]
*  But no, I want, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[05:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20675.52s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[05:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20680.52s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[05:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20682.52s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[05:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20684.52s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[05:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20686.52s)]
*  The Press. [[05:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20688.52s)]
*  Why do you make up with the video CEO going to China and not with your officials there? [[05:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20690.52s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[05:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20695.52s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[05:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20697.52s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[05:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20699.52s)]
*  He loves our country. [[05:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20703.52s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[05:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20704.52s)]
*  The Press. [[05:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20706.52s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're all too content, will you take steps to return Kilmar of Arieco Garcia [[05:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20708.52s)]
*  to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[05:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20715.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[05:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20717.52s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[05:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20719.52s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[05:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20724.52s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[05:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20727.52s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we're, we were inundated by millions of people. [[05:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20732.52s)]
*  Many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[05:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20737.52s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[05:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20740.52s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[05:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20742.52s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminal because they came into the border illegally. [[05:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20747.52s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[05:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20750.52s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[05:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20754.52s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals to get them out of our country [[05:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20759.52s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[05:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20764.52s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[05:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20767.52s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[05:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20772.52s)]
*  Tom Hulman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[05:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20774.52s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[05:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20778.52s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[05:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20780.52s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[05:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20782.52s)]
*  We have right now 99 percent border. [[05:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20784.52s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[05:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20787.52s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, nobody's coming through our border practically. [[05:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20788.52s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[05:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20793.52s)]
*  We allowed them. [[05:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20797.52s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[05:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20798.52s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[05:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20802.52s)]
*  We have a great border. [[05:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20804.52s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20806.52s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[05:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20811.52s)]
*  And, you know, we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[05:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20813.52s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible. [[05:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20820.52s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world and released them, [[05:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20823.52s)]
*  not just South America, all over the world. [[05:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20829.52s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[05:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20831.52s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[05:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20833.52s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20835.52s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails. [[05:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20838.52s)]
*  Venezuela, practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[05:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20841.52s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration [[05:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20846.52s)]
*  and to think what they've done to our country. [[05:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20852.52s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[05:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20856.52s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[05:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20859.52s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[05:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20861.52s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[05:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20866.52s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[05:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20872.52s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[05:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20874.52s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[05:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20879.52s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[05:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20882.52s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done. [[05:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20884.52s)]
*  But you also said that you're in no rush. [[05:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20891.52s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[05:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20893.52s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[05:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20895.52s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[05:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20896.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[05:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20900.52s)]
*  They've already seen it get much better because if you were truthful, which you're not, [[05:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20901.52s)]
*  I know you very well, you have gasoline that hit. [[05:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20906.52s)]
*  In Allen 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[05:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20911.52s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[05:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20916.52s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[05:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20920.52s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[05:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20923.52s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[05:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20926.52s)]
*  I just got there. [[05:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20929.52s)]
*  I was here for one week and they started screaming at me, eggs have gone through the roof. [[05:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20930.52s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[05:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20934.52s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[05:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20935.52s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[05:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20941.52s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[05:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20945.52s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[05:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20949.52s)]
*  I just, this is my seventh day. [[05:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20950.52s)]
*  And they were right. [[05:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20953.52s)]
*  They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[05:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20954.52s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[05:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20956.52s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[05:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20958.52s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[05:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20960.52s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[05:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20962.52s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[05:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20964.52s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[05:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20969.52s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[05:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20975.52s)]
*  So prices have gone up. [[05:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20977.52s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates [[05:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20978.52s)]
*  because we have a federal reserve chairman that is playing politics, [[05:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20981.52s)]
*  somebody that I've never been very fond of actually. [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20986.52s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[05:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20989.52s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[05:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20992.52s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. [[05:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20993.52s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[05:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20996.52s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[05:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=20999.52s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[05:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21003.52s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[05:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21005.52s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[05:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21009.52s)]
*  But that's because of the federal reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[05:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21012.52s)]
*  Do you regret nominating him? [[05:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21017.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir, please. [[05:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21020.52s)]
*  Do you regret nominating him, Jerome Howe? [[05:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21022.52s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[05:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21027.52s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[05:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21032.52s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration [[05:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21035.52s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[05:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21040.52s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the numbers [[05:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21043.52s)]
*  that we're taking in are astronomical. [[05:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21048.52s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[05:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21050.52s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[05:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21053.52s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore [[05:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21056.52s)]
*  because we have a real president. [[05:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21062.52s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[05:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21064.52s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, but they didn't understand business [[05:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21068.52s)]
*  or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[05:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21073.52s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[05:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21077.52s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21082.52s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[05:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21083.52s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[05:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21085.52s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[05:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21086.52s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. [[05:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21089.52s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[05:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21090.52s)]
*  You know why? [[05:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21092.52s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[05:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21093.52s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[05:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21095.52s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[05:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21097.52s)]
*  It's happening now. [[05:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21102.52s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[05:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21103.52s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them [[05:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21105.52s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[05:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21108.52s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[05:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21110.52s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[05:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21112.52s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it [[05:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21114.52s)]
*  that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[05:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21122.52s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[05:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21127.52s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21130.52s)]
*  Okay? [[05:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21131.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21132.52s)]
*  Please. [[05:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21135.52s)]
*  A question to our Prime Minister. [[05:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21136.52s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[05:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21139.52s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[05:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21141.52s)]
*  Yes. [[05:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21142.52s)]
*  In Italian? [[05:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21143.52s)]
*  Yes, that's right. [[05:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21144.52s)]
*  Okay. [[05:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21145.52s)]
*  I'm not sure they do agree. [[05:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21146.52s)]
*  Presidente Veroni, lo socare, cosa pensavo del fatto che Presidente Trump [[05:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21147.52s)]
*  ha considerato responsabile zieleschi della Corte Ucraina. [[05:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21151.52s)]
*  E poi se avete parlato delle spese militare, [[05:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21154.52s)]
*  qual è il limite massimo a cui ha detto [[05:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21157.52s)]
*  che può arrivare l'Italia, le percentuali delle spese militare? [[05:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21160.52s)]
*  Abbiamo parlato del limite massimo a cui può arrivare l'Italia. [[05:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21163.52s)]
*  Abbiamo parlato del fatto che l'Italia sta mantenendo i suoi impegni [[05:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21165.52s)]
*  perché arriverà al prossimo vertice della NATO, [[05:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21169.52s)]
*  con il 2%, che era già previsto, [[05:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21172.52s)]
*  che è stato sottoscritto dai governi precedenti [[05:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21175.52s)]
*  perché siamo una nazione seria, [[05:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21177.52s)]
*  ma non abbiamo parlato di quanto vada aumentata questa percentuale, [[05:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21179.52s)]
*  anche se siamo consapevoli che il tema della difesa [[05:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21183.52s)]
*  sia un tema particolarmente importante di questo tempo. [[05:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21186.52s)]
*  Per quello che riguarda la guerra in Ucraina, [[05:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21189.52s)]
*  alle sa come la penso, [[05:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21190.52s)]
*  penso che ci sia chiaramente una... [[05:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21191.52s)]
*  diciamo, ci sia stata un'invasione [[05:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21194.52s)]
*  e che l'invasore da quel punto di vista fosse Putin e la Russia, [[05:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21196.52s)]
*  ma non è questo che oggi quello che rivela [[05:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21201.52s)]
*  il fatto che insieme vogliamo lavorare, [[05:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21205.52s)]
*  stiamo lavorando per cercare di arrivare in Ucraina [[05:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21207.52s)]
*  a una pace che possa essere giusta e duratura. [[05:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21210.52s)]
*  Penso che questi siano gli sforzi sui quali condividiamo il nostro lavoro, [[05:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21213.52s)]
*  abbiamo condiviso anche oggi il nostro lavoro. [[05:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21217.52s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... [[05:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21224.52s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[05:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21226.52s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[05:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21228.52s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[05:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21229.52s)]
*  No, I mean it sounded great. [[05:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21231.52s)]
*  It was about... [[05:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21233.52s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[05:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21234.52s)]
*  Maybe I could hear what she said. [[05:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21236.52s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[05:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21239.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[05:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21241.52s)]
*  It was about asking... [[05:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21242.52s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[05:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21244.52s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[05:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21245.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[05:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21246.52s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[05:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21247.52s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[05:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21249.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[05:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21251.52s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Malone was asked whether... [[05:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21253.52s)]
*  what she thinks about the fact that President Trump [[05:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21257.52s)]
*  holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine [[05:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21260.52s)]
*  and Prime Minister Malone answered, [[05:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21265.52s)]
*  well, actually, we have... [[05:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21268.52s)]
*  No, and also, you talked about the military spending [[05:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21275.52s)]
*  and the raising of the military spending. [[05:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21280.52s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is that, [[05:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21282.52s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[05:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21287.52s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[05:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21291.52s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware [[05:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21295.52s)]
*  of the fact that it is very important to... [[05:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21298.52s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[05:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21302.52s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[05:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21303.52s)]
*  I will do that. [[05:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21304.52s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defensive percentage [[05:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21305.52s)]
*  about the defense spending. [[05:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21309.52s)]
*  Right, NATO. [[05:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21312.52s)]
*  Yes, NATO. [[05:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21313.52s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent [[05:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21314.52s)]
*  as it was already decided. [[05:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21317.52s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[05:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21319.52s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important [[05:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21323.52s)]
*  for the future, and we see also the war [[05:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21327.52s)]
*  that we are trying to do at the European level. [[05:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21330.52s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[05:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21333.52s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[05:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21337.52s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[05:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21343.52s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[05:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21347.52s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[05:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21350.52s)]
*  and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[05:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21352.52s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[05:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21354.52s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[05:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21357.52s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground [[05:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21359.52s)]
*  in a million pieces, getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[05:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21362.52s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, [[05:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21367.52s)]
*  and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[05:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21370.52s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[05:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21373.52s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[05:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21374.52s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[05:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21375.52s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[05:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21376.52s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[05:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21377.52s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[05:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21379.52s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[05:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21381.52s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were President. [[05:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21383.52s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, [[05:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21386.52s)]
*  because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[05:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21389.52s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[05:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21393.52s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars. [[05:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21396.52s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat [[05:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21402.52s)]
*  Biden. He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[05:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21405.52s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that, and everybody agrees to it, [[05:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21408.52s)]
*  if I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[05:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21411.52s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[05:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21414.52s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[05:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21415.52s)]
*  Okay? [[05:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21420.52s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[05:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21421.52s)]
*  I really am. [[05:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21422.52s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[05:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21423.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[05:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21424.52s)]
*  President, go ahead. [[05:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21425.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[05:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21427.52s)]

*  Go ahead. [[05:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21429.52s)]
*  Are you sure about the definition of a parasite for Europeans? [[05:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21430.52s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[05:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21433.52s)]
*  That European parasites... [[05:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21435.52s)]
*  He's never said it. [[05:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21436.52s)]
*  Could you say that again? [[05:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21437.52s)]
*  The Europeans... [[05:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21438.52s)]
*  Have you said that the Europeans are parasites? [[05:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21439.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[05:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21441.52s)]
*  Have you said it? [[05:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21442.52s)]
*  No. [[05:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21443.52s)]
*  I haven't said it. [[05:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21444.52s)]
*  I don't know what you... [[05:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21445.52s)]
*  He didn't say it. [[05:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21446.52s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[05:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21447.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[05:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21448.52s)]

*  And she's become a friend. [[06:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21670.52s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[06:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21672.52s)]

*  that comes from Grifo. [[06:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21701.52s)]
*  You know today is April 17th, and April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that [[06:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21703.52s)]
*  allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[06:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21711.52s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share [[06:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21714.52s)]
*  another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like [[06:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21722.52s)]
*  to erase our history. [[06:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21729.52s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting [[06:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21731.52s)]
*  against synthetic drugs. [[06:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21740.52s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[06:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21742.52s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[06:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21749.52s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[06:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21756.52s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports. [[06:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21765.52s)]
*  And also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[06:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21773.52s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[06:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21776.52s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[06:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21779.52s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billions. [[06:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21788.52s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[06:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21792.52s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[06:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21796.52s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[06:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21798.52s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[06:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21802.52s)]
*  Investments, trade. [[06:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21807.52s)]
*  It's a topic that we are discussing in the next week. [[06:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21811.52s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western [[06:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21815.52s)]
*  nationalism. [[06:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21820.52s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[06:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21821.52s)]
*  I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about a geographical space. [[06:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21823.52s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[06:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21829.52s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[06:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21831.52s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the outland, take it as [[06:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21834.52s)]
*  the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[06:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21841.52s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official [[06:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21845.52s)]
*  visit to Rome in the near future and consider a possibility in that occasion to meet also [[06:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21851.52s)]
*  with Europe. [[06:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21857.52s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[06:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21859.52s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[06:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21862.52s)]
*  We can. [[06:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21864.52s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[06:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21866.52s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[06:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21869.52s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has [[06:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21871.52s)]
*  a very good situation despite the difficulties, a stable country, a reliable country, 1 million [[06:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21878.52s)]
*  more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[06:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21885.52s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[06:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21889.52s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand [[06:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21891.52s)]
*  me. [[06:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21897.52s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60%. [[06:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21898.52s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[06:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21901.52s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[06:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21905.52s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[06:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21907.52s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[06:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21909.52s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[06:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21911.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21913.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[06:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21915.52s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[06:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21917.52s)]
*  We want to save. [[06:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21921.52s)]
*  On average, think of it, every week 2,500 people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[06:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21923.52s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[06:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21929.52s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[06:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21933.52s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll let you know very soon. [[06:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21935.52s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[06:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21939.52s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[06:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21941.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[06:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21943.52s)]
*  Any questions? [[06:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21945.52s)]
*  How much longer does Wagner-Kuhn have to respond to your ceasefire proposal before you put [[06:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21947.52s)]
*  secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[06:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21953.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21957.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21959.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21961.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21963.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21965.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21967.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21969.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21971.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21973.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21975.52s)]

*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21981.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21983.52s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[06:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21985.52s)]
*  It's always too late, always too late, a little slow, and I'm not happy with him. [[06:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21987.52s)]
*  I let him know it, and if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast, believe me. [[06:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21993.52s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[06:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=21999.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[06:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22001.52s)]
*  Question. [[06:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22003.52s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[06:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22005.52s)]
*  I'm going to take Judge Moseburr, in kind of a case against your administration. [[06:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22007.52s)]
*  So the Constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience of judicial order. [[06:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22011.52s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[06:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22015.52s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[06:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22017.52s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[06:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22019.52s)]
*  I can tell you this, we're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country [[06:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22021.52s)]
*  who Biden allowed into the country. [[06:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22025.52s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers, and drug dealers. [[06:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22027.52s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, [[06:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22033.52s)]
*  I would say maybe that was the number one factor, a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[06:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22036.52s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, [[06:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22040.52s)]
*  I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[06:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22044.52s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[06:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22050.52s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[06:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22052.52s)]
*  We won everything. [[06:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22057.52s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states, we won everything. [[06:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22058.52s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted, and that's what I'm doing. [[06:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22061.52s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[06:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22065.52s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you think of the proposal from France and the UK of a peace mission in Ukraine with soldiers? [[06:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22068.52s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[06:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22077.52s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[06:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22080.52s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[06:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22083.52s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[06:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22086.52s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[06:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22087.52s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the foreign minister? [[06:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22088.52s)]
*  Italy, the United States, and Europe. [[06:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22093.52s)]
*  And China? [[06:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22096.52s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[06:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22097.52s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[06:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22099.52s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[06:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22103.52s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[06:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22108.52s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[06:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22111.52s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[06:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22113.52s)]
*  Would you say something? [[06:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22114.52s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[06:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22115.52s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[06:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22117.52s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[06:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22120.52s)]
*  I believe it's been called with the EU already. [[06:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22124.52s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[06:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22127.52s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[06:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22130.52s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[06:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22134.52s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have any evidence that the Ukraine's President Zelensky is a terrorist from China, [[06:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22137.52s)]
*  is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[06:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22143.52s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[06:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22148.52s)]
*  Also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[06:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22150.52s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, and next Thursday. [[06:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22153.52s)]
*  Soon. [[06:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22159.52s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[06:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22160.52s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[06:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22163.52s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[06:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22167.52s)]
*  I have no idea. [[06:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22168.52s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[06:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22169.52s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[06:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22171.52s)]
*  Did you comment on that? Is that accurate? [[06:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22177.52s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[06:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22179.52s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[06:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22181.52s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[06:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22186.52s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[06:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22188.52s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[06:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22193.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[06:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22197.52s)]
*  That's my first option. [[06:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22198.52s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[06:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22201.52s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[06:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22206.52s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[06:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22210.52s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[06:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22212.52s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[06:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22214.52s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[06:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22219.52s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[06:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22222.52s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[06:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22227.52s)]
*  I really don't. [[06:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22231.52s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[06:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22232.52s)]
*  It's pretty simple. It's really simple. [[06:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22235.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[06:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22238.52s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[06:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22241.52s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[06:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22244.52s)]
*  The deal that was made with Obama, that deal would have expired already. [[06:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22247.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. It would have expired. [[06:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22253.52s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[06:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22256.52s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. That's why I terminated the deal. [[06:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22260.52s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[06:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22262.52s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[06:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22264.52s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[06:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22268.52s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[06:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22270.52s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[06:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22273.52s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[06:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22277.52s)]
*  It was a terrible deal, really. [[06:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22279.52s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[06:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22281.52s)]
*  But, no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[06:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22285.52s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[06:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22289.52s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[06:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22293.52s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[06:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22295.52s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[06:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22297.52s)]
*  The Press. [[06:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22299.52s)]
*  Why do you make up an idea of CTO going to China and met with trade officials there? [[06:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22302.52s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[06:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22306.52s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[06:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22308.52s)]
*  I don't know. [[06:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22310.52s)]
*  He's a person that's very proud of our country. [[06:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22311.52s)]
*  He loves our country. [[06:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22314.52s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[06:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22315.52s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're holding you in contempt, will you take steps to return [[06:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22317.52s)]
*  Kilmar O'Reilly Garcia to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[06:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22324.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[06:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22328.52s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[06:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22329.52s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[06:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22335.52s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[06:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22337.52s)]
*  But I will say this. [[06:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22342.52s)]
*  We were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people, during the [[06:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22344.52s)]
*  Biden administration. [[06:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22350.52s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[06:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22351.52s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[06:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22353.52s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[06:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22358.52s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[06:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22361.52s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[06:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22365.52s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, [[06:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22370.52s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[06:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22374.52s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[06:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22378.52s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[06:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22382.52s)]
*  Tom Hulman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[06:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22384.52s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[06:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22388.52s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[06:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22390.52s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[06:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22392.52s)]
*  We have, right now, 99 percent border. [[06:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22394.52s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[06:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22397.52s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be possible. [[06:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22399.52s)]
*  Nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[06:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22400.52s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[06:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22403.52s)]
*  We allowed them. [[06:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22407.52s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[06:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22408.52s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[06:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22412.52s)]
*  We have a great border. [[06:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22415.52s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[06:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22416.52s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[06:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22421.52s)]
*  And, you know, we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[06:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22424.52s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible. [[06:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22430.52s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world, [[06:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22433.52s)]
*  and released them not just South America, all over the world. [[06:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22438.52s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[06:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22441.52s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[06:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22443.52s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[06:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22445.52s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails, Venezuela. [[06:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22448.52s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[06:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22453.52s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden Administration. [[06:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22456.52s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[06:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22462.52s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. [[06:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22465.52s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[06:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22470.52s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[06:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22476.52s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[06:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22482.52s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[06:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22484.52s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[06:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22490.52s)]
*  Mr. President, back to the stream. [[06:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22494.52s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done, [[06:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22496.52s)]
*  but you also said that you're a no-brush. [[06:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22501.52s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. [[06:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22503.52s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[06:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22506.52s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better. [[06:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22510.52s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, [[06:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22513.52s)]
*  you have gasoline that hit. [[06:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22518.52s)]
*  At Dowland 98 yesterday in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[06:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22521.52s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[06:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22526.52s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[06:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22530.52s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[06:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22533.52s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[06:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22536.52s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week, and they started screaming at me, [[06:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22539.52s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[06:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22542.52s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[06:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22544.52s)]
*  I was there for seven days, and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[06:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22546.52s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news, like you. You're fake. [[06:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22551.52s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[06:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22555.52s)]
*  I said, I've only been here, I just, this is my seventh day. [[06:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22559.52s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[06:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22562.52s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[06:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22566.52s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[06:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22569.52s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job, and now eggs are all over the place, [[06:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22572.52s)]
*  and the price went down 92 percent. [[06:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22576.52s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[06:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22579.52s)]
*  They've really done a fantastic job. [[06:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22585.52s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[06:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22587.52s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[06:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22588.52s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[06:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22591.52s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[06:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22596.52s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[06:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22600.52s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down. [[06:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22602.52s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[06:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22606.52s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[06:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22610.52s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[06:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22613.52s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[06:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22615.52s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[06:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22620.52s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[06:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22622.52s)]
*  Do you regret nominating him? [[06:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22627.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir. Please. [[06:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22630.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Please. [[06:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22632.52s)]
*  Do you regret nominating him, Jerome Howe? [[06:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22633.52s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[06:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22637.52s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[06:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22642.52s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain, [[06:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22645.52s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[06:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22648.52s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[06:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22653.52s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[06:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22655.52s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[06:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22660.52s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[06:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22663.52s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore, [[06:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22666.52s)]
*  because we have a real president. [[06:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22672.52s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[06:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22674.52s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, but they didn't understand business, [[06:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22678.52s)]
*  or they didn't like business, or it wasn't like a priority. [[06:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22684.52s)]
*  And then you had, like, the last administration. [[06:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22687.52s)]
*  The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[06:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22689.52s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[06:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22692.52s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. They were incompetent. [[06:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22693.52s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[06:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22695.52s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[06:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22698.52s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst president. [[06:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22702.52s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[06:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22706.52s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[06:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22708.52s)]
*  It's happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[06:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22713.52s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them. [[06:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22716.52s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[06:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22719.52s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[06:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22721.52s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[06:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22723.52s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it [[06:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22725.52s)]
*  that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[06:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22733.52s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal, and that's what we'll be doing. [[06:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22738.52s)]
*  Okay? [[06:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22742.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Please. [[06:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22744.52s)]
*  A question. Today, our Prime Minister... [[06:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22747.52s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. You're so lucky. Yes. [[06:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22750.52s)]
*  In Italian? [[06:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22753.52s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[06:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22754.52s)]
*  Okay. I'm not sure that would be... [[06:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22755.52s)]
*  Presidente Benoni, per lo socare, cosa pensavo del fatto che Presidente Trump [[06:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22757.52s)]
*  ha considerato responsabile Zelensky della Guardia Ucraina? [[06:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22762.52s)]
*  E poi se avete parlato delle spese militari, qual è il limite massimo a cui ha detto [[06:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22765.52s)]
*  di arrivare in Italia, le spese militari? [[06:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22771.52s)]
*  Abbiamo parlato del limite massimo a cui vuole arrivare in Italia. [[06:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22773.52s)]
*  Abbiamo parlato del fatto che l'Italia sta mantenendo i tuoi impegni [[06:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22776.52s)]
*  perché arriverà al prossimo vertice della NATO, con il 2%, che era già previsto, [[06:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22780.52s)]
*  che è stato sottoscritto dai governi precedenti, [[06:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22785.52s)]
*  perché siamo una nazione seria, ma non abbiamo parlato poi di quanto vada aumentata questa percentuale, [[06:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22788.52s)]
*  anche se siamo consapevoli che il tema della difesa sia un tema particolarmente importante di questo tempo. [[06:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22794.52s)]
*  Per quello che riguarda la guerra in Ucraina, lei sa come la penso, [[06:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22799.52s)]
*  penso che ci sia chiaramente una... diciamo ci sia stata un'invasione [[06:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22802.52s)]
*  e che l'invasore da quel punto di vista fosse Putin e la Russia, [[06:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22806.52s)]
*  ma non è questo che, diciamo, oggi quello che rivela il fatto che insieme vogliamo lavorare, [[06:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22812.52s)]
*  stiamo lavorando per cercare di arrivare in Ucraina a una pace che possa essere giusta e duratura. [[06:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22817.52s)]
*  Penso che questi siano gli sforzi sui quali condividiamo il nostro lavoro, [[06:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22823.52s)]
*  abbiamo condivido anche i nostri obiettivi. [[06:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22828.52s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... that was so beautiful. What the hell was that? [[06:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22834.52s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[06:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22840.52s)]
*  No, I mean it sounded great. It was beautifully presented, [[06:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22842.52s)]
*  but maybe I could hear what she said. Please, go ahead. [[06:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22846.52s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22851.52s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[06:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22854.52s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. I want to hear what she said. [[06:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22857.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[06:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22863.52s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Malone was asked whether, what she thinks about the fact that [[06:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22865.52s)]
*  President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, [[06:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22869.52s)]
*  and Prime Minister Malone answered, well, actually, we have... [[06:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22876.52s)]
*  and also you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending, [[06:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22884.52s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is, no, actually, we didn't talk about the raising military spending. [[06:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22893.52s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2%, and then we will see, [[06:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22902.52s)]
*  because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... defense is very important. [[06:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22907.52s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I will do that. They've been asking if we decided another defensive percentage [[06:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22914.52s)]
*  about the defense spending, and I said... Yes, NATO. [[06:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22919.52s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2% as it was already decided. [[06:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22924.52s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[06:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22930.52s)]
*  and we see also the war that we are trying to do at the European level. [[06:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22939.52s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[06:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22943.52s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were president. [[06:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22953.52s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[06:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22957.52s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[06:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22960.52s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[06:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22964.52s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[06:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22969.52s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[06:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22977.52s)]
*  I think it's a war. I know it's a war. It didn't happen for four years. [[06:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22983.52s)]
*  It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[06:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22987.52s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye. [[06:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22990.52s)]
*  But there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were president. [[06:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22994.52s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[06:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=22997.52s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[06:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23004.52s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[06:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23007.52s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[06:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23014.52s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. But I can guarantee you that... [[06:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23017.52s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. If I were president, that war would have never taken place. [[06:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23021.52s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[06:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23025.52s)]
*  Okay? I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[06:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23031.52s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. [[06:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23037.52s)]
*  Are you sure about the definition of a parasite for Europeans? [[06:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23044.52s)]
*  Could you say that again? That Europeans are parasites? [[06:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23056.52s)]
*  He's never said it. [[06:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23059.52s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[06:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23060.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[06:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23064.52s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[06:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23065.52s)]
*  He didn't say it. I don't even know what you're talking about. [[06:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23066.52s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[06:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23069.52s)]
*  No, no, wait. Wait. Next. Next. Next. Go. [[06:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23074.52s)]
*  Prime Minister Milley just said you want to make Europe great again, and we want to do it together. [[06:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23078.52s)]
*  Sure. [[06:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23085.52s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to do that? [[06:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23086.52s)]
*  Are you looking to do it to counter China, who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[06:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23092.52s)]
*  What the hell are those doing? [[06:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23101.52s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[06:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23103.52s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[06:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23105.52s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[06:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23110.52s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[06:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23115.52s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[06:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23121.52s)]
*  And I commented to her before. I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[06:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23127.52s)]
*  But they're not. Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. I want Europe to do very well. [[06:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23133.52s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[06:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23141.52s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[06:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23145.52s)]
*  Okay. At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[06:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23154.52s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries of origin and transit, and to return people. [[06:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23161.52s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[06:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23170.52s)]
*  So things are changing. Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[06:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23177.52s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. So I'm optimistic on that. [[06:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23186.52s)]
*  Mr. Deloni, if you have discussed the option of starting here with Italy on supply communications, and President Trump, if you want to see the Google company or not? [[06:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23200.52s)]
*  The Google what? The Google company. What about the Google business? [[06:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23211.52s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about about the Starlink. We've been discussing about defense space. [[06:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23216.52s)]
*  We are we will work together also in the Mars missions. So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[06:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23225.52s)]

*  they were trump tariffs he tried to weaken them he did everything he could you know he got paid money by china right the family got paid money he did and uh so i don't know maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't but he tried to weaken them but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets you know they couldn't stand not doing it but i took in in the up till this point my tariffs on china nobody ever took in 10 cents from china no [[06:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23305.52s)]
*  other president took in 10 cents i took in more than 700 billion dollars from china so we're uh we're doing very well i mean our our country is doing very well they had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market but [[06:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23335.52s)]
*  this is about that this is really we're building a base we're building a country like no other and again i think i had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far history of any country probably but the history of our country in four years and i think this has a chance to be much better [[06:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23352.96s)]
*  i don't know exactly i'm going to leave that to scott what do you think where would it be signed and when [[06:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23370.4s)]
*  we're still working on the details for around April 26th is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together it's substantially what we agreed on previously but the president was here we had a numbering of understanding we went straight to the big deal and the i think it's an 80-page agreement and that's what will be signed [[06:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23384.64s)]
*  on [[06:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23408.88s)]
*  well i think he should do the rate cuts because i think if europe has done it he puts us at a disadvantage to europe i mean he plays right into their hands so i think he should do the rate cuts we don't have really inflation now i just said the major things are going [[06:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23421.84s)]
*  down oil is great oil is way ahead of schedule and that's because of our policies but oil is down into the 60 dollar 65 dollar range now per barrel and i told you in certain states we have less than two dollars for gasoline and food is down groceries as we call it are down [[06:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23437.92s)]
*  other than interest rates everything's down interest rates are pretty flat they're not it's not that they're up but we should be better than flat we should if he would lower the interest rate i think would have a good impact on that too but the costs are down we have very little inflation i would say we have essentially no inflation hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down when when biden came in oil went through the roof that's what caused our problem that and his very dumb spending [[06:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23460.96s)]
*  but when the oil prices go down and they have gone down a lot we've gotten it down really good we've opened it up and we've gotten them down and that means that people driving cars are going to be paying two dollars and two dollars and 50 cents instead of four dollars and 50 cents and you know even at the end they tried they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down but they had really lost that sucker that was really it was not good but if [[06:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23490.96s)]
*  they had one oil right now would be at seven or eight dollars because of their policy and we're going to be at about two dollars could be even a little bit less than that and you're starting to see it so i don't know how you can have inflation when oil is has come down quite a bit and and i would say the fed really owes it to the american people to get interest rates down that's the only thing he's good for and he would have an effect on that if he if he if he lowered them and [[06:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23520.88s)]
*  i think at some point he will he's going to have a lot of political pressure you know they are [[06:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23550.88s)]
*  political also and i think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates okay [[06:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=23556.16s)]

*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[06:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24905.36s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[06:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24909.36s)]
*  and then we will see because we are absolutely aware of the fact [[06:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24913.36s)]
*  that it is very important to, defense is very important. [[06:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24916.36s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[06:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24921.36s)]
*  I will do that. [[06:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24922.36s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another percentage about the defense spending, [[06:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24923.36s)]
*  and I said, yes, NATO, and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent [[06:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24930.36s)]
*  as it was already decided. [[06:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24935.36s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[06:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24937.36s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[06:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24941.36s)]
*  and we see also the war that we are trying to do at the European level. [[06:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24946.36s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[06:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24951.36s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[06:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24955.36s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[06:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24961.36s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[06:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24964.36s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[06:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24967.36s)]
*  and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[06:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24970.36s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[06:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24972.36s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[06:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24974.36s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[06:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24976.36s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[06:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24981.36s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[06:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24984.36s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[06:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24990.36s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[06:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24991.36s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[06:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24992.36s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[06:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24994.36s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[06:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24995.36s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[06:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24997.36s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[06:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=24999.36s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were President. [[06:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25000.36s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[06:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25004.36s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[06:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25011.36s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[06:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25013.36s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[06:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25020.36s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[06:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25023.36s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that... [[06:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25025.36s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. [[06:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25027.36s)]
*  If I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[06:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25028.36s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[06:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25031.36s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[06:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25033.36s)]
*  Okay? [[06:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25038.36s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[06:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25039.36s)]
*  I really am. [[06:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25040.36s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[06:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25041.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25042.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25048.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25049.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25050.36s)]
*  He's never said. [[06:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25052.36s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[06:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25054.36s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[06:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25068.36s)]
*  Yes. [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25071.16s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[06:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25071.86s)]
*  No, I haven't said it. [[06:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25072.56s)]
*  I don't know what you're talking about. [[06:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25073.760000000002s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[06:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25076.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[06:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25079.56s)]
*  No, no, wait, wait. [[06:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25081.56s)]
*  Next. [[06:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25082.46s)]
*  Next. [[06:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25083.56s)]
*  Go. [[06:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25084.36s)]
*  Foreign Minister Mili just said you want to make Europe great again. [[06:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25085.760000000002s)]
*  And we want to do it together. [[06:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25090.46s)]
*  Together, to the West. [[06:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25091.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[06:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25092.96s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister. [[06:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25093.56s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[06:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25097.96s)]
*  And are you looking to do it to counter China? [[06:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25099.16s)]
*  Who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[06:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25102.66s)]
*  What are the health benefits, George? [[06:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25107.96s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[06:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25109.96s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, [[06:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25112.16s)]
*  and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[06:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25113.96s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[06:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25117.059999999998s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, [[06:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25121.96s)]
*  because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration. [[06:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25124.46s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, [[06:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25128.86s)]
*  that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[06:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25130.059999999998s)]
*  And I commented to her before, I said, [[06:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25135.36s)]
*  I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject, [[06:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25137.76s)]
*  but they're not. [[06:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25140.76s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[06:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25143.46s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[06:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25145.26s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[06:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25147.059999999998s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[06:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25148.86s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[06:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25152.36s)]
*  You've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, [[06:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25154.66s)]
*  let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[06:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25159.56s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about [[06:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25161.86s)]
*  how we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[06:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25165.06s)]
*  Now, we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[06:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25168.760000000002s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, [[06:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25173.260000000002s)]
*  and to return people. [[06:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25176.56s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations [[06:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25178.559999999998s)]
*  and things like that. [[06:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25183.96s)]
*  So things are changing. [[06:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25184.76s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates [[06:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25186.66s)]
*  of illegal migration. [[06:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25192.46s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[06:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25193.96s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[06:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25197.36s)]
*  I have discussed the option of starting here with Italy on [[07:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25208.46s)]
*  supply communications. [[07:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25211.46s)]
*  And President Trump, if you want to see the Google company... [[07:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25213.26s)]
*  The Google what? [[07:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25218.96s)]
*  The Google company. [[07:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25220.059999999998s)]
*  What about it? [[07:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25221.46s)]
*  The Google business. [[07:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25222.059999999998s)]
*  I want to see it now. [[07:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25222.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25224.96s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[07:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25226.16s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[07:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25229.559999999998s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[07:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25233.36s)]
*  There are big, big things to do together, [[07:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25238.26s)]
*  but we didn't discuss it. [[07:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25241.059999999998s)]
*  The Press. [[07:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25242.559999999998s)]
*  The United States is a prime minister. [[07:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25243.559999999998s)]
*  Is there a change in your view as a prime minister that [[07:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25245.559999999998s)]
*  changed your mind potentially about tariffs and what you can [[07:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25248.76s)]
*  do to go forward in trading? [[07:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25251.559999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister, is that to you? [[07:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25253.059999999998s)]
*  That changed your perspective? [[07:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25254.359999999997s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[07:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25255.26s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden, [[07:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25257.26s)]
*  trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[07:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25261.66s)]
*  And now that's that whole tide has turned. [[07:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25265.36s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[07:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25268.260000000002s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[07:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25270.06s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, [[07:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25271.06s)]
*  25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[07:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25274.16s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[07:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25280.06s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing [[07:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25283.36s)]
*  fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[07:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25290.16s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while [[07:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25294.16s)]
*  I sit here and talk to you. [[07:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25296.76s)]
*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, [[07:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25299.86s)]
*  other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[07:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25302.56s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China, [[07:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25305.76s)]
*  where we took in, up until this point, [[07:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25307.46s)]
*  probably $700 billion. [[07:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25309.66s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[07:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25312.46s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[07:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25313.76s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[07:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25315.76s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[07:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25316.96s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[07:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25318.76s)]
*  He did. [[07:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25320.26s)]
*  And so, I don't know, maybe that was the reason, [[07:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25321.56s)]
*  or maybe it wasn't. [[07:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25324.460000000003s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't, [[07:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25325.460000000003s)]
*  because there was so much money that his budgets — [[07:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25327.56s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[07:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25330.66s)]
*  But I took in, in the — up until this point, [[07:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25333.760000000002s)]
*  my tariffs on China. [[07:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25338.66s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[07:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25340.16s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[07:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25342.36s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[07:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25344.06s)]
*  So we're doing very well. [[07:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25347.460000000003s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[07:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25350.96s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the [[07:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25352.76s)]
*  healthcare companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[07:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25356.26s)]
*  But this is about the — this is really — we're building a base. [[07:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25359.76s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[07:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25363.36s)]
*  And again, I think — I had the strongest economy [[07:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25365.76s)]
*  in the history of our country by far — [[07:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25367.96s)]
*  the history of any country, probably, [[07:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25370.06s)]
*  but the history of our country in four years. [[07:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25371.66s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[07:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25374.56s)]
*  The Press. [[07:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25376.96s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[07:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25387.16s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[07:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25388.16s)]
*  What do you think? [[07:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25389.36s)]
*  Where would it be signed and when? [[07:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25390.16s)]
*  I think it's an agreement. [[07:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25406.96s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[07:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25414.059999999998s)]
*  The Press. [[07:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25415.559999999998s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts [[07:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25428.86s)]
*  because I think if Europe has done it, [[07:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25430.76s)]
*  it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[07:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25433.76s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[07:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25435.86s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[07:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25438.760000000002s)]
*  We don't have, really, inflation now. [[07:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25440.36s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[07:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25442.46s)]
*  Oil is great. [[07:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25445.46s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[07:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25447.46s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[07:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25449.56s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60 — $65 range now per barrel. [[07:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25451.56s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, [[07:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25458.06s)]
*  we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[07:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25459.96s)]
*  And food is down. [[07:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25463.059999999998s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[07:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25466.059999999998s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything is down. [[07:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25470.36s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[07:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25472.16s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[07:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25474.36s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[07:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25475.76s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, [[07:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25477.86s)]
*  I think we'd have a good impact on that too. [[07:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25479.46s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[07:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25481.96s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[07:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25484.16s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[07:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25485.36s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[07:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25487.26s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[07:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25489.76s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[07:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25491.26s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[07:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25494.26s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[07:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25495.559999999998s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down — [[07:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25498.859999999997s)]
*  and they have gone down a lot. [[07:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25501.26s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[07:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25502.76s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[07:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25504.859999999997s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars [[07:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25507.46s)]
*  are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[07:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25509.66s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, [[07:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25514.859999999997s)]
*  they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[07:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25516.66s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[07:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25520.76s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[07:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25523.46s)]
*  But if they had won, [[07:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25526.059999999998s)]
*  oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[07:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25528.559999999998s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[07:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25533.359999999997s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[07:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25536.059999999998s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[07:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25537.859999999997s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation [[07:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25539.359999999997s)]
*  when oil has come down quite a bit. [[07:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25541.359999999997s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people [[07:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25543.76s)]
*  to get interest rates down. [[07:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25550.06s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[07:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25551.260000000002s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[07:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25553.36s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[07:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25556.56s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[07:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25559.56s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[07:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25561.16s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure [[07:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25564.56s)]
*  for him to lower interest rates. [[07:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25566.36s)]
*  Okay? [[07:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25568.460000000003s)]
*  The Press. [[07:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25570.06s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[07:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25572.760000000002s)]
*  Please. [[07:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25574.06s)]
*  The thing that Italy can do your best to lie in Europe [[07:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25574.960000000003s)]
*  and also, there are no issues with the world. [[07:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25577.46s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains a Prime Minister [[07:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25580.66s)]
*  can it be our best. [[07:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25584.26s)]
*  She's doing now. [[07:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25586.66s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[07:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25587.66s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, [[07:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25588.76s)]
*  not just in Europe, anywhere. [[07:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25592.059999999998s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[07:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25594.26s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[07:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25598.059999999998s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[07:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25600.76s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[07:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25604.059999999998s)]

*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[07:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25642.86s)]
*  Tallahassee, active shooting. [[07:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25646.16s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[07:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25649.46s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[07:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25653.059999999998s)]
*  It's a shame. [[07:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25655.86s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[07:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25657.16s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[07:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25658.16s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[07:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25661.66s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime [[07:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25664.86s)]
*  Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, [[07:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25667.16s)]
*  who's doing a fantastic job. [[07:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25670.96s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm [[07:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25673.66s)]
*  and highly respected. [[07:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25677.36s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[07:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25678.86s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[07:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25681.66s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[07:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25684.36s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy [[07:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25686.66s)]
*  and ourselves. [[07:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25691.36s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[07:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25692.36s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[07:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25694.16s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very [[07:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25698.16s)]
*  special person. [[07:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25701.96s)]

*  Thank you very much. [[07:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25704.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[07:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25705.36s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[07:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25707.76s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen [[07:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25710.66s)]
*  our relationship, our friendship that comes from [[07:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25714.46s)]
*  very far. [[07:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25716.56s)]
*  You know, today is April 17th. [[07:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25717.56s)]
*  And April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement [[07:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25720.16s)]
*  that allowed Christopher Colombo to make his trip. [[07:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25725.26s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties, but also [[07:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25728.86s)]
*  to remind that we both share another fight, which is the [[07:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25733.86s)]
*  fight against the war and ADI ideology that would like to [[07:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25738.26s)]
*  erase our history. [[07:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25744.26s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling [[07:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25746.359999999997s)]
*  illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[07:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25751.359999999997s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan [[07:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25756.76s)]
*  against fentanyl, for example. [[07:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25760.859999999997s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and [[07:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25763.26s)]
*  things that we can do together about defense, about economic [[07:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25768.859999999997s)]
*  and about space, about energy. [[07:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25774.46s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports. [[07:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25781.36s)]
*  And also nuclear that we are trying to develop, I think there [[07:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25787.559999999998s)]
*  can be ways to work together. [[07:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25790.86s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest, as they've been doing [[07:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25794.059999999998s)]
*  for many years, as you know, in the next years, I think around [[07:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25800.859999999997s)]
*  10 billions. [[07:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25805.559999999998s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[07:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25806.96s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[07:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25810.559999999998s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[07:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25812.359999999997s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[07:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25816.76s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in this [[07:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25823.059999999998s)]
*  week. [[07:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25828.359999999997s)]
*  At the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying [[07:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25829.76s)]
*  it before, such a Western nationalism. [[07:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25832.46s)]
*  I don't know if this is the right word, but I know that when [[07:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25835.36s)]
*  I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about a geographical [[07:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25839.06s)]
*  space. [[07:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25842.36s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[07:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25843.26s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[07:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25845.66s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems, okay, between the two [[07:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25847.86s)]
*  shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down [[07:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25853.16s)]
*  and find solutions. [[07:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25858.06s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an [[07:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25859.26s)]
*  invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near [[07:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25863.66s)]
*  future and consider a possibility in that occasion to [[07:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25866.859999999997s)]
*  meet also with Europe. [[07:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25870.559999999998s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[07:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25873.559999999998s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[07:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25876.76s)]
*  We can. [[07:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25878.76s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[07:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25880.16s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[07:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25883.76s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister [[07:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25885.059999999998s)]
*  of Italy that today has very good as a very good situation [[07:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25888.26s)]
*  despite the difficulties of stable country, really reliable [[07:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25895.26s)]
*  country, one million more jobs in the last two years and a [[07:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25898.26s)]
*  half. [[07:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25902.76s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[07:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25904.26s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a [[07:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25905.66s)]
*  businessman and you understand me. [[07:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25910.059999999998s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[07:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25912.46s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even [[07:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25915.86s)]
*  better together. [[07:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25918.760000000002s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close together. [[07:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25919.86s)]
*  We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. [[07:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25922.260000000002s)]
*  We can build a just and lasting peace. [[07:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25924.46s)]
*  We support your efforts. [[07:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25926.06s)]

*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get [[07:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25930.760000000002s)]
*  it done and we'll see if we can. [[07:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25933.36s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[07:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25935.760000000002s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[07:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25937.86s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly [[07:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25938.86s)]
*  soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[07:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25941.66s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[07:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25944.66s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[07:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25947.760000000002s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know [[07:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25949.260000000002s)]

*  How much longer does the fire? [[07:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=25956.86s)]

*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said [[07:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26054.760000000002s)]
*  I'm going to get the criminals that he allowed to come into [[07:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26058.86s)]

*  very well. [[07:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26122.16s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[07:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26122.66s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[07:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26125.86s)]
*  Go ahead Scott. [[07:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26128.059999999998s)]

*  Also talking that's moving very quickly. [[07:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26147.46s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be [[07:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26167.86s)]
*  signed on Thursday, Scott. [[07:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26170.26s)]
*  Next Thursday. [[07:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26171.76s)]
*  Soon and I assume they're going to live up to the deal. [[07:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26173.26s)]
*  So we'll see. [[07:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26176.86s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[07:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26177.56s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[07:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26181.260000000002s)]
*  I have no idea. [[07:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26182.760000000002s)]

*  And they say the attack is what I wouldn't say waved off. [[07:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26194.56s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has [[07:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26202.36s)]
*  a chance to have a great country and to live happily [[07:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26206.16s)]
*  without death. [[07:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26210.36s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[07:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26212.06s)]
*  That's my first option. [[07:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26213.06s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for [[07:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26215.76s)]
*  Iran. [[07:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26219.46s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[07:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26221.06s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[07:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26225.36s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[07:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26226.56s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran be thrive in the future do [[07:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26228.46s)]
*  fantastically. [[07:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26232.66s)]
*  Well, I know the Iranian people. [[07:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26233.46s)]
*  They're incredible people always have been very smart, [[07:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26235.66s)]
*  very energetic, very successful people. [[07:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26238.86s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[07:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26242.06s)]
*  I really don't but Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[07:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26246.06s)]
*  It's, you know, pretty simple. [[07:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26249.56s)]
*  It's really simple. [[07:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26251.16s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[07:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26252.86s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[07:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26255.76s)]
*  We're not always saying is we you can't have a nuclear weapon [[07:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26258.16s)]
*  the deal that was made the deal that was made with Obama. [[07:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26261.86s)]
*  And that deal would have expired already. [[07:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26266.06s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[07:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26267.66s)]
*  It was it would have expired and that gave them a clear path [[07:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26268.86s)]
*  to a nuclear weapon. [[07:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26273.36s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted this why I terminated the deal number [[07:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26274.66s)]
*  one. [[07:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26277.36s)]
*  It was way too short. [[07:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26277.56s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short [[07:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26279.16s)]
*  term deals. [[07:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26282.46s)]
*  These are countries with long lives and I terminated that [[07:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26283.06s)]
*  and it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to [[07:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26288.56s)]
*  do anything once it terminated. [[07:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26291.46s)]
*  You know what the deal was. [[07:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26293.06s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[07:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26293.96s)]
*  Really met one of many terrible deals made by the US. [[07:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26295.46s)]
*  But no, I want I'd like to see Iran thrive and they can do [[07:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26299.86s)]
*  that. [[07:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26305.76s)]
*  I think very easily or they can do it the other way. [[07:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26306.16s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them going to be [[07:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26309.46s)]
*  really bad for them. [[07:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26311.76s)]
*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy has become a friend of mine [[07:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26320.86s)]

*  have gone through the roof. [[07:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26556.760000000002s)]
*  I said I just got here. [[07:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26558.06s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone [[07:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26559.86s)]
*  through the roof before I got there and they were screaming [[07:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26563.06s)]
*  at me the press the fake news like you you're fake and the [[07:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26566.06s)]
*  fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[07:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26569.56s)]
*  I said I've only been here. [[07:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26572.96s)]
*  I just this is my seventh day and they were right. [[07:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26574.46s)]
*  They went up 87% and you couldn't get them. [[07:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26577.66s)]
*  They said you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming [[07:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26580.16s)]
*  up. [[07:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26582.96s)]
*  Happy Easter everybody. [[07:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26583.16s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter and we did an unbelievable [[07:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26584.76s)]
*  job and now eggs have all over the place and the price went [[07:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26588.16s)]
*  down 92% and our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke has [[07:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26591.46s)]
*  done a fantastic job. [[07:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26597.36s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[07:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26599.76s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[07:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26601.46s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates [[07:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26602.76s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing [[07:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26606.059999999998s)]
*  politics as somebody that I've never been very fond of [[07:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26609.359999999997s)]
*  actually, but he's playing politics interest rates should [[07:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26613.359999999997s)]
*  be down now. [[07:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26617.559999999998s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe as you know, they [[07:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26618.359999999997s)]
*  reduce them. [[07:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26621.76s)]
*  Just seven times. [[07:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26623.46s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again [[07:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26624.559999999998s)]
*  and again, but our guy wants to play cute but interest rates [[07:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26626.66s)]
*  are pretty much even maybe they went up just a slight [[07:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26632.76s)]
*  bit, but that's the only thing but that's because of the [[07:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26635.56s)]
*  Federal Reserve because they're not very smart people. [[07:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26637.56s)]
*  Go ahead. [[07:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26644.56s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[07:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26644.960000000003s)]
*  Please go ahead. [[07:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26645.460000000003s)]
*  Please. [[07:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26647.16s)]
*  Look in the first four years, we had the greatest economy [[07:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26651.760000000002s)]
*  in the history of our country. [[07:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26655.260000000002s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[07:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26656.36s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had [[07:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26659.36s)]
*  the most successful administration economically in [[07:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26662.760000000002s)]
*  the history of our country. [[07:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26665.36s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you [[07:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26667.66s)]
*  will see that the numbers that were taken in are astronomical [[07:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26670.16s)]
*  were taken in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[07:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26674.56s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade and the countries are [[07:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26677.96s)]
*  getting having a hard time getting used to the fact that [[07:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26682.56s)]
*  they can't do that to us anymore because we have a real [[07:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26684.86s)]
*  president. [[07:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26687.66s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[07:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26688.16s)]
*  We had presidents that in some cases were smart, but they [[07:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26692.06s)]
*  didn't understand business or they didn't like business or [[07:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26696.760000000002s)]
*  you know, it wasn't like a priority and then you had like [[07:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26699.66s)]
*  the last administration. [[07:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26702.66s)]
*  The only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[07:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26703.86s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[07:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26706.260000000002s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[07:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26707.36s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[07:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26708.86s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country worse [[07:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26709.86s)]
*  than Jimmy Carter. [[07:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26713.460000000003s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[07:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26714.260000000002s)]
*  You know why? [[07:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26716.56s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[07:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26718.06s)]
*  Joe Biden was so I think you're going to see some fantastic [[07:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26720.260000000002s)]

*  It's happening now. [[07:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26727.56s)]
*  I mean everybody wants to make a deal and if they don't want [[07:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26728.460000000003s)]

*  Have some respect, please. [[07:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26864.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26865.86s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[07:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26866.86s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[07:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26867.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26868.86s)]
*  The President, Prime Minister Maroni, was asked whether what she thinks about the President's [[07:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26869.86s)]
*  Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[07:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26870.86s)]
*  And also, you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending. [[07:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26891.86s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Maroni said is that, no, actually, we didn't talk [[07:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26906.86s)]
*  about the raise of military spending. [[07:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26913.86s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, and then we will see, because [[07:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26915.86s)]
*  we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... [[07:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26920.86s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[07:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26925.86s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[07:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26926.86s)]
*  I will do that. [[07:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26927.86s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided on another defense percentage about the defense spending. [[07:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26928.86s)]
*  Right, Nera. [[07:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26936.86s)]
*  Yes, NATO. [[07:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26937.86s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[07:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26938.86s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that [[07:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26943.86s)]
*  defense is important for the future, and we see also the war that we are trying to do [[07:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26949.86s)]
*  at the European level. [[07:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26955.86s)]
*  And I don't hold... [[07:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26957.86s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that [[07:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26959.86s)]
*  war started. [[07:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26966.86s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[07:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26967.86s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[07:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26971.86s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have their beautiful [[07:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26974.86s)]
*  terraces. [[07:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26978.86s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[07:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26979.86s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a million pieces, getting hit [[07:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26983.86s)]
*  by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[07:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26988.86s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[07:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26991.86s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[07:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26997.86s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[07:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26998.86s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[07:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=26999.86s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[07:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27000.86s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[07:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27001.86s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[07:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27003.86s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were [[07:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27006.86s)]
*  President. [[07:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27009.86s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[07:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27010.86s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[07:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27017.86s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[07:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27020.86s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[07:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27027.86s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[07:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27030.86s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that... [[07:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27032.86s)]
*  And everybody agrees to it. [[07:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27034.86s)]
*  If I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[07:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27035.86s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[07:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27038.86s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[07:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27040.86s)]
*  Okay? [[07:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27044.86s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[07:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27045.86s)]
*  I really am. [[07:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27046.86s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. [[07:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27047.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[07:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27048.86s)]

*  Go ahead. [[07:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27050.86s)]
*  Are you sure about the definition of a parasite, for Europeans? [[07:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27052.86s)]
*  Would you say again that Europeans are parasites? [[07:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27071.86s)]
*  He's never said it. [[07:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27072.86s)]
*  The European... [[07:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27073.86s)]
*  Have you said that Europeans are parasites? [[07:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27074.86s)]
*  Yes. [[07:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27077.86s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[07:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27078.86s)]
*  No. [[07:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27079.86s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[07:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27080.86s)]

*  The Press. [[07:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27170.86s)]
*  We are working now together. [[07:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27201.86s)]
*  So I'm optimistic. [[07:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27203.86s)]

*  The Google what? [[07:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27223.86s)]
*  The Google company. [[07:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27226.46s)]
*  What about it? [[07:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27228.16s)]
*  The Google business. [[07:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27228.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[07:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27229.66s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27230.16s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[07:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27232.86s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[07:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27235.86s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[07:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27239.86s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, [[07:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27244.86s)]
*  but we didn't discuss it. [[07:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27247.86s)]
*  The thing that changed your mind potentially about tariffs [[07:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27249.86s)]
*  and what you can and can't do going forward. [[07:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27254.86s)]
*  No. [[07:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27259.86s)]
*  That changed your perspective. [[07:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27260.86s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[07:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27261.86s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[07:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27263.86s)]
*  Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[07:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27267.86s)]
*  And now that's that whole tide has turned. [[07:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27271.86s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[07:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27274.86s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[07:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27276.86s)]
*  Don't forget we're taking in 25 percent on cars, [[07:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27277.86s)]
*  25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[07:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27280.86s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[07:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27286.86s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing [[07:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27289.86s)]
*  fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[07:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27296.86s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit [[07:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27300.86s)]
*  here and talk to you. [[07:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27303.86s)]
*  And we didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the [[07:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27305.86s)]
*  tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[07:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27309.86s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until [[07:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27311.86s)]
*  this point, probably 700 billion dollars. [[07:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27315.86s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[07:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27318.86s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[07:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27319.86s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[07:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27321.86s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[07:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27323.86s)]
*  Family got paid money. [[07:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27325.86s)]
*  He did. [[07:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27326.86s)]
*  And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[07:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27327.86s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so [[07:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27331.86s)]
*  much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[07:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27334.86s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China. [[07:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27339.86s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[07:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27346.86s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[07:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27348.86s)]
*  I took in more than 700 billion dollars from China. [[07:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27350.86s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. [[07:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27353.86s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[07:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27356.86s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that [[07:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27358.86s)]
*  had an impact on the stock market. [[07:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27363.86s)]
*  But this is about that. [[07:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27365.86s)]
*  This is really we're building a base. [[07:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27367.86s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[07:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27369.86s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far [[07:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27371.86s)]
*  history of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[07:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27375.86s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[07:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27380.86s)]
*  Much better. [[07:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27382.86s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[07:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27393.86s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[07:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27394.86s)]
*  What do you think? [[07:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27395.86s)]
*  Where would it be signed and what? [[07:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27396.86s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[07:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27398.86s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 26. [[07:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27400.86s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[07:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27402.86s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. [[07:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27406.86s)]
*  We had a numbering of understanding. [[07:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27412.86s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an agreement. [[07:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27414.86s)]
*  And that's what we'll be signing. [[07:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27420.86s)]
*  President, on rate cuts, can you clarify on rate cuts? [[07:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27421.86s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell's firing if he doesn't change the standard rate cuts? [[07:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27427.86s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[07:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27433.86s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[07:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27434.86s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[07:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27441.86s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[07:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27444.86s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[07:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27446.86s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[07:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27448.86s)]
*  Oil is great. [[07:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27451.86s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[07:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27453.86s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[07:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27455.86s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[07:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27457.86s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[07:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27463.86s)]
*  And food is down. [[07:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27468.86s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[07:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27471.86s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[07:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27474.86s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[07:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27478.86s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[07:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27479.86s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[07:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27481.86s)]
*  We should. [[07:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27483.86s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[07:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27484.86s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[07:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27488.86s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[07:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27490.86s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[07:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27491.86s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[07:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27493.86s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[07:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27495.86s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[07:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27497.86s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[07:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27500.86s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[07:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27501.86s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, we've gotten it down really good. [[07:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27504.86s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[07:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27511.86s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.00 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[07:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27513.86s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[07:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27521.86s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[07:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27526.86s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[07:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27529.86s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[07:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27532.86s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2.00. [[07:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27539.86s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[07:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27542.86s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[07:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27544.86s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[07:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27545.86s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[07:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27550.86s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[07:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27557.86s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[07:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27559.86s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[07:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27563.86s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[07:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27565.86s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[07:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27567.86s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[07:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27570.86s)]
*  Okay? [[07:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27574.86s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[07:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27575.86s)]
*  Please. [[07:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27579.86s)]
*  The Press. [[07:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27580.86s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe? [[07:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27581.86s)]
*  And also, do you have a notice when you walk into certain events? [[07:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27583.86s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[07:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27586.86s)]
*  She's doing — no, she's doing a great job. [[07:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27591.86s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[07:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27594.86s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[07:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27600.86s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[07:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27604.86s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[07:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27606.86s)]
*  And they like Trump, and they voted for Trump. [[07:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27610.86s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[07:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27613.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27615.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27617.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27618.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27620.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27622.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27624.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27626.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27628.86s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[07:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27630.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27632.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27634.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27636.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27638.86s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[07:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27647.86s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, Tallahassee, active shooting. [[07:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27649.86s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[07:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27655.86s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[07:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27658.86s)]
*  It's a shame. [[07:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27662.86s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[07:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27663.86s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[07:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27664.86s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[07:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27667.86s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us, [[07:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27670.86s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney, who's doing a fantastic job. [[07:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27676.86s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and highly respected. [[07:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27680.86s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[07:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27685.86s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[07:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27688.86s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[07:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27690.86s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy and ourselves. [[07:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27693.86s)]
*  We talked about trade. [[07:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27699.86s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[07:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27700.86s)]
*  And she'll be saying a few words, but she's a very special person. [[07:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27704.86s)]
*  And it's nice to have you with us. [[07:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27709.86s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27710.86s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. President. [[07:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27712.86s)]
*  Thank you for your warm welcome. [[07:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27714.86s)]
*  Thank you for this occasion, which is aimed to strengthen our relationship, our friendship that comes from Grifoie. [[07:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27716.86s)]
*  You know today is April 17. [[07:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27723.86s)]
*  And April 17 marks the anniversary of the agreement that allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[07:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27726.86s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties, but also to remind that we both share another fight, [[07:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27735.86s)]
*  which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like to erase our history. [[07:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27744.86s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[07:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27752.86s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[07:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27763.86s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together about defense, [[07:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27769.86s)]
*  about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[07:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27779.86s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[07:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27785.86s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[07:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27796.86s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years, as you know, in the next years, I think around 10 billions. [[07:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27799.86s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[07:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27812.86s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[07:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27816.86s)]
*  It's not only about Italy. [[07:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27818.86s)]
*  It's about the entire Europe. [[07:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27820.86s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[07:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27822.86s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in the next week. [[07:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27827.86s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[07:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27835.86s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[07:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27841.86s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[07:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27849.86s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[07:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27851.86s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[07:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27854.86s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the near future and consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[07:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27865.86s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[07:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27879.86s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[07:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27882.86s)]
*  We can. [[07:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27884.86s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[07:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27885.86s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[07:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27889.86s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has a very good situation despite the difficulties. [[07:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27891.86s)]
*  A stable country, a reliable country. [[07:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27902.86s)]
*  One million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[07:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27905.86s)]
*  Great inflation is going down. [[07:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27909.86s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[07:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27911.86s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[07:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27918.86s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[07:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27921.86s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close together. [[07:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27925.86s)]
*  We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. [[07:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27928.86s)]
*  We can build a just and lasting peace. [[07:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27930.86s)]
*  We support your efforts. [[07:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27932.86s)]
*  Good. [[07:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27934.86s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[07:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27935.86s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[07:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27936.86s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[07:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27941.86s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[07:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27943.86s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[07:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27944.86s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[07:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27950.86s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[07:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27953.86s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[07:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27955.86s)]
*  And you've been very helpful. [[07:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27958.86s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[07:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27959.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27960.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27961.86s)]
*  Any questions? [[07:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27962.86s)]
*  Mr. President, how much longer does Wagner-Krugman have to respond to your ceasefire proposal [[07:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27963.86s)]
*  before you put secondary terrorists or sanctions on Russia? [[07:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27972.86s)]
*  We'll see what that will be. [[07:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27976.86s)]
*  We're going to be hearing from them this week, very shortly, actually. [[07:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27978.86s)]
*  And we'll see. [[07:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27984.86s)]
*  But we want it to stop. [[07:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27985.86s)]
*  We want the death and the killing to stop. [[07:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27986.86s)]
*  Mr. President, on Jerome Powell, you said that the termination of Jerome Powell cannot come fast enough. [[07:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27989.86s)]
*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[07:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27995.86s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. [[07:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27998.86s)]
*  If I ask him to, he'll be out of there. [[07:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=27999.86s)]
*  But I don't think he's I don't think he I don't think he's doing the job. [[07:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28001.86s)]
*  He's too late, always too late, a little slow. [[07:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28006.86s)]
*  And I'm not happy with him. [[07:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28010.86s)]
*  I let him know it. [[07:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28013.86s)]
*  And if I want him out, he'll be out of there real fast. [[07:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28015.86s)]
*  Believe me. [[07:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28019.86s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[07:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28020.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28021.86s)]
*  Question. [[07:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28023.86s)]
*  Are you trying to remove him as your president? [[07:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28024.86s)]
*  Yeah, question. [[07:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28025.86s)]
*  Mr. President, would you hesitate to oppose for if a case against your administration [[07:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28026.86s)]
*  in the Constitution does not tolerate billful disobedience of judicial order? [[07:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28032.86s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement? [[07:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28036.86s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[07:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28037.86s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[07:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28039.86s)]
*  I can tell you this. [[07:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28041.86s)]
*  We're doing a fantastic job of getting criminals out of this country who Biden allowed into [[07:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28042.86s)]
*  the country, hundreds of thousands of criminals, murderers and drug dealers. [[07:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28047.86s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was a number one factor. [[07:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28053.86s)]
*  A lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[07:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28059.86s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said I'm going to get the criminals [[07:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28061.86s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[07:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28066.86s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[07:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28070.86s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[07:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28072.86s)]
*  We won everything. [[07:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28077.86s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[07:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28078.86s)]
*  We won everything. [[07:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28080.86s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted. [[07:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28082.86s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[07:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28084.86s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[07:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28085.86s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you think of the proposal from France and the UK about this mission [[07:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28088.86s)]
*  in Ukraine with soldiers? [[07:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28095.86s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should make a promise with them? [[07:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28097.86s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[07:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28100.86s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[07:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28103.86s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[07:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28106.86s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[07:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28107.86s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what your cooperation discussed with the foreign minister [[07:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28108.86s)]
*  in Italy and the United States and Europe and the United States? [[07:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28113.86s)]
*  And on China? [[07:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28117.86s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[07:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28118.86s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[07:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28119.86s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[07:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28124.86s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[07:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28129.86s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[07:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28132.86s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[07:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28134.86s)]
*  Would you say something? [[07:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28135.86s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[07:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28136.86s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[07:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28138.86s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[07:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28141.86s)]
*  I believe there's been calls with the EU already. [[07:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28145.86s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[07:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28148.86s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[07:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28151.86s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[07:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28155.86s)]
*  Mr. President, do you have any evidence that China is supplying weaponry or ammunition to Russia? [[07:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28157.86s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[07:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28168.86s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[07:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28170.86s)]
*  Is that a deal? [[07:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28173.86s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[07:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28174.86s)]
*  and next Thursday. [[07:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28177.86s)]
*  Soon? [[07:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28179.86s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[07:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28180.86s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[07:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28183.86s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[07:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28186.86s)]
*  I have no idea. [[07:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28188.86s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[07:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28189.86s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[07:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28192.86s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[07:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28197.86s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[07:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28198.86s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[07:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28200.86s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[07:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28202.86s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[07:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28207.86s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[07:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28208.86s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[07:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28214.86s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[07:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28217.86s)]
*  That's my first option. [[07:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28219.86s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[07:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28221.86s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[07:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28226.86s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[07:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28230.86s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[07:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28232.86s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[07:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28234.86s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[07:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28240.86s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[07:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28243.86s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[07:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28247.86s)]
*  I really don't. [[07:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28252.86s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[07:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28253.86s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[07:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28255.86s)]
*  It's really simple. [[07:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28257.86s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[07:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28258.86s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[07:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28261.86s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[07:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28264.86s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, [[07:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28267.86s)]
*  that deal would have expired already. [[07:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28271.86s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[07:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28273.86s)]
*  It would have expired. [[07:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28275.86s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[07:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28277.86s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[07:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28280.86s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[07:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28281.86s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[07:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28283.86s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[07:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28285.86s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[07:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28289.86s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[07:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28291.86s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[07:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28294.86s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[07:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28298.86s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[07:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28300.86s)]
*  Really. [[07:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28301.86s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[07:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28302.86s)]
*  But, no, I want, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[07:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28305.86s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily, or they can do it the other way. [[07:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28310.86s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[07:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28315.86s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[07:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28317.86s)]
*  President, what do you make of the video of the CEO going to China [[07:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28319.86s)]
*  and met with trade officials there? [[07:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28324.86s)]
*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy. [[07:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28326.86s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[07:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28328.86s)]
*  And, I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[07:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28330.86s)]
*  He loves our country. [[07:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28334.86s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[07:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28335.86s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're able to, if we're able to be content, [[07:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28337.86s)]
*  will you take steps to return Kilmar Abrego-Varghese to the United States [[07:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28342.86s)]
*  and put him in front of a judge? [[07:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28347.86s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[07:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28348.86s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[07:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28350.86s)]
*  I've heard many things about him, and we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[07:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28355.86s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, [[07:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28363.86s)]
*  many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[07:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28369.86s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[07:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28371.86s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[07:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28373.86s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[07:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28378.86s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[07:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28381.86s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person, and they're on the loose. [[07:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28385.86s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country, [[07:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28390.86s)]
*  or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[07:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28395.86s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[07:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28398.86s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[07:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28403.86s)]
*  Tom Oldman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[07:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28405.86s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[07:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28409.86s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[07:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28411.86s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[07:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28413.86s)]
*  We have, right now, 99 percent border. [[07:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28415.86s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[07:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28418.86s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be possible. [[07:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28419.86s)]
*  Nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[07:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28421.86s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[07:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28424.86s)]
*  We allowed them. [[07:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28427.86s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[07:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28428.86s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[07:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28432.86s)]
*  We have a great border. [[07:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28435.86s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[07:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28436.86s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[07:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28441.86s)]
*  And, you know, we have to — we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[07:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28443.86s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible — you know, they released jails. [[07:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28450.86s)]
*  Georgia, from all over the world, they released them — not just South America, [[07:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28456.86s)]
*  all over the world, the Congo and Africa. [[07:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28460.86s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[07:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28463.86s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[07:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28465.86s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails. [[07:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28468.86s)]
*  Venezuela, practically all of their prisoners, released into our country. [[07:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28472.86s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration [[07:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28476.86s)]
*  called the Biden administration. [[07:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28480.86s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country — and I was elected to straighten that out, [[07:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28483.86s)]
*  and I'm doing that — but we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[07:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28489.86s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[07:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28496.86s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[07:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28502.86s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28504.86s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[07:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28510.86s)]
*  The Press. [[07:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28515.86s)]
*  Last night on stream, Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals will be done, [[07:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28518.86s)]
*  but you also said that you're in no rush. [[07:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28522.86s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. [[07:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28524.86s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[07:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28527.86s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better, because if you were truthful — which you're not, [[07:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28530.86s)]
*  you know, I know you very well — you have gasoline that hit. [[07:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28536.86s)]
*  At Dowland 98 yesterday, in a couple of states, you have gasoline's way down. [[07:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28542.86s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[07:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28546.86s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[07:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28550.86s)]
*  The price of eggs — you know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[07:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28554.86s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week, and they started screaming at me, [[07:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28559.86s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. I said, I just got here. [[07:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28562.86s)]
*  I was there for seven days, and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[07:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28565.86s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news, like you. You're fake. [[07:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28570.86s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[07:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28575.86s)]
*  I said, I've only been here — this is my seventh day. [[07:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28579.86s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[07:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28582.86s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[07:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28586.86s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[07:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28589.86s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[07:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28592.86s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place, and the price went down 92 percent. [[07:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28594.86s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[07:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28599.86s)]
*  They've really done a fantastic job. So prices haven't gone up. [[07:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28605.86s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[07:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28608.86s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[07:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28612.86s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[07:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28617.86s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[07:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28620.86s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down. [[07:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28622.86s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[07:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28626.86s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[07:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28630.86s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[07:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28633.86s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[07:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28636.86s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[07:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28640.86s)]
*  That's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[07:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28643.86s)]
*  Go ahead, sir, please. [[07:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28650.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28652.86s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[07:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28658.86s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[07:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28662.86s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain, [[07:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28665.86s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country. [[07:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28668.86s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[07:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28672.86s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. [[07:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28675.86s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[07:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28680.86s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[07:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28683.86s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore, [[07:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28686.86s)]
*  because we have a real President. [[07:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28692.86s)]
*  We have a President that understands what it's all about. [[07:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28694.86s)]
*  We had Presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[07:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28698.86s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, or they didn't like business, or it wasn't a priority. [[07:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28702.86s)]
*  And then you had the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[07:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28707.86s)]
*  That's about all they could do. They couldn't do anything that was useless. [[07:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28712.86s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[07:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28715.86s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[07:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28716.86s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[07:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28719.86s)]
*  You know why? Because he wasn't the worst President. [[07:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28722.86s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[07:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28726.86s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[07:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28728.86s)]
*  It's happening now. I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[07:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28733.86s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them, [[07:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28736.86s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[07:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28739.86s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[07:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28741.86s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[07:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28743.86s)]
*  I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it [[07:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28745.86s)]
*  that we're listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[07:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28753.86s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal, and that's what we'll be doing. [[07:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28758.86s)]
*  Okay? [[07:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28762.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[07:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28764.86s)]
*  Please. [[07:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28766.86s)]
*  A question. Today, our Prime Minister. [[07:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28768.86s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. You're so lucky. Yes. [[07:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28770.86s)]
*  In Italian. [[07:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28773.86s)]
*  Oh, yes, yes. [[07:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28774.86s)]
*  Okay. [[07:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28775.86s)]
*  I'm not sure that it will be. [[07:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28776.86s)]
*  President Meloni, I want to know what you think about the fact that President Trump [[07:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28778.86s)]
*  considered the Zaleski responsible for the Ukraine war. [[07:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28782.86s)]
*  And then, if you talked about the Italian expenses, what is the maximum limit [[07:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28785.86s)]
*  that he said could be reached by Italy, the percentage of the expenses in Italy? [[07:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28790.86s)]
*  We didn't talk about the maximum limit that Italy could reach. [[07:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28794.86s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is keeping up its commitments, [[07:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28796.86s)]
*  because it will reach the next NATO vertex with the 2%, which was already planned, [[08:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28800.86s)]
*  which was signed by the previous governments, because we are a serious nation, [[08:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28805.86s)]
*  but we didn't talk about how much this percentage will increase, [[08:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28810.86s)]
*  even if we are obviously aware that the issue of defense is a particularly important issue [[08:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28814.86s)]
*  of this time. [[08:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28818.86s)]
*  As far as the Ukraine war is concerned, as I think, I think there was clearly an invasion, [[08:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28820.86s)]
*  that the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, [[08:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28827.86s)]
*  but that's not what reveals today the fact that together we want to work, [[08:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28832.86s)]
*  we are working to try to achieve a peace in Ukraine that can be right and lasting. [[08:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28838.86s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we are making to share our work. [[08:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28843.86s)]
*  We have also shared our voice today. [[08:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28848.86s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... That was so beautiful. What the hell was that? [[08:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28850.86s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[08:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28859.86s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[08:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28861.86s)]
*  It was beautifully presented, but maybe I could hear what she said. [[08:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28863.86s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[08:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28870.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[08:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28872.86s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[08:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28874.86s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[08:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28876.86s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. I want to hear what she said. [[08:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28878.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[08:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28882.86s)]
*  The President, Prime Minister Maloney was asked whether, [[08:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28884.86s)]
*  what she thinks about the fact that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, [[08:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28888.86s)]
*  and Prime Minister Maloney answered, well, actually, we have... [[08:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28896.86s)]
*  No, and also, you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending, [[08:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28905.86s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that, no, actually, [[08:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28913.86s)]
*  we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[08:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28919.86s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[08:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28922.86s)]
*  and then we will see because we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... [[08:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28926.86s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[08:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28933.86s)]
*  I will do that. They've been asking if we decided another defense percentage about defense spending, [[08:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28935.86s)]
*  and I said, yes, NATO, and I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[08:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28943.86s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[08:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28950.86s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for the future, [[08:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28954.86s)]
*  and we see also the war that we are trying to do with the European left. [[08:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28959.86s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[08:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28964.86s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were President. [[08:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28974.86s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[08:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28978.86s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd have their beautiful terraces. [[08:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28981.86s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but they're not with us any longer. [[08:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28985.86s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[08:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28989.86s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[08:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28994.86s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[08:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=28998.86s)]
*  I think it's a war. I know it's a war. It didn't happen for four years. [[08:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29003.86s)]
*  It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[08:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29007.86s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. It was the apple of his eye, [[08:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29010.86s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were President. [[08:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29014.86s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[08:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29017.86s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[08:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29024.86s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars that... [[08:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29027.86s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[08:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29034.86s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[08:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29037.86s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that, and everybody agrees to it, [[08:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29039.86s)]
*  if I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[08:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29042.86s)]
*  I'm not blaming him, but what I am saying is that [[08:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29045.86s)]
*  I wouldn't say he's done the greatest job. [[08:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29049.86s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[08:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29052.86s)]
*  President Meloni, have you discussed the possibility of Europe being attacked by the Chinese? [[08:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29056.86s)]
*  Mr. President, are you sure about the definition of a parasite, of a European? [[08:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29070.86s)]
*  Could you say that again, that the Europeans are parasites? [[08:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29076.86s)]
*  He's never said that. [[08:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29079.86s)]
*  Have you ever said that the Europeans are parasites? [[08:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29080.86s)]
*  Yes. [[08:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29084.86s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[08:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29085.86s)]
*  No, I haven't seen it. I don't even know what you're talking about. [[08:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29086.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[08:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29089.86s)]
*  No, no, wait, wait. Next. Next. Go. [[08:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29093.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29098.86s)]
*  Prime Minister Meloni just said you want to make Europe great again, [[08:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29099.86s)]
*  and we want to do it together. [[08:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29103.86s)]
*  Sure. [[08:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29105.86s)]
*  Did you, I guess, that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister, [[08:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29106.86s)]
*  how are you going to do that? And are you looking to do it to counter China, [[08:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29110.86s)]
*  who is really trying to gather influence against the United States? [[08:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29115.86s)]
*  What is the power of this joint effort? [[08:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29120.86s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[08:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29122.86s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[08:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29125.86s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[08:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29129.86s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart because Europe is being very badly hurt [[08:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29134.86s)]
*  by what they've done with immigration. [[08:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29139.86s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[08:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29141.86s)]
*  And I commented to her before, I said, I wish more people would be like you [[08:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29147.86s)]
*  having to do with that subject, but they're not. [[08:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29151.86s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. [[08:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29155.86s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[08:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29159.86s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[08:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29161.86s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[08:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29165.86s)]
*  You've seen, you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, [[08:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29167.86s)]
*  let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[08:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29172.86s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning we were talking only about how we were redistributing [[08:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29175.86s)]
*  illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[08:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29180.86s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[08:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29182.86s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit and to return people. [[08:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29186.86s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[08:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29191.86s)]
*  So things are changing. [[08:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29197.86s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[08:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29199.86s)]
*  So they, we are working now together. [[08:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29206.86s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[08:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29210.86s)]
*  I hope so. [[08:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29212.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[08:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29215.86s)]
*  Go ahead. [[08:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29217.86s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romney, if you have discussed the option of a study [[08:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29219.86s)]
*  here with Italy on supply communications, and President Trump, [[08:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29223.86s)]
*  if you want to see the Google company... [[08:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29227.86s)]
*  The Google what? [[08:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29231.86s)]
*  The Google company. [[08:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29233.86s)]
*  What about it? [[08:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29234.86s)]
*  The Google business. [[08:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29235.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[08:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29237.86s)]
*  Well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[08:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29239.86s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[08:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29242.86s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[08:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29246.86s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[08:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29251.86s)]
*  Do you think that changing your mind potentially about tariffs and what you plan to do going forward? [[08:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29260.86s)]
*  I mean, I'm not sure if that's you. [[08:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29266.86s)]
*  Does that change your perspective? [[08:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29268.86s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[08:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29269.86s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden. [[08:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29271.86s)]
*  Trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[08:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29275.86s)]
*  And now that's, that whole tide has turned. [[08:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29279.86s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[08:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29282.86s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[08:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29284.86s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25% on cars, 25% on steel, 25% on aluminum, 10% baseline. [[08:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29285.86s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[08:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29293.86s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25% for allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak. [[08:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29296.86s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[08:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29307.86s)]
*  And we didn't do, we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[08:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29313.86s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China where we took in up until this point, probably $700 billion. [[08:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29318.86s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[08:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29324.86s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[08:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29326.86s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[08:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29328.86s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[08:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29329.86s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[08:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29331.86s)]
*  He did. [[08:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29333.86s)]
*  And so I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[08:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29334.86s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[08:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29338.86s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point, my tariffs on China. [[08:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29346.86s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[08:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29353.86s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[08:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29355.86s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[08:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29357.86s)]
*  So we're we're doing very well. [[08:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29360.86s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[08:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29363.86s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market. [[08:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29365.86s)]
*  But this is about that. [[08:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29372.86s)]
*  This is really we're building a base. [[08:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29374.86s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[08:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29376.86s)]
*  And again, I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far history of any country probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[08:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29378.86s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[08:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29387.86s)]
*  You know, I don't know exactly. [[08:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29389.86s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[08:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29401.86s)]
*  What do you think? [[08:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29402.86s)]
*  Where would it be signed and what? [[08:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29403.86s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[08:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29405.86s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 26th. [[08:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29407.86s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came together? [[08:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29409.86s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the president was here. [[08:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29413.86s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[08:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29419.86s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the I think it's an 80-take agreement. [[08:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29422.86s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[08:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29427.86s)]
*  I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[08:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29429.86s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[08:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29449.86s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[08:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29451.86s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[08:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29453.86s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[08:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29455.86s)]
*  Oil is great. [[08:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29458.86s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[08:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29460.86s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[08:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29462.86s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60, $65 range now per barrel. [[08:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29464.86s)]
*  And I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[08:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29470.86s)]
*  And food is down. [[08:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29475.86s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[08:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29478.86s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything is down. [[08:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29483.86s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[08:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29485.86s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[08:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29487.86s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[08:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29489.86s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact on that too. [[08:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29491.86s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[08:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29495.86s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[08:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29497.86s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[08:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29499.86s)]
*  It's hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. [[08:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29501.86s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[08:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29504.86s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[08:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29507.86s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[08:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29509.86s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down, and they have gone down a lot, [[08:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29511.86s)]
*  we've gotten it down really good. [[08:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29515.86s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[08:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29517.86s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.00 and $2.50 [[08:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29520.86s)]
*  instead of $4.50. [[08:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29525.86s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down. [[08:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29527.86s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[08:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29533.86s)]
*  That was really, it was not good. [[08:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29536.86s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7.00 or $8.00 because of their policy. [[08:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29538.86s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2.00. [[08:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29545.86s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[08:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29548.86s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[08:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29550.86s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[08:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29552.86s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[08:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29556.86s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[08:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29564.86s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[08:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29566.86s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[08:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29569.86s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[08:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29572.86s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[08:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29574.86s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[08:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29577.86s)]
*  Okay? [[08:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29581.86s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[08:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29582.86s)]
*  Please. [[08:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29586.86s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe and also, do you have a notice when you walk into the Netherlands? [[08:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29587.86s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best. [[08:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29593.86s)]
*  She's doing a great job. [[08:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29598.86s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, not just in Europe, anywhere. [[08:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29601.86s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[08:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29607.86s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[08:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29610.86s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[08:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29613.86s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[08:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29616.86s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[08:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29620.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29622.86s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[08:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29643.86s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[08:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29656.600000000002s)]
*  Tallahassee, active shooting. [[08:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29659.9s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[08:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29663.24s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. [[08:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29666.84s)]
*  It's a shame. [[08:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29669.58s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[08:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29670.88s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[08:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29671.82s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[08:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29675.32s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime [[08:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29678.56s)]
*  Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, [[08:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29680.92s)]
*  who's doing a fantastic job. [[08:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29684.76s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and [[08:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29687.4s)]
*  highly respected. [[08:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29691.56s)]
*  Everybody loves her and respects her. [[08:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29692.6s)]
*  And I can't say that about many people. [[08:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29695.4s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[08:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29698.14s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between [[08:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29700.46s)]

*  to remind that we both share another fight, which is the [[08:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29747.66s)]
*  fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like [[08:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29752.0s)]
*  to erase our history. [[08:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29757.84s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling [[08:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29760.02s)]
*  illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[08:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29765.22s)]
*  Italy has been one of the nation that made a plan [[08:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29770.9s)]
*  against fentanyl, for example. [[08:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29774.44s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral topics [[08:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29777.0s)]
*  and things that we can do together about defense, [[08:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29782.5s)]
*  about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[08:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29786.94s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also [[08:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29795.12s)]
*  nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[08:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29801.879999999997s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[08:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29804.12s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been [[08:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29807.8s)]
*  doing for many years. [[08:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29812.96s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 [[08:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29815.96s)]
*  billions. [[08:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29819.5s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[08:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29820.62s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[08:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29824.26s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[08:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29826.059999999998s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[08:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29830.44s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing [[08:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29836.719999999998s)]
*  in this week. [[08:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29841.72s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, [[08:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29843.32s)]
*  I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[08:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29845.72s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that when [[08:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29849.120000000003s)]
*  I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about [[08:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29852.86s)]
*  geographical space. [[08:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29855.48s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[08:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29856.960000000003s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[08:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29859.440000000002s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two [[08:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29861.64s)]
*  shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit [[08:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29866.9s)]
*  down and find solutions. [[08:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29871.3s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted [[08:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29872.96s)]
*  an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the [[08:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29877.28s)]
*  near future and consider the possibility in that occasion [[08:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29880.48s)]
*  to meet also with Europe. [[08:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29884.079999999998s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[08:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29887.28s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[08:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29890.76s)]
*  We can. [[08:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29892.42s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[08:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29894.219999999998s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[08:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29897.36s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime [[08:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29898.72s)]
*  Minister of Italy that today has very good as a very good [[08:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29901.600000000002s)]
*  situation despite the difficulties of stable country, [[08:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29908.4s)]
*  really reliable country, one million more jobs in the last [[08:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29911.08s)]
*  two years and a half. [[08:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29915.88s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[08:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29918.120000000003s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, [[08:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29919.5s)]
*  but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[08:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29923.48s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[08:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29926.28s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do [[08:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29929.68s)]
*  it even better together. [[08:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29932.12s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close together. [[08:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29933.68s)]
*  We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. [[08:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29936.039999999997s)]
*  We can build a just and lasting peace. [[08:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29938.199999999997s)]
*  We support your efforts. [[08:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29939.84s)]
*  Don't. [[08:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29941.559999999998s)]
*  Good. [[08:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29942.36s)]

*  to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[08:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29946.92s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[08:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29949.52s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[08:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29951.64s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, [[08:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29952.68s)]
*  mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[08:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29955.079999999998s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very [[08:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29958.399999999998s)]
*  good thing. [[08:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29960.88s)]

*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let [[08:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=29963.079999999998s)]

*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[08:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30105.480000000003s)]
*  The President. [[08:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30107.440000000002s)]
*  I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[08:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30109.08s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[08:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30111.36s)]

*  Yeah, please. [[08:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30115.2s)]
*  The Press. [[08:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30115.88s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of [[08:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30116.56s)]
*  cooperation you discussed with the foreign minister [[08:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30118.32s)]
*  in Italy and the United States and Europe? [[08:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30121.280000000002s)]
*  And on China? [[08:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30123.68s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[08:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30125.960000000003s)]
*  We're doing very well with negotiations, I think, [[08:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30127.44s)]
*  with all countries. [[08:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30130.2s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are [[08:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30131.88s)]
*  doing very well. [[08:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30135.72s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[08:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30136.48s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[08:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30139.68s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[08:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30141.88s)]
*  Would you say something? [[08:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30142.52s)]
*  Please. [[08:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30143.36s)]
*  The Press. [[08:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30144.02s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[08:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30144.68s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[08:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30148.76s)]
*  I believe they've been called with the EU already. [[08:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30153.0s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[08:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30156.24s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[08:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30159.12s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[08:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30163.68s)]
*  The President. [[08:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30165.12s)]
*  The Press. [[08:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30166.12s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think President Zelensky, [[08:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30167.12s)]
*  who is a member of China, is supplying weaponry or [[08:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30170.600000000002s)]
*  ammunition to Russia? [[08:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30174.36s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[08:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30176.24s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a minerals deal [[08:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30177.600000000002s)]
*  signed this week. [[08:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30180.280000000002s)]
*  Is that true? [[08:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30181.24s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is [[08:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30181.920000000002s)]
*  going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, and next [[08:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30183.72s)]
*  Thursday, soon. [[08:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30185.760000000002s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal. [[08:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30188.24s)]
*  So we'll see. [[08:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30190.6s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[08:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30191.3s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[08:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30195.04s)]
*  I have no idea. [[08:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30196.44s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[08:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30197.48s)]
*  The Press. [[08:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30199.4s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a report saying that you [[08:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30200.08s)]
*  waived off an Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear [[08:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30202.08s)]
*  facilities. [[08:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30204.72s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[08:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30205.38s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[08:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30206.28s)]
*  And they said the attack is what? [[08:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30208.28s)]
*  That you waived off an Israeli plan to attack [[08:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30209.920000000002s)]
*  Iranian nuclear facilities? [[08:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30212.8s)]
*  I wouldn't say waived off. [[08:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30215.0s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran [[08:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30216.079999999998s)]
*  has a chance to have a great country and to live [[08:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30219.64s)]
*  happily without death. [[08:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30223.64s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[08:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30225.739999999998s)]
*  That's my first option. [[08:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30226.739999999998s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be [[08:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30229.519999999997s)]
*  very bad for Iran. [[08:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30232.519999999997s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[08:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30234.76s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[08:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30239.059999999998s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[08:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30240.26s)]
*  I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future. [[08:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30242.76s)]
*  It'd do fantastically well. [[08:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30245.399999999998s)]
*  I know the Iranian people. [[08:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30248.16s)]
*  They're incredible people. [[08:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30249.359999999997s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very [[08:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30251.1s)]
*  successful people. [[08:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30253.78s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to [[08:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30255.699999999997s)]
*  hurt anybody. [[08:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30258.84s)]
*  I really don't. [[08:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30259.82s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[08:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30260.44s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[08:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30263.239999999998s)]
*  It's really simple. [[08:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30264.92s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[08:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30266.66s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[08:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30269.42s)]
*  We're not. [[08:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30272.52s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[08:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30273.18s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with [[08:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30275.68s)]
*  Obama, that deal would have expired already. [[08:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30278.72s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[08:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30281.460000000003s)]
*  It would have expired. [[08:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30282.56s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[08:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30285.32s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[08:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30288.460000000003s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[08:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30289.460000000003s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[08:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30290.9s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make [[08:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30292.940000000002s)]
*  short-term deals. [[08:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30295.9s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[08:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30296.9s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[08:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30299.44s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it [[08:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30302.34s)]
*  didn't allow us to do anything. [[08:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30304.48s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[08:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30305.84s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[08:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30307.739999999998s)]
*  Really. [[08:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30309.34s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[08:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30310.18s)]
*  But, no, I want — I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[08:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30313.68s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily, or [[08:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30318.28s)]
*  they can do it the other way. [[08:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30322.32s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[08:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30323.3s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[08:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30324.859999999997s)]
*  The Press. [[08:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30326.4s)]
*  Mr. President, why do you make up an idea of CEO [[08:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30327.4s)]
*  going to China and that would be very [[08:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30331.760000000002s)]
*  difficult there? [[08:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30333.4s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[08:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30334.74s)]

*  Mr. President, if we're all too content, will you [[08:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30344.780000000002s)]

*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to [[08:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30357.52s)]
*  speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[08:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30360.52s)]

*  millions of people — many millions of people during [[08:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30375.5s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[08:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30377.98s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[08:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30379.2s)]

*  away, but to get them out of our country. [[08:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30404.08s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority [[08:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30406.88s)]
*  away from a president. [[08:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30409.920000000002s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[08:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30411.22s)]
*  Tom Hulman, Kristi Noem — we have done an [[08:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30412.46s)]
*  amazing job. [[08:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30416.100000000002s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[08:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30416.88s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[08:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30419.18s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[08:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30420.58s)]
*  We have, right now, a 99 percent border. [[08:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30422.84s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[08:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30425.54s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be — nobody is [[08:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30427.16s)]
*  coming through our border, practically. [[08:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30428.96s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all [[08:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30432.18s)]
*  for medical reasons. [[08:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30434.36s)]
*  We allowed them. [[08:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30435.32s)]
*  We brought them through because one had a heart [[08:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30436.0s)]
*  attack, one had something else. [[08:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30438.5s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[08:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30441.2s)]
*  We have a great border. [[08:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30443.3s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a [[08:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30444.280000000002s)]
*  border now that's even tighter. [[08:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30447.52s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[08:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30449.22s)]
*  And, you know, we have to — we need to get murderers [[08:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30452.02s)]
*  and drug dealers and people that were in jail for horrible — [[08:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30457.46s)]
*  you know, they released jails — Georgia — from [[08:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30461.5s)]
*  all over the world and released them not just [[08:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30465.24s)]
*  South America, all over the world. [[08:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30467.98s)]
*  The Congo and Africa — many, many people come from [[08:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30469.48s)]
*  the Congo. [[08:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30472.780000000002s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[08:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30473.46s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their [[08:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30476.859999999997s)]
*  jails — Venezuela. [[08:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30479.559999999998s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[08:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30481.6s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent [[08:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30484.199999999997s)]
*  administration called the Biden administration. [[08:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30486.859999999997s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country — and [[08:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30491.16s)]
*  I was elected to straighten that out, and I'm doing that. [[08:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30494.699999999997s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers [[08:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30499.219999999998s)]
*  to be sent out of our country. [[08:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30502.68s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords [[08:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30504.38s)]
*  and people from mental institutions. [[08:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30507.62s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[08:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30510.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[08:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30512.22s)]
*  Maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it [[08:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30512.56s)]
*  nowadays, the progressive way. [[08:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30515.56s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[08:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30518.16s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[08:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30520.46s)]
*  Okay. [[08:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30522.06s)]
*  The Press. [[08:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30522.74s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these [[08:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30523.44s)]
*  deals will be done, but you also said that you're a no-brush. [[08:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30529.04s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[08:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30531.5s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[08:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30533.199999999997s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[08:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30534.6s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better. [[08:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30538.3s)]
*  Because if you were truthful — which you're not, you know, [[08:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30542.1s)]
*  I know you very well — you have gasoline that hit. [[08:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30544.579999999998s)]
*  At Dallin 98 yesterday, in a couple of states, [[08:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30549.84s)]
*  you have gasoline is way down. [[08:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30552.98s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[08:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30554.379999999997s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[08:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30558.4s)]
*  The price of eggs — you know, when I came in, [[08:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30561.600000000002s)]
*  they hit me with eggs. [[08:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30565.0s)]
*  I just got there. [[08:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30567.14s)]
*  I was here for one week, and they started screaming at me, [[08:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30567.9s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[08:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30570.14s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[08:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30571.82s)]
*  I was there for seven days, and I hear that eggs have gone [[08:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30573.58s)]
*  through the roof before I got there. [[08:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30576.82s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press — the fake news, [[08:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30578.960000000003s)]
*  like you, you're fake. [[08:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30581.52s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[08:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30583.06s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[08:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30586.760000000002s)]
*  This is my seventh day. [[08:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30588.22s)]
*  And they were right. [[08:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30590.68s)]
*  They went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[08:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30591.38s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[08:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30593.86s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[08:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30596.78s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[08:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30598.52s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[08:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30600.72s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place, [[08:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30602.2s)]
*  and the price went down 92 percent. [[08:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30604.22s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, [[08:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30607.3s)]
*  Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[08:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30609.8s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[08:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30613.44s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[08:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30615.2s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[08:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30616.58s)]
*  because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman [[08:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30619.82s)]
*  that is playing politics. [[08:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30621.92s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[08:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30624.96s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[08:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30628.06s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[08:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30630.64s)]
*  They should be coming down. [[08:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30632.2s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, [[08:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30634.3s)]
*  I guess, seven times. [[08:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30636.2s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again [[08:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30638.3s)]
*  and again. [[08:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30640.44s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[08:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30641.48s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[08:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30643.8s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, [[08:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30648.0s)]
*  but that's the only thing. [[08:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30649.56s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, [[08:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30650.46s)]
*  because they're not very smart people. [[08:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30653.2s)]
*  The Press. [[08:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30654.96s)]

*  Yes, sir. [[08:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30658.86s)]
*  Please. [[08:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30659.36s)]

*  Please. [[08:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30660.86s)]
*  Do you regret nominating him? [[08:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30661.36s)]
*  Jerome Howe? [[08:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30662.84s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we [[08:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30665.56s)]
*  had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[08:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30667.920000000002s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[08:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30670.2s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain, [[08:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30673.2s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration [[08:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30676.04s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[08:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30678.32s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[08:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30681.440000000002s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're taking in [[08:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30683.36s)]
*  are astronomical. [[08:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30687.2s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money [[08:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30688.32s)]
*  with the tariffs. [[08:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30690.36s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[08:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30691.72s)]
*  And the countries are having a hard time getting used [[08:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30694.440000000002s)]
*  to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore, [[08:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30697.8s)]
*  because we have a real president. [[08:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30699.96s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[08:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30701.96s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[08:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30705.8s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, [[08:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30710.04s)]
*  or they didn't like business, or it wasn't like a priority. [[08:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30711.84s)]
*  And then you had the last administration, [[08:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30715.68s)]
*  the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[08:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30717.44s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[08:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30720.02s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[08:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30721.079999999998s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[08:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30722.6s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[08:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30723.64s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[08:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30726.96s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[08:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30728.04s)]
*  You know why? [[08:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30730.32s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[08:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30731.82s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[08:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30734.08s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers [[08:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30736.16s)]
*  where this all happens. [[08:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30740.08s)]
*  It's happening now. [[08:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30741.32s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[08:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30742.2s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, [[08:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30743.920000000002s)]
*  we'll make the deal for them, [[08:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30745.56s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[08:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30747.2s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[08:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30748.52s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[08:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30750.84s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people [[08:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30752.44s)]
*  that are working on it that we're listening, [[08:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30759.68s)]
*  and we're going to be very fair to people. [[08:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30763.039999999997s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal, [[08:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30765.84s)]
*  and that's what we'll be doing. [[08:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30768.48s)]
*  Okay? [[08:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30770.079999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[08:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30772.359999999997s)]
*  Please. [[08:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30774.559999999998s)]
*  A question. [[08:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30775.32s)]
*  Our prime minister. [[08:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30776.559999999998s)]
*  Oh, you have a great prime minister. [[08:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30777.8s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[08:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30779.359999999997s)]
*  Yes. [[08:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30780.199999999997s)]
*  In Italian. [[08:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30780.699999999997s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[08:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30781.76s)]
*  Okay. [[08:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30782.6s)]
*  I'm not sure that they do it right. [[08:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30783.359999999997s)]
*  Presidente Meloni, [[08:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30785.12s)]
*  I'd like to know what you thought about the fact [[08:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30786.16s)]
*  that President Trump considered [[08:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30787.8s)]
*  the Zaleski responsible for Ukraine. [[08:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30790.44s)]
*  And then, if you talked about the spending in Italy, [[08:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30793.039999999997s)]
*  what are the maximum limits [[08:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30796.079999999998s)]
*  that he said could come to Italy, [[08:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30797.28s)]
*  the percentual spending in Italy? [[08:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30799.559999999998s)]
*  We talked about the maximum limits [[08:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30801.28s)]
*  that Italy could come to. [[08:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30802.84s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is keeping its commitments, [[08:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30803.879999999997s)]
*  because it will reach the next level of NATO, [[08:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30808.079999999998s)]
*  with the 2%, which was already planned, [[08:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30811.28s)]
*  which was signed by the previous governments, [[08:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30813.52s)]
*  because we are a serious nation, [[08:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30815.88s)]
*  but we didn't talk about how much this percentage will increase, [[08:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30818.04s)]
*  even if we are obviously aware [[08:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30822.2s)]
*  that the defense issue is a particularly important issue [[08:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30823.8s)]
*  of this time. [[08:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30826.88s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, [[08:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30827.559999999998s)]
*  as I think, [[08:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30828.84s)]
*  I think there was clearly an invasion, [[08:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30829.8s)]
*  and that the invader, from that point of view, [[08:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30834.88s)]
*  was Putin and Russia, [[08:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30837.559999999998s)]
*  but that's not what we're talking about today. [[08:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30839.92s)]
*  What reveals is the fact that, together, [[08:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30842.48s)]
*  we want to work, we are working [[08:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30845.0s)]
*  to try to achieve a peace in Ukraine [[08:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30847.16s)]
*  that can be just and lasting. [[08:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30849.28s)]
*  I think these are the efforts [[08:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30851.16s)]
*  on which we share our work. [[08:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30853.399999999998s)]
*  We have also shared our work today. [[08:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30856.079999999998s)]
*  President Trump, please introduce yourself. [[08:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30858.0s)]
*  I... That sounded absolutely... [[08:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30861.719999999998s)]
*  That was so beautiful. What the hell was that? [[08:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30865.0s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[08:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30868.12s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[08:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30870.399999999998s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[08:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30872.68s)]
*  But maybe I could hear what she said. [[08:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30875.079999999998s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[08:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30878.44s)]
*  Go ahead. [[08:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30880.32s)]
*  It was about asking... [[08:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30881.039999999997s)]
*  Hold it, hold it. [[08:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30883.039999999997s)]
*  Have some respect, please. [[08:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30884.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[08:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30885.64s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[08:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30886.6s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[08:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30888.399999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[08:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30891.44s)]
*  President, Prime Minister Malone was asked whether [[08:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30893.239999999998s)]
*  what she thinks about the fact that [[08:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30895.96s)]
*  President Trump holds Zelensky responsible [[08:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30898.04s)]
*  for the war in Ukraine. [[08:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30901.24s)]
*  And Prime Minister Malone answered, [[08:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30904.44s)]
*  well, actually, we have... [[08:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30906.88s)]
*  No, and also, if you talked about the military spending, [[08:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30913.64s)]
*  and the raising of the military spending, [[08:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30918.64s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Malone said is that, [[08:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30921.12s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise [[08:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30925.68s)]
*  of military spending. [[08:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30928.84s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2%, [[08:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30929.72s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware [[08:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30934.079999999998s)]
*  of the fact that it is very important to... [[08:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30936.6s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[08:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30940.6s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[08:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30941.44s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I will do that. [[08:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30942.28s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another [[08:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30943.239999999998s)]
*  defense percentage about the defense spending. [[08:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30946.28s)]
*  And I said, yes, NATO. [[08:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30950.92s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2% [[08:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30952.72s)]
*  as it was already decided. [[08:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30955.8s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[08:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30958.24s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important [[08:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30962.32s)]
*  for the future, and we see also the war [[08:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30966.44s)]
*  that we are trying to do at the European left. [[08:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30969.12s)]
*  And I don't hold... [[08:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30972.64s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible, [[08:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30973.920000000002s)]
*  but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact [[08:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30976.6s)]
*  that that war started. [[08:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30980.72s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started [[08:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30981.84s)]
*  if I were president. [[08:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30984.48s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now [[08:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30985.52s)]
*  that are dead. [[08:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30987.6s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[08:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30988.8s)]
*  and they'd have their beautiful turrets. [[08:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30991.04s)]
*  Those turrets are the most beautiful in the world, [[08:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30992.8s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[08:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30995.76s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, [[08:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30997.2s)]
*  laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[08:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=30999.92s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[08:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31002.6s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, [[08:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31005.92s)]
*  and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[08:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31009.28s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[08:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31011.4s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[08:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31012.56s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[08:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31013.600000000002s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[08:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31015.04s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[08:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31016.480000000003s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[08:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31018.4s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[08:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31020.640000000003s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in [[08:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31021.760000000002s)]
*  if I were president. [[08:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31024.04s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, [[08:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31025.120000000003s)]
*  because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[08:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31027.800000000003s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[08:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31032.480000000003s)]

*  and I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all and [[08:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31136.52s)]
*  I think they got to get smart because [[08:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31142.6s)]
*  Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've done with immigration now [[08:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31145.8s)]
*  I'll say this that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on [[08:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31149.5s)]
*  Immigration and I commented to her before I said I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject [[08:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31154.5s)]
*  But they're not [[08:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31161.26s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. Europe is very important to the world. I want Europe to do very well [[08:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31163.74s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration [[08:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31168.9s)]
*  But we are beginning to it doing it [[08:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31172.54s)]
*  You've seen you will see now the policies of the European Union in the last [[08:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31174.94s)]
*  Let's say two and a half years have been changing. Okay at the beginning we were talking all only about [[08:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31179.739999999998s)]
*  How we were redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy now [[08:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31185.3s)]
*  We are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration work with the countries of origin and transit [[08:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31189.66s)]
*  And to return people the European Commission just did the new rules about [[08:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31196.699999999997s)]
*  Repatriations and things like that. So things are changing [[08:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31202.58s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in low weight lowering the rates of illegal migration. So they [[08:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31207.02s)]
*  We are working now together. So I'm optimistic on that [[08:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31216.100000000002s)]
*  Communications and President Trump [[08:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31232.38s)]
*  The Google what [[08:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31238.98s)]
*  Well, we didn't discuss about about the starlink with this we've been discussing about [[08:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31246.18s)]
*  Defense space where we will work together also in the Mars missions [[08:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31252.14s)]
*  So there are big big things to do together, but we didn't discuss [[08:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31258.28s)]
*  No tariffs are making us rich we were [[08:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31275.36s)]
*  Losing a lot of money under Biden [[08:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31279.6s)]
*  trillions of dollars trillions on trade and [[08:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31282.12s)]
*  Now that's that whole tide has turned we're making a lot of money we're taking in a lot of money. Don't forget [[08:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31285.88s)]
*  We're taking in 25% on cars 25% on steel 25% on aluminum 10% baseline [[08:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31292.0s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. We put penalties on Mexico and Canada [[08:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31300.24s)]
*  25% for [[08:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31307.280000000002s)]
*  Allowing fentanyl and allowing the borders to be weak [[08:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31310.2s)]
*  Now we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you and [[08:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31314.08s)]
*  We didn't do we didn't take in anything before other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden [[08:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31320.52s)]
*  Which were the tariffs that put on China where we took in up and to this point probably seven hundred billion dollars [[08:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31325.84s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. He tried to weaken them [[08:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31332.56s)]
*  He did everything he could you know, he got paid money by China right family got paid money he did and [[08:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31335.84s)]
*  So, I don't know maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't but he tried to weaken them [[08:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31343.120000000003s)]
*  But he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets [[08:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31347.640000000003s)]
*  You know, they couldn't stand not doing it [[08:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31350.72s)]
*  But I took in in the up till this point my tariffs on China [[08:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31353.960000000003s)]
*  Nobody ever took in ten cents from China. No other president took in ten cents [[08:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31360.600000000002s)]
*  I took in more than seven hundred billion dollars from China. So we're [[08:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31364.5s)]
*  We're doing very well, I mean our country is doing very well they had a bad [[08:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31369.78s)]
*  Report today from one of the health care companies that had an impact on the stock market [[08:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31374.62s)]
*  But this is about that. This is really we're building a base. We're building a country like no other and again [[08:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31380.26s)]
*  I think I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far [[08:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31386.66s)]
*  History of any country probably but the history of our country in four years and I think this has a chance to be much better [[08:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31390.42s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm gonna leave that to Scott. What do you think? Where would it be signed and what? [[08:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31399.14s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the [[08:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31420.86s)]
*  President was here we had a numbering of understanding we went straight to the big deal and [[08:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31425.28s)]
*  The I think it's an 80-day agreement and that's what will be signed [[08:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31432.12s)]
*  Well, I think you should do the rate cuts because I think [[08:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31449.0s)]
*  If Europe has done it it puts us at a disadvantage to Europe, I mean he plays right into their hands [[08:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31452.760000000002s)]
*  So I think you should do the rate cuts. We don't have really inflation now [[08:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31459.02s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down oil is great [[08:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31462.4s)]
*  oil is way ahead of schedule and that's because of our policies, but oil is down into the [[08:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31467.68s)]
*  $60 $65 range now per barrel [[08:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31474.440000000002s)]
*  and I told you in certain states we have less than $2 for gasoline and [[08:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31478.100000000002s)]
*  Food is down groceries as we call it are down [[08:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31484.82s)]
*  Other than interest rates everything's down interest rates are pretty flat [[08:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31490.38s)]
*  They're not it's not that they're up, but we should be better than flat [[08:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31493.9s)]
*  We should if he would lower the interest rate I think would have a good impact on that too [[08:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31497.5s)]
*  But the costs are down. We have very little inflation [[08:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31502.08s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down when oh when [[08:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31505.78s)]
*  Biden came in oil went through the roof. That's what caused our problem that and is [[08:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31512.1s)]
*  very dumb spending but [[08:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31517.219999999998s)]
*  When the oil prices go down and they have gone down a lot. We've gotten it down [[08:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31519.94s)]
*  Really good. We've opened it up and we've gotten them down and that means that people driving cars are going to be paying [[08:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31524.579999999998s)]
*  $2 and $2 and 50 cents instead of [[08:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31530.86s)]
*  $4 and 50 cents and you know even at the end and they tried they tried just for the purpose of the election to get it down [[08:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31533.86s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. That was really it was not good, but [[08:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31540.9s)]
*  If they had won oil right now would be at seven or eight dollars [[08:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31547.7s)]
*  Because of their policy and we're gonna be at about two dollars [[08:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31551.86s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that and you're starting to see it [[08:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31556.18s)]
*  So, I don't know how you can have inflation when oil is has come down quite a bit and and [[08:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31559.579999999998s)]
*  I [[08:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31566.14s)]
*  Would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down [[08:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31567.379999999997s)]
*  that's the only thing he's good for and he would have an effect on that if he if he if he lowered him and I [[08:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31571.699999999997s)]
*  Think at some point he will he's gonna have a lot of political pressure, you know, they are [[08:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31578.179999999997s)]
*  Political also and I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates [[08:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31583.66s)]
*  I [[08:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31590.019999999997s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead please [[08:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31592.98s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains a prime minister cannot be our best [[08:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31601.1s)]
*  She's doing now. She's doing a great job. And yeah, it's certainly one of our great allies not just in Europe anywhere [[08:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31606.94s)]
*  Fantastic person and doing a great job and our relationship is is great and we have a lot of Italians in this country [[08:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31615.62s)]

*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now. It's a shame [[08:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31672.3s)]
*  Horrible thing horrible that things like this take place and we'll have more to say about it later [[08:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31677.739999999998s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime Minister of Italy with us [[08:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31684.899999999998s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney who's [[08:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31690.18s)]
*  Doing a fantastic job. I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and [[08:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31692.579999999998s)]
*  Highly respected everybody loves her and respects her and I can't say that about many people and [[08:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31698.18s)]

*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I I [[08:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31855.579999999998s)]
*  Know that when I speak about West mainly I don't speak about a geographical space. I speak about the civilization [[08:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31858.7s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. So I think even if we have some problems, okay [[08:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31865.7s)]

*  We've been defending the freedom of Ukraine together. We can build a just and lasting peace. We support your efforts [[08:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=31942.52s)]

*  I [[08:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32108.92s)]

*  You waved off [[08:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32216.6s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country and [[08:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32221.039999999997s)]

*  That's gonna hurt anybody. I really don't but [[08:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32264.84s)]
*  Iran can't have a nuclear weapons, you know pretty simple. It's really simple [[08:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32268.2s)]

*  The deal that was made the deal that was made with Obama that this deal would have expired already [[08:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32282.039999999997s)]
*  it was a terrible deal was it it was it would have expired and [[08:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32287.96s)]
*  That gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. I wouldn't have accepted [[08:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32292.28s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal number one. It was way too short [[08:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32296.219999999998s)]
*  You know when countries are involved you don't make short-term deals these are countries with long lives and [[08:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32299.280000000002s)]
*  I terminated that and it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything once it terminated [[08:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32306.440000000002s)]
*  You know what the deal was. It was a terrible deal [[08:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32313.56s)]

*  but no, I want I'd like to see Iran thrive and [[08:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32320.08s)]
*  They can do that. I think very easily or [[08:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32325.48s)]
*  They can do it the other way the other way is not going to be good for them. It'd be really bad for them [[08:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32328.72s)]

*  A big percentage of those are criminals serious criminals. I'm not saying just criminal because they came into the border illegally [[08:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32389.2s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level murderers [[08:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32396.2s)]
*  many of those people murdered more than one person and they're on the loose and [[09:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32400.440000000002s)]
*  I was elected to get rid of those criminals to get them out of our country [[09:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32405.760000000002s)]
*  Or to put them away, but to get them out of our country [[09:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32409.960000000003s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president [[09:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32413.04s)]
*  We've done an amazing job Tom Holman [[09:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32417.88s)]
*  Christine Ohm that we have done an amazing job. Nobody can believe the job we've done far greater than what I said [[09:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32420.68s)]
*  I mean I got elected on that but we've done much better. We have right now 99% border. It's a 99% [[09:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32427.239999999998s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be but nobody's coming through our border practically [[09:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32433.719999999998s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through all for medical reasons [[09:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32438.559999999998s)]
*  We allowed them we brought them through because one had a heart attack one had something else [[09:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32442.04s)]
*  all for medical reasons [[09:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32447.84s)]
*  We have a great border. We had a great border four years ago [[09:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32449.68s)]
*  but we have a border now that's even tighter and we did that in a matter of weeks and [[09:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32453.2s)]
*  No, we have to we need [[09:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32460.079999999998s)]
*  We need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that were in jail for horrible. You know, they released jails [[09:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32462.64s)]
*  Georgia from all over the world and release them not just South America all over the world the Congo and Africa [[09:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32471.32s)]
*  Many many people come from the Congo. I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo and [[09:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32478.04s)]
*  All over the world they came in open their jails Venezuela [[09:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32483.68s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country [[09:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32488.36s)]
*  we took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration and [[09:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32490.96s)]
*  To think what they've done to our country and I was elected to straighten that out and I'm doing that [[09:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32498.079999999998s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country [[09:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32505.559999999998s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions [[09:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32511.079999999998s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country. I guess I don't know [[09:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32516.739999999998s)]
*  Maybe that's the liberal way or as they call it nowadays the progressive way [[09:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32519.239999999998s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes and that's why I wanted a landslide [[09:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32524.559999999998s)]
*  We're confident these deals will be done, but you also said that you're a no-brainer [[09:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32534.76s)]
*  Americans are saying prices rise or taking on their bills. How long can they expect that? [[09:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32538.199999999997s)]
*  so [[09:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32544.719999999998s)]
*  They've already seen it get much better [[09:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32545.96s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well [[09:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32548.679999999997s)]

*  I was here for one week and they started screaming me eggs have gone through the roof [[09:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32574.6s)]
*  I said I just got here [[09:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32578.44s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there and [[09:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32579.719999999998s)]
*  They were screaming at me the press the fake news like you you're fake and the fake news is screaming at me like [[09:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32585.48s)]
*  About eggs I said I've only been here. I just this is my seventh day and they were right [[09:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32592.6s)]
*  They went up eighty seven percent and you couldn't get them [[09:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32598.04s)]
*  They said you won't have eggs for Easter which is coming up. Happy Easter everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter [[09:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32600.6s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job and now eggs of all over the place and the price went down 92 percent [[09:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32607.079999999998s)]
*  and our commissioner of agriculture [[09:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32613.64s)]
*  Brooke has done a [[09:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32616.32s)]
*  Fantastic job didn't really have done a fast job [[09:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32619.239999999998s)]
*  So prices ever gonna the only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates because we have a federal reserve chairman that [[09:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32621.96s)]
*  is playing politics [[09:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32629.399999999998s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of actually but he's playing politics [[09:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32631.719999999998s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. They should be coming down [[09:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32637.32s)]
*  In europe as you know, they reduce them [[09:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32641.0s)]
*  I guess seven times. It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again, but our guy wants to play cute [[09:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32643.879999999997s)]
*  But [[09:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32650.280000000002s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty much even maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing but that's because of the Federal Reserve [[09:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32652.48s)]
*  Because they're not very smart people [[09:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32659.800000000003s)]
*  Look in the first four years we had the greatest economy in the history of our country stock market went up 88 points [[09:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32672.04s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration economically in the history of our country [[09:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32679.88s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see [[09:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32688.120000000003s)]
*  That the numbers that we're taking in are astronomical. We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs [[09:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32691.88s)]
*  we were treated very unfairly on trade and [[09:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32698.440000000002s)]
*  Countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that to us anymore because we have [[09:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32702.440000000002s)]
*  A real president we have a president that understands [[09:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32707.72s)]
*  What it's all about. We had presidents that in some cases [[09:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32711.480000000003s)]
*  Were smart, but they didn't understand business or they didn't like business or you know, it wasn't like a priority [[09:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32715.88s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections [[09:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32722.36s)]
*  That's about all they could do they couldn't do anything that were useless. They were incompetent worst administration in the history of our [[09:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32726.68s)]
*  Country worse than jimmy carter jimmy carter died a happy man [[09:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32732.84s)]
*  You know why? [[09:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32737.0s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president joe biden was [[09:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32738.440000000002s)]
*  so [[09:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32742.920000000002s)]
*  I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. It's happening now [[09:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32744.600000000002s)]
*  I mean everybody wants to make a deal and if they don't want to make a deal [[09:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32748.920000000002s)]
*  We'll make the deal for them because that's what's going to happen. We're just saying [[09:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32752.28s)]
*  This is what it is, but we want to listen to everybody and I I think [[09:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32756.600000000002s)]
*  I think [[09:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32760.68s)]
*  I think I can [[09:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32762.440000000002s)]
*  I think I can say for scott and the other people that are working on it [[09:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32763.96s)]
*  that uh, we're listening and [[09:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32767.96s)]
*  We're going to be very fair to people but you know, we're the one that really sets the deal and that's what we'll be doing [[09:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32770.92s)]
*  You go ahead please [[09:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32778.84s)]
*  Oh, you have a great prime minister you're so lucky yes [[09:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32784.44s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's right. Okay. I'm not sure they're the one [[09:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32788.2s)]
*  Okay [[09:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32794.2s)]
*  Italy [[09:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32809.88s)]
*  Italy is keeping its commitments because it will reach the next [[09:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32811.88s)]
*  peak of NATO with the 2% that was already planned, [[09:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32816.24s)]
*  which was signed by the previous governments, [[09:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32820.24s)]
*  because we are a serious nation, but we have not talked about [[09:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32822.64s)]
*  how much this percentage will increase, [[09:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32826.04s)]
*  even if we are obviously aware that the theme of defense is [[09:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32829.04s)]
*  a particularly important theme of this time. [[09:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32832.04s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, [[09:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32834.439999999995s)]
*  I think that there was clearly an invasion, [[09:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32836.8s)]
*  and that the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, [[09:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32841.8s)]
*  but that is not what reveals today that together we want to work, [[09:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32846.8s)]
*  we are working to try to achieve in Ukraine a peace that can be [[09:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32852.8s)]
*  just and lasting. [[09:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32856.8s)]

*  we have also shared our voice today. [[09:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=32862.8s)]

*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, other than the tariffs that I put [[09:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33327.439999999995s)]
*  on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China, where we took in — up until [[09:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33331.159999999996s)]
*  this point, probably $700 billion. [[09:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33336.34s)]

*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[09:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33367.740000000005s)]

*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[09:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33371.3s)]
*  So we're doing very well. [[09:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33374.94s)]

*  They had a bad report today from one of the healthcare companies that had an impact on [[09:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33379.9s)]

*  We're building a country like no other. [[09:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33390.74s)]

*  History of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[09:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33397.7s)]

*  What do you think? [[09:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33416.74s)]
*  Where would it be signed and when? [[09:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33417.74s)]
*  Q We're still working on the details. [[09:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33418.74s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 26. [[09:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33419.74s)]
*  Q Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how [[09:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33420.74s)]
*  it came together? [[09:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33421.74s)]
*  Q It's substantially what we agreed on previously. [[09:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33422.74s)]
*  But the president was here. [[09:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33423.74s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[09:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33424.74s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal and the — I think it's an 80-page agreement. [[09:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33425.74s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[09:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33426.74s)]
*  Q President Trump, on rate cuts, can you clarify — can you clarify on rate cuts? [[09:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33427.74s)]
*  Q I think it's a big deal. [[09:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33428.74s)]
*  I think it's a big deal. [[09:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33429.74s)]
*  I think it's a big deal. [[09:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33430.74s)]
*  Q Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it, it [[09:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33431.74s)]
*  puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[09:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33462.02s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[09:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33463.02s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[09:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33466.259999999995s)]
*  We don't have really inflation now. [[09:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33467.759999999995s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[09:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33469.5s)]
*  Oil is great. [[09:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33473.06s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[09:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33474.06s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[09:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33477.02s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60 — $65 range now per barrel. [[09:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33479.02s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[09:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33485.5s)]
*  And food is down. [[09:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33490.78s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[09:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33493.340000000004s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[09:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33497.78s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[09:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33499.76s)]
*  They're not — it's not that they're up. [[09:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33500.76s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[09:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33503.060000000005s)]
*  We should — if he would lower the interest rate, I think we'd have a good impact on [[09:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33504.42s)]
*  that too. [[09:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33508.54s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[09:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33509.54s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[09:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33511.46s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[09:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33512.62s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down and oil goes down. [[09:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33514.700000000004s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[09:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33518.740000000005s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[09:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33521.62s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[09:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33523.060000000005s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down — and they have gone down a lot. [[09:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33526.280000000006s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[09:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33530.22s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[09:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33532.3s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2 and $2.50 instead of [[09:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33534.86s)]
*  $4.50. [[09:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33540.020000000004s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried — they tried just for the purpose of the [[09:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33541.020000000004s)]
*  election to get it down. [[09:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33546.3s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[09:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33548.82s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[09:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33550.92s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[09:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33553.479999999996s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[09:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33560.799999999996s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[09:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33562.84s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[09:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33565.28s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[09:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33566.86s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[09:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33572.880000000005s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[09:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33578.68s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[09:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33580.880000000005s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[09:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33584.0s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[09:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33586.920000000006s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[09:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33588.520000000004s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[09:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33591.98s)]
*  Okay? [[09:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33595.520000000004s)]

*  that comes from Grifo. [[09:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33743.28s)]
*  You know today is April 17th, and April 17th marks the anniversary of the agreement that [[09:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33744.96s)]
*  allowed Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[09:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33752.72s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties are, but also to remind that we both share [[09:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33756.36s)]
*  another fight, which is the fight against the walk and ADI ideology that would like [[09:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33764.0s)]
*  to erase our history. [[09:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33771.36s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on tackling illegal migration, on fighting [[09:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33773.76s)]
*  against synthetic drugs. [[09:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33782.56s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan against fentanyl, for example. [[09:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33784.0s)]
*  We have been talking about many bilateral topics and things that we can do together [[09:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33790.8s)]
*  about defense, about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[09:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33798.32s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports. [[09:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33809.04s)]
*  And also nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[09:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33815.04s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[09:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33817.68s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been doing for many years. [[09:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33821.52s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 billions. [[09:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33829.6s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[09:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33834.32s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[09:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33837.96s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[09:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33839.44s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[09:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33844.08s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing in this week. [[09:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33849.36s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me, I was saying it before, such a Western [[09:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33857.200000000004s)]
*  nationalism. [[09:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33861.76s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word. [[09:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33862.76s)]
*  But I know that when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about geographical space. [[09:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33864.48s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[09:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33870.520000000004s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[09:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33873.16s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two shores of the Atlantic, it is the [[09:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33875.4s)]
*  time that we try to sit down and find solutions. [[09:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33882.240000000005s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted an invitation to pay an official [[09:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33886.64s)]
*  visit to Rome in the near future. [[09:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33892.64s)]
*  And consider the possibility in that occasion to meet also with Europe. [[09:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33895.4s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[09:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33900.92s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[09:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33904.439999999995s)]
*  We can. [[09:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33906.04s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[09:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33907.04s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[09:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33911.52s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime Minister of Italy that today has [[09:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33912.52s)]
*  very good, has a very good situation despite the difficulties, a stable country, a reliable [[09:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33919.92s)]
*  country, one million more jobs in the last two years and a half. [[09:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33925.52s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[09:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33931.520000000004s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[09:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33933.200000000004s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60 percent. [[09:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33939.92s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it even better together. [[09:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33943.4s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[09:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33947.520000000004s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[09:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33949.520000000004s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[09:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33951.68s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[09:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33953.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[09:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33955.520000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[09:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33956.520000000004s)]
*  And I think we're doing well in that effort, but we want to get it done and we'll see if [[09:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33958.32s)]
*  we can. [[09:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33962.56s)]
*  We want to save on average. [[09:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33963.56s)]
*  Think of it every week. [[09:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33965.399999999994s)]
*  Two thousand five hundred people are being killed, mostly soldiers, Russian, Ukrainian [[09:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33966.399999999994s)]
*  soldiers. [[09:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33970.52s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that would be a very good thing. [[09:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33971.52s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[09:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33975.24s)]
*  And I think we're getting close, but we'll we'll let you know very soon. [[09:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=33976.719999999994s)]

*  He says he won't leave even if you ask him to. [[09:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34016.64s)]
*  Oh, he'll leave. [[09:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34019.64s)]

*  And I was elected because of the fact I would say maybe that was the number one factor. [[09:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34074.8s)]
*  A lot of reasons. [[09:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34079.8s)]
*  The economy, a lot of things. [[09:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34080.8s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected is because I said, I'm going to get the criminals [[09:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34081.8s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country so stupidly through open borders. [[09:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34086.8s)]
*  I'm going to get them out. [[09:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34091.8s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, record setting numbers of votes. [[09:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34092.8s)]
*  As you know, we won everything. [[09:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34097.880000000005s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states. [[09:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34098.880000000005s)]
*  We won everything. [[09:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34101.880000000005s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted. [[09:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34102.880000000005s)]
*  That's what I'm doing. [[09:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34104.880000000005s)]
*  But you have to speak to the lawyers because it's up to them. [[09:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34105.880000000005s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you think of the proposal from France and the UK of a peace mission [[09:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34108.880000000005s)]
*  in Ukraine with soldiers? [[09:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34115.880000000005s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[09:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34118.880000000005s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[09:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34121.880000000005s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[09:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34124.880000000005s)]
*  Good with me. [[09:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34126.96s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[09:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34127.96s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[09:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34128.96s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed what areas of cooperation you discussed with the Prime [[09:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34129.96s)]
*  Minister? [[09:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34134.96s)]
*  Is it Italy, the United States, and Europe? [[09:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34135.96s)]
*  And China? [[09:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34138.96s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[09:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34139.96s)]
*  Now, we're doing very well with negotiations, I think, with all countries. [[09:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34140.96s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, but we are doing very well. [[09:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34144.96s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that want to make a deal. [[09:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34149.96s)]
*  Frankly, they want to make deals more than I do. [[09:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34152.96s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott. [[09:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34154.96s)]
*  Would you say something, please? [[09:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34156.04s)]
*  Yeah, we've been a process in place. [[09:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34157.04s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[09:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34159.04s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[09:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34162.04s)]
*  I believe it's been called with the EU already. [[09:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34166.04s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[09:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34169.04s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking. [[09:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34172.04s)]
*  That's moving very quickly. [[09:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34176.04s)]
*  Mr. President, we have a great deal of cooperation with the United States. [[09:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34179.04s)]
*  Do you have any evidence from China that they're supplying weapons or ammunition to Russia? [[09:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34182.12s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[09:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34189.12s)]
*  And also, you said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[09:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34192.12s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, which I guess is going to be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[09:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34195.12s)]
*  next Thursday. [[09:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34199.12s)]
*  And I assume they're going to live up to the deal, so we'll see. [[09:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34202.12s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[09:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34205.12s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[09:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34208.12s)]
*  I have no idea. [[09:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34210.200000000004s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[09:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34211.200000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, there was a question about the Israeli attack on Iranian nuclear facilities. [[09:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34214.200000000004s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[09:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34219.200000000004s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[09:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34220.200000000004s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[09:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34221.200000000004s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[09:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34223.200000000004s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[09:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34228.200000000004s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[09:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34229.200000000004s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[09:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34235.28s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[09:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34238.28s)]
*  That's my first option. [[09:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34240.28s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[09:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34242.28s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[09:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34247.28s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[09:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34251.28s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[09:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34253.28s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, do fantastically well. [[09:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34255.28s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[09:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34260.36s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, very successful people. [[09:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34263.36s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything that's going to hurt anybody. [[09:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34268.36s)]
*  I really don't. [[09:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34272.36s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[09:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34273.36s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[09:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34276.36s)]
*  It's really simple. [[09:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34277.36s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[09:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34278.36s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[09:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34281.36s)]
*  We're not always saying, you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[09:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34284.36s)]
*  The deal that was made, the deal that was made with Obama, [[09:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34287.44s)]
*  that deal would have expired already. [[09:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34290.44s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[09:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34292.44s)]
*  It would have expired. [[09:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34294.44s)]
*  And that gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[09:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34296.44s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted it. [[09:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34299.44s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[09:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34300.44s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[09:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34302.44s)]
*  You know, when countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[09:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34304.44s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[09:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34308.44s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[09:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34310.44s)]
*  And it was a great termination. [[09:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34313.44s)]
*  And it was a great termination because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[09:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34315.520000000004s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[09:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34319.520000000004s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[09:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34321.520000000004s)]
*  Really. [[09:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34322.520000000004s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the U.S. [[09:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34323.520000000004s)]
*  But no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[09:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34326.520000000004s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily. [[09:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34330.520000000004s)]
*  Or they can do it the other way. [[09:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34334.520000000004s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[09:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34336.520000000004s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[09:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34338.520000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, what do you think of the video CEO going to China and met with trade officials there? [[09:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34340.6s)]
*  Well, Jensen's an amazing guy. [[09:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34347.6s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[09:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34349.6s)]
*  And I don't know, he's a person that's very proud of our country. [[09:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34351.6s)]
*  He loves our country. [[09:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34355.6s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[09:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34356.6s)]
*  Mr. President, if we're all doing content, will you take steps to return Kilmar Abrego-Garcia to the United States and put him in front of a judge? [[09:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34358.6s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[09:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34369.68s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[09:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34370.68s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[09:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34376.68s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[09:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34378.68s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated by millions of people, many millions of people during the Biden administration. [[09:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34383.68s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[09:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34392.68s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, serious criminals. [[09:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34394.76s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals because they came into the border illegally. [[09:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34399.76s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals at the highest level, murderers. [[09:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34402.76s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person and they're on the loose. [[09:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34406.76s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, to get them out of our country or to put them away, but to get them out of our country. [[09:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34411.76s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority away from a president. [[09:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34419.840000000004s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. Tom Holman, Kristi Noem. [[09:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34424.840000000004s)]
*  We have done an amazing job. [[09:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34428.840000000004s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[09:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34430.840000000004s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[09:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34432.840000000004s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, but we've done much better. [[09:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34434.840000000004s)]
*  We have right now 99 percent border. [[09:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34436.840000000004s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[09:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34438.840000000004s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, nobody's coming through our border practically. [[09:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34440.840000000004s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, all for medical reasons. [[09:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34444.840000000004s)]
*  We allowed them. We brought them through because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[09:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34448.92s)]
*  All for medical reasons. [[09:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34453.92s)]
*  We have a great border. [[09:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34455.92s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[09:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34457.92s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[09:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34462.92s)]
*  And, you know, we have to, we need, we need to get murderers and drug dealers and people that were in jail for horrible. [[09:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34464.92s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, from all over the world and released them, not just South America, all over the world. [[09:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34475.0s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[09:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34483.0s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[09:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34485.0s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[09:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34487.0s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, opened their jails. Venezuela. [[09:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34490.0s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners released into our country. [[09:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34495.0s)]
*  We took them because we had an incompetent administration called the Biden administration. [[09:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34498.0s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[09:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34504.08s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[09:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34507.08s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[09:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34510.08s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers to be sent out of our country. [[09:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34512.08s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords and people from mental institutions. [[09:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34518.08s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[09:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34523.08s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[09:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34525.08s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes, and that's why I wanted a landslide. [[09:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34531.16s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident these deals would be done, but you also said that you're in no rush. [[09:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34536.16s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. They're seeing it on their bills. [[09:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34545.16s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[09:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34548.16s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better. [[09:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34552.16s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, you know, I know you very well, [[09:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34555.16s)]
*  you have gasoline that hit a dollar and 98 yesterday in a couple of states. [[09:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34560.240000000005s)]
*  You have gasoline's way down. The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[09:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34566.240000000005s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[09:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34571.240000000005s)]
*  The price of eggs. You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[09:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34574.240000000005s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week and they started screaming, [[09:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34580.240000000005s)]
*  Eggs have gone through the roof! [[09:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34583.240000000005s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[09:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34585.240000000005s)]
*  I was there for seven days and I hear that eggs have gone through the roof before I got there. [[09:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34587.32s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, the fake news like you, you're fake. [[09:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34592.32s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, about eggs. [[09:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34596.32s)]
*  I said, I've only been here, this is my seventh day. [[09:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34600.32s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent and you couldn't get them. [[09:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34603.32s)]
*  They said, you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[09:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34607.32s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. You won't have eggs for Easter. [[09:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34610.32s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[09:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34613.4s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place and the price went down 92 percent. [[09:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34615.4s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[09:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34620.4s)]
*  They've really done a fantastic job. [[09:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34626.4s)]
*  So price is never going to... [[09:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34628.4s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up actually is interest rates. [[09:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34629.4s)]
*  Because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman that is playing politics. [[09:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34632.4s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of actually. [[09:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34637.4s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[09:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34640.48s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[09:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34643.48s)]
*  They should be coming down. [[09:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34645.48s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[09:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34647.48s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and again and again. [[09:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34651.48s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[09:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34654.48s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[09:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34656.48s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the only thing. [[09:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34660.48s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because they're not very smart people. [[09:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34663.48s)]
*  Go ahead. [[09:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34668.560000000005s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[09:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34671.560000000005s)]
*  Please. [[09:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34672.560000000005s)]
*  Go ahead. [[09:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34673.560000000005s)]
*  Please. [[09:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34674.560000000005s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[09:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34675.560000000005s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[09:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34683.560000000005s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because we had the most successful administration [[09:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34686.560000000005s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[09:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34691.560000000005s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time because you will see that the numbers [[09:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34694.64s)]
*  that we're taking in are astronomical. [[09:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34699.64s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money with the tariffs. [[09:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34701.64s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[09:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34704.64s)]
*  And countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact that they can't do that [[09:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34707.64s)]
*  to us anymore because we have a real president. [[09:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34712.64s)]
*  We have a president that understands what it's all about. [[09:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34715.64s)]
*  We had presidents that, in some cases, were smart, but they didn't understand business [[09:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34718.72s)]
*  or they didn't like business or, you know, it wasn't like a priority. [[09:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34723.72s)]
*  And then you had like the last administration, the only thing they were good at was cheating [[09:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34727.72s)]
*  in elections. [[09:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34731.72s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[09:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34732.72s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[09:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34733.72s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[09:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34734.72s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[09:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34735.72s)]
*  Worse than Jimmy Carter. [[09:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34738.72s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[09:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34740.72s)]
*  You know why? [[09:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34742.72s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst president. [[09:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34743.72s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[09:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34746.8s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers when this all happens. [[09:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34749.8s)]
*  It's happening now. [[09:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34754.8s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[09:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34755.8s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the deal for them. [[09:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34757.8s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[09:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34760.8s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[09:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34761.8s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[09:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34764.8s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people that are working on it that we're [[09:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34766.8s)]
*  listening and we're going to be very fair to people. [[09:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34775.880000000005s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal. [[09:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34778.880000000005s)]
*  And that's what we'll be doing. [[09:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34781.880000000005s)]
*  Okay? [[09:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34783.880000000005s)]

*  A question. [[09:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34786.880000000005s)]
*  Today, our Prime Minister. [[09:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34787.880000000005s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[09:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34790.880000000005s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[09:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34792.880000000005s)]
*  Good. [[09:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34793.880000000005s)]
*  In Italian? [[09:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34794.880000000005s)]
*  Oh, yes. [[09:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34795.880000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[09:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34796.880000000005s)]
*  Okay. [[09:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34797.880000000005s)]
*  I'm not sure that would be. [[09:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34798.880000000005s)]
*  Presidente Benoni, I want to know what you thought of the fact that President Trump considered [[09:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34799.880000000005s)]
*  the possibility of working with Ukraine. [[09:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34804.96s)]
*  And then, if you talked about the expenses in Italy, what is the maximum limit that he [[09:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34807.96s)]
*  said that Italy can reach, the percentage of the expenses in Italy? [[09:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34812.96s)]
*  We talked about the maximum limit that Italy can reach. [[09:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34815.96s)]
*  We talked about the fact that Italy is keeping its commitments because it will reach the next [[09:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34818.96s)]
*  NATO vertex with the 2%, which was already planned, which was signed by the previous [[09:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34823.96s)]
*  governments. [[09:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34828.96s)]
*  We are a serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this percentage will increase, [[09:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34830.04s)]
*  even if we are obviously aware that the issue of defense is a particularly important [[09:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34835.04s)]
*  issue at this time. [[09:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34839.04s)]
*  As for the war in Ukraine, as I think, I think there was clearly an invasion, [[09:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34841.04s)]
*  and the invader from that point of view was Putin and Russia, but that's not what [[09:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34848.04s)]
*  we're talking about. [[09:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34855.12s)]
*  Today what reveals is the fact that together we want to work, we are working to try to [[09:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34856.12s)]
*  reach a peace in Ukraine that can be just and lasting. [[09:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34861.12s)]
*  I think these are the efforts we are making to share our work. [[09:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34864.12s)]
*  We have also shared our voice today. [[09:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34869.12s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... [[09:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34875.12s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[09:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34878.12s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[09:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34880.12s)]

*  The President, Prime Minister Maroney was asking whether, what she thinks about the [[09:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34904.200000000004s)]
*  fact that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the war in Ukraine, and Prime Minister [[09:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34909.28s)]
*  Maroney answered, well, actually we have... [[09:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34919.28s)]
*  And also you talked about the military spending and the raising of the military spending, [[09:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34928.28s)]
*  and the first thing Prime Minister Maroney said is that no, actually we didn't talk about [[09:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34935.36s)]
*  the raise of military spending. [[09:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34942.36s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, and then we will see, because [[09:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34943.36s)]
*  we are absolutely aware of the fact that it is very important to... [[09:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34948.36s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[09:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34953.36s)]

*  I will do that. [[09:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34956.36s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided on a defense percentage about the defense spending, and [[09:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34957.36s)]
*  I said, yes, NATO. [[09:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34964.44s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it was already decided. [[09:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34965.44s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, but we are aware of the fact that [[09:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34970.44s)]
*  defense is important for the future, and we see also the war that we are trying to do [[09:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34977.44s)]
*  at the European level. [[09:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34984.44s)]
*  I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact that that [[09:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34987.520000000004s)]
*  war started. [[09:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34994.72s)]

*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[09:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=34999.240000000005s)]

*  I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[09:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35032.12s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, but there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were [[09:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35034.16s)]
*  President. [[09:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35037.920000000006s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, Russia's a lot bigger. [[09:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35038.920000000006s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[09:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35046.36s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in wars. [[09:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35049.0s)]
*  You can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[09:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35055.56s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[09:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35058.64s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — if I were President, that [[09:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35060.439999999995s)]

*  The Prime Minister just said you want to make Europe great again, and we want to do [[09:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35119.84s)]
*  it together. [[09:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35124.84s)]
*  Together, in the West. [[09:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35125.84s)]
*  Did you — I guess that's what you said. [[09:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35126.84s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, how are you going to do that? [[09:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35130.479999999996s)]
*  And are you looking to do it — to counter China, who is really trying to gather influence [[09:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35133.479999999996s)]
*  against the United States? [[09:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35140.479999999996s)]
*  What are the health benefits you're talking about? [[09:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35141.479999999996s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[09:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35144.479999999996s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, and a lot of it's having to do with immigration. [[09:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35146.479999999996s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe and what they've done with immigration at all. [[09:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35151.479999999996s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, because Europe is being very badly hurt by what they've [[09:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35157.12s)]
*  done with immigration. [[09:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35162.12s)]
*  Now, I'll say this, that the Prime Minister has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[09:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35163.12s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[09:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35170.12s)]
*  I said, I wish more people would be like you having to do with that subject. [[09:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35171.12s)]
*  But they're not. [[09:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35175.12s)]
*  Europe is very important to me. [[09:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35178.12s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[09:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35179.12s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[09:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35181.12s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[09:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35183.76s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it. [[09:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35186.76s)]
*  You've seen — you've all seen how the policies of the European Union in the last, let's say, [[09:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35188.76s)]
*  two and a half years have been changing. [[09:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35193.76s)]
*  Okay. [[09:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35195.76s)]
*  At the beginning, we were talking only about how we were redistributing illegal migrants [[09:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35196.76s)]
*  coming to Italy. [[09:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35201.76s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, work with the countries [[09:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35202.76s)]
*  of origin and transit, and to return people. [[09:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35208.76s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about repatriations and things like that. [[09:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35212.4s)]
*  So things are changing, thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the [[09:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35218.4s)]
*  rates of illegal migration. [[09:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35225.4s)]
*  So they — we are working now together. [[09:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35228.4s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[09:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35231.4s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[09:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35234.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[09:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35237.04s)]
*  I'd like to ask — I'd like to ask President De Bonita if you have discussed the option [[09:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35239.04s)]
*  of starting here with Italy on supply communications. [[09:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35244.04s)]
*  And to President Trump, if you want to see the Google company — [[09:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35247.04s)]
*  The Google what? [[09:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35252.04s)]
*  The Google company. [[09:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35254.04s)]
*  What about — [[09:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35255.04s)]
*  The Google business. [[09:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35256.04s)]
*  I want to see the Google company. [[09:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35257.04s)]
*  It's a great — [[09:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35258.04s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[09:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35259.04s)]
*  We didn't discuss about Starlink. [[09:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35260.68s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[09:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35263.68s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[09:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35267.68s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, but we didn't discuss it. [[09:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35271.68s)]
*  Did you have any other reasons, Prime Minister, that changed your mind potentially about terrorists [[09:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35280.68s)]
*  and what you plan to do going forward? [[09:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35285.68s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[09:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35288.32s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden — trillions of dollars, trillions — on [[09:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35291.32s)]
*  trade. [[09:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35298.32s)]
*  And now that's — that whole tide has turned. [[09:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35299.32s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[09:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35302.32s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[09:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35304.32s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, 25 percent on steel, 25 percent on [[09:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35305.32s)]
*  aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[09:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35311.32s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[09:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35314.32s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, 25 percent for allowing fentanyl and allowing [[09:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35317.96s)]
*  the borders to be weak. [[09:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35325.96s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars while I sit here and talk to you. [[09:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35327.96s)]
*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, other than the tariffs that I put [[09:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35333.96s)]
*  on previous to Biden, which were the tariffs I put on China, where we took in, up until [[09:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35337.96s)]
*  this point, probably $700 billion. [[09:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35342.96s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[09:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35346.6s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[09:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35347.6s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[09:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35349.6s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[09:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35350.6s)]
*  The family got paid money. [[09:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35352.6s)]
*  He did. [[09:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35354.6s)]
*  And so, I don't know, maybe that was the reason or maybe it wasn't. [[09:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35355.6s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't because there was so much money that his budgets, [[09:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35359.6s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[09:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35364.6s)]
*  But I took in, in the — up until this point, my tariffs on China. [[09:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35367.6s)]
*  I mean, no other president ever took in 10 cents from China. [[09:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35375.24s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[09:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35377.24s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[09:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35378.24s)]
*  So, we're doing very well. [[09:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35381.24s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[09:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35384.24s)]
*  They had a bad report today from one of the healthcare companies that had an impact on [[09:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35386.24s)]
*  the stock market. [[09:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35392.24s)]
*  But this is about the — this is really — we're building a base. [[09:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35393.24s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[09:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35397.24s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy in the history of our country by far — history [[09:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35399.24s)]
*  of any country, probably, but the history of our country in four years. [[09:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35404.88s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[09:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35408.88s)]
*  The Press. [[09:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35411.88s)]
*  Will that be signed here at the White House with Ukraine on Thursday? [[09:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35412.88s)]
*  Will President Volodymyr Zelensky be coming here for that? [[09:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35419.88s)]
*  The President. [[09:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35420.88s)]
*  I don't know exactly. [[09:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35421.88s)]
*  I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[09:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35422.88s)]
*  What do you think? [[09:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35423.88s)]
*  Where would it be signed and when? [[09:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35424.88s)]
*  The Press. [[09:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35425.88s)]
*  We're still working on the details. [[09:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35426.88s)]
*  We're shooting for around April 20th. [[09:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35427.88s)]
*  The Press. [[09:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35428.88s)]
*  Is there any more detail that you could tell us about what's in that deal and how it came [[09:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35429.88s)]
*  together? [[09:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35430.88s)]
*  The Press. [[09:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35431.88s)]
*  It's substantially what we agreed on previously with the — the President was here. [[09:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35433.52s)]
*  We had a memorandum of understanding. [[09:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35440.52s)]
*  We went straight to the big deal. [[09:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35443.52s)]
*  And the — I think it's an 80-take agreement. [[09:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35446.52s)]
*  And that's what will be signed. [[09:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35449.52s)]
*  The Press. [[09:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35450.52s)]
*  President Trump, on rate cuts, can you clarify — can you clarify on rate cuts? [[09:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35451.52s)]
*  Do you intend to see Powell's firing if he doesn't change his stance on rate cuts? [[09:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35454.52s)]
*  Or is that on the table? [[09:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35460.159999999996s)]
*  Or is that — [[09:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35463.159999999996s)]
*  The President. [[09:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35464.159999999996s)]
*  Well, I think he should do the rate cuts because I think if Europe has done it — I mean, [[09:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35465.159999999996s)]
*  puts us at a disadvantage to Europe. [[09:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35468.159999999996s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[09:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35470.159999999996s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[09:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35473.079999999994s)]
*  We don't have, really, inflation now. [[09:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35474.579999999994s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[09:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35476.579999999994s)]
*  Oil is great. [[09:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35479.88s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[09:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35481.799999999996s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[09:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35483.84s)]
*  And oil is down into the $60 — $65 range now per barrel. [[09:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35486.159999999996s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 for gasoline. [[09:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35492.32s)]
*  And food is down. [[09:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35497.399999999994s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[09:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35500.03999999999s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything is down. [[09:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35504.6s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[09:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35506.6s)]
*  They're not — it's not that they're up. [[09:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35507.6s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[09:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35509.88s)]
*  We should — if he would lower the interest rate, I think it would have a good impact [[09:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35511.32s)]
*  on that, too. [[09:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35515.3s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[09:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35516.3s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[09:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35518.3s)]
*  I would say we have essentially no inflation. [[09:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35519.46s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[09:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35521.5s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[09:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35523.94s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[09:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35525.46s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[09:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35528.46s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[09:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35529.9s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down — and they have gone down a lot. [[09:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35533.1s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[09:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35537.020000000004s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[09:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35539.14s)]
*  That means that people driving cars are going to be paying $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[09:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35541.78s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried — they tried just for the purpose of the [[09:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35549.02s)]
*  election to get it down. [[09:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35553.1s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[09:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35555.06s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[09:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35557.7s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 because of their policy. [[09:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35560.299999999996s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[09:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35567.619999999995s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[09:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35570.14000000001s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[09:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35572.100000000006s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation when oil has come down quite a bit. [[09:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35573.66s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people to get interest rates down. [[09:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35579.58s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[09:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35585.420000000006s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[09:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35587.700000000004s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[09:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35590.82000000001s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[09:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35593.740000000005s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[09:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35595.340000000004s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure for him to lower interest rates. [[09:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35598.840000000004s)]
*  Okay? [[09:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35602.36s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[09:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35603.36s)]
*  Please. [[09:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35608.36s)]
*  Do you think that Italy can be your best ally in Europe? [[09:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35609.36s)]
*  And also, there are notice when you walk into the finance. [[09:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35611.880000000005s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister can it be our best ally. [[09:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35615.200000000004s)]

*  illegal migration, on fighting against synthetic drugs. [[09:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35785.76s)]
*  Italy has been one of the nations that made a plan [[09:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35791.560000000005s)]

*  and things that we can do together about defense, [[09:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35803.58s)]
*  about economic, about economy, about space, about energy. [[09:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35807.48s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also nuclear [[09:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35815.68s)]

*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been [[09:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35828.44s)]
*  doing for many years. [[09:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35834.78s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around 10 [[09:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35836.520000000004s)]
*  billions. [[09:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35840.08s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[09:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35841.22s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[09:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35844.86s)]
*  It's not only about Italy, it's about the entire Europe. [[09:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35846.6s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[09:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35851.04s)]
*  Investments, trade, it's a topic that we are discussing [[09:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35856.1s)]
*  in this week. [[09:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35862.3s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody called me, [[09:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35863.92s)]
*  I was saying it before, such a Western nationalism. [[09:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35866.3s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that [[09:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35869.700000000004s)]
*  when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about [[09:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35873.28s)]
*  geographical space. [[09:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35876.06s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[09:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35877.54s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[09:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35880.020000000004s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the two [[09:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35882.24s)]
*  shores of the Atlantic, it is the time that we try to sit [[09:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35887.48s)]
*  down and find solutions. [[09:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35891.880000000005s)]
*  So I want to thank President Trump for having accepted [[09:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35893.56s)]
*  an invitation to pay an official visit to Rome in the [[09:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35897.840000000004s)]
*  near future and consider a possibility in that occasion [[09:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35901.04s)]
*  to meet also with Europe. [[09:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35904.66s)]
*  The goal for me is to make the West great again. [[09:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35907.86s)]
*  And I think we can do it together. [[09:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35911.34s)]
*  We can. [[09:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35913.06s)]
*  And we will keep on working on that. [[09:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35914.82s)]
*  I'm going to close. [[09:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35918.58s)]
*  I want to say only I'm proud of sitting here as Prime [[09:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35919.42s)]

*  has a very good situation despite the difficulties, [[09:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35928.1s)]
*  a stable country, a reliable country, one million more jobs [[09:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35930.78s)]
*  in the last two years and a half. [[09:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35935.62s)]
*  Great. [[09:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35937.5s)]
*  Inflation is going down. [[09:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35938.7s)]
*  So you forgive me if I promote a bit my country, [[09:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35940.1s)]
*  but you're a businessman and you understand me. [[09:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35944.08s)]
*  So migration flows going down 60%. [[09:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35946.88s)]
*  So we are trying to do our best, but I think we can do it [[09:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35950.28s)]
*  even better together. [[09:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35952.92s)]
*  Also in Ukraine, I will close. [[09:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35954.28s)]
*  Together we've been defending the freedom of Ukraine. [[09:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35956.24s)]
*  Together we can build a just and lasting peace. [[09:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35958.28s)]
*  We support your efforts, Donald. [[09:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35960.439999999995s)]

*  we want to get it done and we'll see if we can. [[09:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35967.18s)]
*  We want to save on average, think of it every week, [[09:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35970.1s)]
*  2,500 people are being killed, mostly soldiers, [[09:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35973.26s)]
*  Russian, Ukrainian soldiers. [[09:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35976.58s)]
*  And if we can save those lives, that'd be a very good thing. [[09:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35978.94s)]
*  And so we'll see what we can do. [[09:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=35982.1s)]

*  Yeah, question. [[10:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36053.719999999994s)]
*  Well, you're going to have to speak to the lawyers. [[10:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36065.92s)]
*  We have great lawyers. [[10:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36067.399999999994s)]
*  I can tell you this, we're doing a fantastic job [[10:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36069.52s)]
*  of getting criminals out of this country [[10:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36072.119999999995s)]
*  who Biden allowed into the country. [[10:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36073.92s)]
*  Hundreds of thousands of criminals, [[10:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36076.6s)]
*  murderers and drug dealers. [[10:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36078.939999999995s)]
*  And I was elected because of the fact, [[10:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36081.86s)]
*  I would say maybe that was the number one fact [[10:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36085.14s)]
*  for a lot of reasons, the economy, a lot of things. [[10:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36087.06s)]
*  But one of the primary reasons I was elected [[10:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36089.159999999996s)]
*  is because I said, I'm gonna get the criminals [[10:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36091.899999999994s)]
*  that he allowed to come into our country [[10:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36094.46s)]
*  so stupidly through open borders, [[10:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36096.1s)]
*  I'm gonna get them out. [[10:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36099.06s)]
*  And I got a lot of votes, [[10:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36100.7s)]
*  record-setting numbers of votes, as you know. [[10:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36103.34s)]
*  We won everything. [[10:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36105.5s)]
*  The popular vote, all seven swing states, [[10:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36106.35999999999s)]
*  we won everything. [[10:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36109.24s)]
*  And that's what the public wanted [[10:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36110.079999999994s)]
*  and that's what I'm doing. [[10:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36112.64s)]
*  But you'll have to speak to the lawyers [[10:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36114.03999999999s)]
*  because it's up to them. [[10:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36115.479999999996s)]
*  Say it. [[10:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36117.119999999995s)]
*  What do you think of the proposal from France and UK [[10:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36119.96s)]
*  of a peace mission in Ukraine with soldiers? [[10:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36122.119999999995s)]
*  And do you think that Italy should take part in it? [[10:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36126.03999999999s)]
*  Well, I think Italy will have to make that determination. [[10:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36129.52s)]
*  But peace missions are always good with me. [[10:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36131.92s)]
*  I'm okay with peace missions. [[10:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36134.479999999996s)]
*  Yeah, please. [[10:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36136.060000000005s)]
*  Mr. President, have you discussed, [[10:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36136.9s)]
*  what areas of cooperation have you discussed [[10:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36138.380000000005s)]
*  with the Prime Minister, [[10:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36140.700000000004s)]
*  is it Italy and the United States, [[10:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36142.16s)]
*  and Europe and the United States? [[10:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36143.700000000004s)]
*  And China? [[10:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36145.46s)]
*  We discussed it very briefly. [[10:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36146.46s)]
*  We're doing very well with negotiations, [[10:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36148.1s)]
*  I think, with all countries. [[10:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36150.5s)]
*  And Scott could tell you a little bit, [[10:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36152.46s)]
*  but we are doing very well. [[10:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36155.82s)]
*  We have a lot of countries that wanna make a deal. [[10:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36157.08s)]
*  Frankly, they wanna make deals more than I do. [[10:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36160.22s)]
*  Go ahead, Scott, would you say something? [[10:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36162.46s)]
*  We've been a process in place. [[10:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36164.439999999995s)]
*  We're working on the big 15 economies. [[10:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36165.92s)]
*  We had a fantastic meeting with Japan yesterday. [[10:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36169.799999999996s)]
*  I believe they've been called with the EU already. [[10:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36173.6s)]
*  And then we have South Korea coming in next week. [[10:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36176.799999999996s)]
*  And I believe India is also talking, [[10:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36179.72s)]
*  that's moving very quickly. [[10:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36184.28s)]
*  Mr. President, [[10:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36186.84s)]
*  Mr. President, [[10:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36187.92s)]
*  Go ahead. [[10:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36188.759999999995s)]
*  Ukraine's President Zelensky [[10:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36189.6s)]
*  has said he's gonna invest in China, [[10:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36191.24s)]
*  supply weaponry or ammunition to Russia. [[10:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36193.66s)]
*  Do you have any evidence on those? [[10:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36196.86s)]
*  Also, he said we could see a minerals deal signed this week. [[10:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36198.740000000005s)]
*  Well, we have a minerals deal, [[10:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36202.18s)]
*  which I guess is gonna be signed on Thursday, Scott, [[10:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36203.5s)]
*  next Thursday, soon. [[10:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36206.060000000005s)]
*  And I assume they're gonna live up to the deal, [[10:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36208.82s)]
*  so we'll see. [[10:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36211.18s)]
*  But we have a deal on that. [[10:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36212.020000000004s)]
*  No, I have no comment on that. [[10:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36215.58s)]
*  I have no idea. [[10:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36217.04s)]
*  That's his statement, not mine. [[10:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36218.020000000004s)]
*  Mr. President, [[10:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36220.18s)]
*  did you wave off the Israeli attack [[10:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36221.92s)]
*  on Iranian nuclear facilities? [[10:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36224.119999999995s)]
*  Did you comment on that? [[10:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36226.119999999995s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[10:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36226.96s)]
*  And they say the attack is what? [[10:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36228.84s)]
*  That you waved off an Israeli plan [[10:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36230.479999999996s)]
*  to attack Iranian nuclear facilities. [[10:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36232.759999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[10:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36235.56s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it, [[10:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36236.68s)]
*  because I think that Iran has a chance [[10:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36238.52s)]
*  to have a great country, [[10:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36240.88s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[10:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36242.6s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[10:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36246.34s)]
*  That's my first option. [[10:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36247.35999999999s)]
*  If there's a second option, [[10:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36249.520000000004s)]
*  I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[10:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36252.68s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[10:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36255.4s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[10:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36259.68s)]
*  It's gonna be very good for them if they do. [[10:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36260.920000000006s)]
*  And I'd like to see Iran thrive in the future, [[10:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36262.840000000004s)]
*  do fantastically well. [[10:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36266.16s)]
*  I know the Iranian people, they're incredible people. [[10:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36268.76s)]
*  Always have been very smart, very energetic, [[10:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36271.740000000005s)]
*  very successful people. [[10:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36274.240000000005s)]
*  And I don't want to do anything [[10:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36276.36s)]
*  that's gonna hurt anybody. [[10:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36279.06s)]
*  I really don't. [[10:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36280.42s)]
*  But Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[10:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36281.26s)]
*  It's pretty simple. [[10:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36283.9s)]
*  It's really simple. [[10:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36285.58s)]
*  We're not looking to take their industry. [[10:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36287.26s)]
*  We're not looking to take their land. [[10:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36290.06s)]
*  All we're saying is you can't have a nuclear weapon. [[10:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36292.58s)]
*  The deal that was made, [[10:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36296.26s)]
*  the deal that was made with Obama, [[10:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36297.340000000004s)]
*  that deal would have expired already. [[10:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36300.46s)]
*  It was a terrible deal. [[10:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36302.06s)]
*  It would have expired. [[10:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36303.7s)]
*  That gave them a clear path to a nuclear weapon. [[10:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36306.46s)]
*  I wouldn't have accepted. [[10:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36309.02s)]
*  That's why I terminated the deal. [[10:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36310.06s)]
*  Number one, it was way too short. [[10:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36311.5s)]
*  When countries are involved, you don't make short-term deals. [[10:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36313.7s)]
*  These are countries with long lives. [[10:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36317.5s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[10:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36320.02s)]
*  And it was a great termination [[10:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36322.9s)]
*  because it didn't allow us to do anything. [[10:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36324.34s)]
*  Once it terminated, you know what the deal was. [[10:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36326.38s)]
*  It was a terrible deal, really. [[10:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36328.34s)]
*  One of many terrible deals made by the US. [[10:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36330.74s)]
*  But, no, I'd like to see Iran thrive. [[10:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36334.26s)]
*  And they can do that, I think, very easily, [[10:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36338.86s)]
*  or they can do it the other way. [[10:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36341.5s)]
*  The other way is not going to be good for them. [[10:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36343.86s)]
*  It's going to be really bad for them. [[10:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36345.82s)]
*  The Press. [[10:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36347.62s)]
*  The Press. [[10:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36349.06s)]
*  When did you make up an idea, [[10:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36350.659999999996s)]
*  a CEO going to China and met with a trade official there? [[10:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36351.76s)]
*  Well, Jensen is an amazing guy. [[10:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36355.3s)]
*  He's become a friend of mine. [[10:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36357.06s)]
*  And, I don't know, he's a person [[10:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36358.38s)]
*  that's very proud of our country. [[10:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36361.78s)]
*  He loves our country. [[10:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36363.03999999999s)]
*  I'm not worried about Jensen at all. [[10:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36363.939999999995s)]
*  Mr. President, if you're holding [[10:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36366.119999999995s)]
*  the President of the United States [[10:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36367.68s)]
*  in front of a judge. [[10:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36370.219999999994s)]
*  Well, I'm not involved in it. [[10:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36371.78s)]
*  I'm going to respond by saying [[10:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36373.159999999996s)]
*  you'll have to speak to the lawyers, the DOJ. [[10:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36375.259999999995s)]
*  I've heard many things about him. [[10:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36379.0s)]
*  And we'll have to find out what the truth is. [[10:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36381.259999999995s)]
*  But I will say this, you know, we were inundated [[10:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36386.159999999996s)]
*  by millions of people, many millions of people [[10:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36391.0s)]
*  during the Biden administration. [[10:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36393.340000000004s)]
*  They say 21 million. [[10:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36394.840000000004s)]
*  And a big percentage of those are criminals, [[10:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36397.200000000004s)]
*  serious criminals. [[10:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36400.58s)]
*  I'm not saying just criminals [[10:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36401.64000000001s)]
*  because they came into the border illegally. [[10:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36402.840000000004s)]
*  I'm saying they're criminals [[10:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36405.520000000004s)]
*  at the highest level, murderers. [[10:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36407.420000000006s)]
*  Many of those people murdered more than one person [[10:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36409.560000000005s)]
*  and they're on the loose. [[10:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36412.48s)]
*  And I was elected to get rid of those criminals, [[10:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36414.66s)]
*  to get them out of our country, or to put them away, [[10:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36417.060000000005s)]
*  but to get them out of our country. [[10:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36420.02s)]
*  And I don't see how judges can take that authority [[10:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36422.48s)]
*  away from a president. [[10:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36425.52s)]
*  We've done an amazing job. [[10:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36426.8s)]
*  Tom Oldman, Kristi Noem, we have done an amazing job. [[10:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36428.06s)]
*  Nobody can believe the job we've done. [[10:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36432.5s)]
*  Far greater than what I said. [[10:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36434.8s)]
*  I mean, I got elected on that, [[10:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36436.2s)]
*  but we've done much better. [[10:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36437.44s)]
*  We have, right now, 99 percent border. [[10:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36438.44s)]
*  It's a 99 percent. [[10:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36441.18s)]
*  Nobody thought that would even be, [[10:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36442.74s)]
*  nobody's coming through our border, practically. [[10:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36444.14s)]
*  Two weeks ago, we had nine people come through, [[10:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36447.78s)]
*  all for medical reasons. [[10:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36449.76s)]
*  We allowed them, we brought them through, [[10:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36450.96s)]
*  because one had a heart attack, one had something else. [[10:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36452.44s)]
*  And all for medical reasons. [[10:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36455.74s)]
*  We have a great border. [[10:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36458.94s)]
*  We had a great border four years ago, [[10:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36459.78s)]
*  but we have a border now that's even tighter. [[10:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36462.38s)]
*  And we did that in a matter of weeks. [[10:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36464.840000000004s)]
*  And, no, we have to, we need, [[10:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36467.62s)]
*  we need to get murderers and drug dealers [[10:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36471.88s)]
*  and people that were in jail for horrible. [[10:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36474.06s)]
*  You know, they released jails, Georgia, [[10:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36477.14s)]
*  from all over the world and released them, [[10:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36480.600000000006s)]
*  not just South America, all over the world. [[10:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36483.240000000005s)]
*  The Congo and Africa. [[10:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36485.08s)]
*  Many, many people come from the Congo. [[10:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36487.18s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but they came from the Congo. [[10:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36488.840000000004s)]
*  And all over the world, they came in, [[10:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36492.46s)]
*  opened their jails, Venezuela. [[10:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36494.62s)]
*  Practically all of their prisoners [[10:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36497.18s)]
*  released into our country. [[10:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36498.62s)]
*  And we took them because we had an incompetent administration [[10:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36499.76s)]
*  called the Biden administration. [[10:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36503.86s)]
*  And to think what they've done to our country. [[10:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36506.44s)]
*  And I was elected to straighten that out. [[10:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36509.84s)]
*  And I'm doing that. [[10:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36512.479999999996s)]
*  But we have activist judges that don't want murderers [[10:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36514.479999999996s)]
*  to be sent out of our country. [[10:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36517.94s)]
*  They don't want killers and drug dealers and drug lords [[10:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36519.68s)]
*  and people from mental institutions. [[10:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36522.92s)]
*  They want them to stay in our country, I guess. [[10:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36525.42s)]
*  I don't know, maybe that's the liberal way, [[10:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36527.52s)]
*  or as they call it nowadays, the progressive way. [[10:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36530.159999999996s)]
*  But I don't think it's the way that our country believes. [[10:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36532.54s)]
*  And that's why I wanted a landslide. [[10:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36536.04s)]
*  The Press. [[10:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36537.64s)]
*  The Press. [[10:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36539.04s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident [[10:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36540.04s)]
*  these deals will be done. [[10:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36544.42s)]
*  But you also said that you're in no rush. [[10:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36545.42s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[10:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36547.020000000004s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[10:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36548.76s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[10:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36550.16s)]
*  The President. So they've already seen it get much better. [[10:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36553.86s)]
*  Because if you were truthful, which you're not, [[10:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36557.700000000004s)]
*  you know, I know you very well. [[10:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36559.96s)]
*  You have gasoline that hit a dollar and 98 [[10:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36562.64s)]
*  yesterday in a couple of states. [[10:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36566.4s)]
*  You have gasoline is way down. [[10:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36568.54s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[10:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36569.94s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[10:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36573.94s)]
*  The price of eggs. [[10:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36577.14s)]
*  You know, when I came in, they hit me with eggs. [[10:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36579.62s)]
*  I just got there. I was here for one week, [[10:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36582.68s)]
*  and they started screaming, [[10:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36584.560000000005s)]
*  eggs have gone through the roof. [[10:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36585.72s)]
*  I said, I just got here. I was there for seven days. [[10:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36587.4s)]
*  And I hear that eggs have gone through the roof [[10:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36590.42s)]
*  before I got there. [[10:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36592.979999999996s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press, [[10:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36594.52s)]
*  the fake news like you, you're fake. [[10:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36596.42s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me like about eggs. [[10:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36598.619999999995s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. I just this is my seventh day. [[10:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36602.299999999996s)]
*  And they were right. They went up 87 percent. [[10:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36606.259999999995s)]
*  And you couldn't get them. They said, [[10:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36608.6s)]
*  you won't have eggs for Easter, which is coming up. [[10:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36609.799999999996s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[10:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36612.4s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[10:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36614.14s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[10:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36616.34s)]
*  And now eggs have all over the place. [[10:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36617.78s)]
*  And the price went down 92 percent. [[10:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36619.82s)]
*  And our commissioner of agriculture, [[10:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36622.92s)]
*  Brooke, has done a fantastic job. [[10:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36625.42s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[10:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36629.06s)]
*  So prices haven't gone up. [[10:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36630.8s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest rates, [[10:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36632.12s)]
*  because we have a federal reserve chairman [[10:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36635.42s)]
*  that is playing politics. [[10:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36637.5s)]
*  Somebody that I've never been very fond of, actually. [[10:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36640.54s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[10:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36643.64s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[10:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36646.2s)]
*  They should be coming down in Europe. [[10:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36647.78s)]
*  As you know, they reduced them, I guess, seven times. [[10:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36650.38s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again [[10:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36653.88s)]
*  and again and again. [[10:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36655.44s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[10:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36657.04s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[10:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36659.44s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, [[10:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36663.619999999995s)]
*  but that's the only thing. [[10:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36665.159999999996s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, [[10:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36666.08s)]
*  because they're not very smart people. [[10:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36668.82s)]
*  The Press. [[10:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36670.82s)]
*  Go ahead. Yes, sir. Please. [[10:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36674.0s)]

*  The Press. [[10:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36677.020000000004s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, [[10:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36681.18s)]
*  we had the greatest economy in the history of our country. [[10:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36683.420000000006s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[10:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36685.82s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain [[10:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36688.8s)]
*  because we had the most successful administration [[10:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36691.66s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[10:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36693.94s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time [[10:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36697.060000000005s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers [[10:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36698.98s)]
*  that we're taking in are astronomical. [[10:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36702.0s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money [[10:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36703.94s)]
*  with the tariffs. [[10:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36706.0s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[10:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36707.340000000004s)]
*  And countries are having a hard time getting used to the fact [[10:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36710.04s)]
*  that they can't do that to us anymore [[10:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36714.04s)]
*  because we have a real President. [[10:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36715.54s)]
*  We have a President that understands what it's all about. [[10:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36717.54s)]
*  We had Presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[10:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36721.380000000005s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, [[10:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36725.66s)]
*  or they didn't like business, or it wasn't like a priority. [[10:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36727.420000000006s)]
*  And then you had, like, the last administration, [[10:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36731.26s)]
*  the only thing they were good at was cheating in elections. [[10:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36733.200000000004s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[10:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36735.619999999995s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[10:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36736.68s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[10:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36738.18s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[10:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36739.22s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[10:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36742.56s)]
*  You know why? [[10:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36745.9s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst President. Joe Biden was. [[10:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36747.4s)]
*  So I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers. [[10:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36751.76s)]
*  When this all happens, it's happening now. [[10:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36755.64s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[10:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36757.74s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, [[10:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36759.54s)]
*  we'll make the deal for them [[10:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36761.1s)]
*  because that's what's going to happen. [[10:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36762.78s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[10:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36764.16s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[10:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36766.44s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott [[10:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36768.04s)]
*  and the other people that are working on it [[10:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36774.54s)]
*  that we're listening [[10:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36776.920000000006s)]
*  and we're going to be very fair to people. [[10:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36778.62s)]
*  But you know, we're the one that really sets the deal, [[10:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36781.420000000006s)]
*  and that's what we'll be doing. [[10:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36784.08s)]
*  Okay? [[10:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36785.68s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Please. [[10:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36787.32s)]
*  The Press. A question. [[10:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36790.520000000004s)]
*  Today, our Prime Minister — [[10:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36791.46s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[10:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36793.44s)]
*  You're so lucky. Yes. [[10:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36794.96s)]
*  The Press. Oh, yes. Yes. [[10:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36796.560000000005s)]
*  Okay. I'm not sure that it would be — [[10:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36798.28s)]
*  I — that sounded absolutely — that was so beautiful. [[10:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36853.68s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[10:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36881.92s)]
*  What did she say? Please. [[10:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36883.799999999996s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[10:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36885.399999999994s)]
*  It was about — [[10:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36887.56s)]
*  It was beautifully presented. [[10:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36888.64s)]
*  But maybe I could hear what she said. [[10:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36890.719999999994s)]
*  Please, Scott. [[10:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36893.64s)]
*  The Press. Go ahead. [[10:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36894.84s)]
*  The Press. Guys, have some respect, please. [[10:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36896.35999999999s)]
*  Thank you. No, no, wait. [[10:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36901.28s)]
*  The Press. I want to hear what she said. [[10:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36902.88s)]
*  The Press. Go ahead, please. [[10:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36904.88s)]
*  The Press. Yeah, the President — [[10:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36907.03999999999s)]
*  Prime Minister Maroni was asked whether — [[10:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36909.24s)]
*  what she thinks about the fact that President Trump [[10:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36911.6s)]
*  holds Zelenskyy responsible for the war in Ukraine. [[10:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36914.52s)]
*  And Prime Minister Maroni answered, [[10:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36920.04s)]
*  well, actually, we have — [[10:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36922.479999999996s)]
*  no, and also, if you talked about the military spending, [[10:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36929.24s)]
*  how — and the raising of the military spending. [[10:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36934.079999999994s)]
*  And the fact — and the first thing [[10:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36936.72s)]
*  Prime Minister Maroni said is that, no, actually, [[10:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36939.88s)]
*  we didn't talk about the raise of military spending. [[10:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36942.56s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[10:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36945.28s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware [[10:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36949.64s)]
*  of the fact that it is very important to — [[10:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36952.159999999996s)]
*  The Press. Well, I will do that. [[10:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36956.2s)]
*  The Press. Defense is very important. [[10:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36957.2s)]
*  The Press. I will do that. [[10:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36958.03999999999s)]
*  They've been asking if we raise — [[10:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36958.799999999996s)]
*  if we decided on a defense percentage [[10:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36960.56s)]
*  about the defense spending. [[10:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36963.2s)]
*  The Press. Right. [[10:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36965.84s)]
*  The Press. NATO? [[10:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36966.84s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent, [[10:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36968.280000000006s)]
*  as it was already decided. [[10:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36971.32s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[10:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36973.840000000004s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important [[10:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36977.840000000004s)]
*  for the future, and we see what — [[10:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36982.0s)]
*  also, the war that we are trying to do at the European level. [[10:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36983.600000000006s)]
*  The President. And I don't hold — [[10:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36988.16s)]
*  I don't hold Zelenskyy responsible. [[10:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36989.44s)]
*  But I'm not exactly thrilled with the fact [[10:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36992.16s)]
*  that that war started. [[10:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36996.24s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started [[10:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=36997.32s)]
*  if I were President. [[10:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37000.04s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[10:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37001.079999999994s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, [[10:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37004.36s)]
*  and they'd have — they have beautiful terraces. [[10:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37006.6s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, [[10:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37008.4s)]
*  but they're not with us any longer. [[10:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37011.32s)]
*  They have smashed to smithereens, [[10:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37012.759999999995s)]
*  laying on the ground in a million pieces, [[10:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37015.479999999996s)]
*  getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[10:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37018.159999999996s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, [[10:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37021.479999999996s)]
*  and I'm not happy with anybody involved. [[10:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37024.84s)]
*  I think it's a war — I know it's a war. [[10:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37026.96s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[10:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37029.159999999996s)]
*  It was never close to happening. It was never even a thought. [[10:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37030.6s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[10:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37033.96s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye, [[10:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37036.2s)]
*  but there's no way he would have ever gone in [[10:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37037.32s)]
*  if I were President. [[10:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37039.6s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, [[10:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37040.68s)]
*  because, as you know, Russia is a lot bigger. [[10:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37043.4s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[10:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37048.04s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved [[10:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37050.64s)]
*  and get involved in wars that — [[10:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37054.28s)]
*  you can blame the man that was sitting in this seat, Biden. [[10:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37057.52s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[10:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37060.56s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — [[10:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37062.36s)]
*  if I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[10:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37065.64s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[10:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37068.2s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say [[10:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37070.08s)]
*  he's done the greatest job. Okay? [[10:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37072.92s)]
*  I'm not a big fan. I really am. I'm not a big fan. [[10:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37075.56s)]
*  The Press. [[10:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37079.68s)]
*  Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. [[10:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37083.840000000004s)]
*  Are you sure about the definition of a parasite, [[10:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37095.28s)]
*  of a European? [[10:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37098.36s)]
*  Would you say that again, that European parasites — [[10:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37099.32s)]
*  He's never said it. [[10:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37102.16s)]
*  Would you say again that — [[10:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37103.16s)]
*  The Europeans — [[10:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37104.16s)]
*  Have you ever said that Europeans are parasites? [[10:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37105.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[10:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37107.28s)]
*  Have you seen it? [[10:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37108.04s)]
*  No. I haven't said — I don't know what — [[10:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37108.76s)]
*  I don't even know what you're talking about. [[10:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37110.8s)]
*  Go ahead, please. Go ahead. [[10:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37112.520000000004s)]
*  No, no, wait, wait. Next. Next. Next. Go. [[10:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37117.76s)]
*  The Press. Thank you. [[10:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37120.76s)]
*  Foreign Minister Milley just said [[10:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37122.0s)]
*  you want to make Europe great again, [[10:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37124.0s)]
*  and we want to do it together, together in the West. [[10:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37126.64s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. [[10:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37128.48s)]
*  Did you — I guess that's what you said, Mr. Prime Minister. [[10:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37129.72s)]
*  How are you going to do that? [[10:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37133.48s)]
*  And are you looking to do it — to counter China, [[10:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37135.32s)]
*  who is really trying to gather influence [[10:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37138.84s)]
*  against the United States? [[10:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37142.64s)]
*  What are the health of those children? [[10:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37144.2s)]
*  I hope that Europe is going to be great again. [[10:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37146.119999999995s)]
*  Europe has gone through a lot of problems, [[10:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37148.36s)]
*  and a lot of it is having to do with immigration. [[10:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37150.119999999995s)]
*  And I'm not a big fan of Europe [[10:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37153.2s)]
*  and what they've done with immigration at all. [[10:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37155.24s)]
*  And I think they've got to get smart, [[10:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37158.119999999995s)]
*  because Europe is being very badly hurt [[10:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37160.6s)]
*  by what they've done with immigration. [[10:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37163.2s)]
*  I'll say this, that the Prime Minister [[10:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37165.04s)]
*  has taken a very tough stand on immigration. [[10:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37167.24s)]
*  And I commented to her before. [[10:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37171.52s)]
*  I said, I wish more people would be like you, [[10:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37173.56s)]
*  having to do with that subject. [[10:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37175.48s)]
*  But they're not. Europe is very important to me. [[10:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37176.92s)]
*  Europe is very important to the world. [[10:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37181.4s)]
*  I want Europe to do very well. [[10:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37183.24s)]
*  I think they have to get a lot smarter on immigration. [[10:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37185.08s)]
*  But we are beginning to do it — doing it. [[10:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37188.52s)]
*  You've seen — you've all seen how the policies [[10:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37190.8s)]
*  of the European Union in the last, [[10:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37193.56s)]
*  let's say, two and a half years have been changing. [[10:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37195.72s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about [[10:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37198.04s)]
*  how we were redistributing illegal migrants [[10:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37201.24s)]
*  coming to Italy. [[10:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37204.0s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[10:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37204.96s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, [[10:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37209.439999999995s)]
*  and to return people. [[10:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37212.759999999995s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules [[10:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37215.04s)]
*  about repatriations and things like that. [[10:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37217.88s)]
*  So things are changing. [[10:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37220.88s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought [[10:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37222.84s)]
*  in lowering the rates of illegal migration. [[10:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37225.88s)]
*  So they — we are working now together. [[10:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37230.079999999994s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[10:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37233.439999999995s)]
*  The President's voice is very clear. [[10:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37235.079999999994s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37238.64s)]
*  Go ahead. [[10:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37240.119999999995s)]
*  I'd like to ask — [[10:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37241.52s)]
*  President Romani, if you have discussed an option [[10:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37243.24s)]
*  of starting European-European relations with black communications, [[10:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37245.84s)]
*  and President Trump, [[10:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37249.2s)]
*  if you want to see the Google company — [[10:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37251.24s)]
*  The Google what? [[10:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37255.03999999999s)]
*  The Google company. [[10:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37256.03999999999s)]
*  What about — [[10:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37257.439999999995s)]
*  The Google business. [[10:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37258.439999999995s)]
*  I want to see it now. [[10:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37259.439999999995s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37261.03999999999s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[10:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37262.079999999994s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[10:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37266.119999999995s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[10:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37269.32s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, [[10:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37274.159999999996s)]
*  but we didn't discuss it. [[10:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37277.119999999995s)]
*  I'm just asking about the tariffs. [[10:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37278.96000000001s)]
*  Are you thinking of other things, [[10:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37281.12s)]
*  like the prime minister, that changed your mind potentially [[10:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37284.0s)]
*  about tariffs and what you're planning to do going forward? [[10:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37286.32s)]
*  No. [[10:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37288.76s)]
*  The training of prime ministers, that changed your — [[10:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37289.76s)]
*  No, tariffs are making us rich. [[10:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37291.32s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden — [[10:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37293.32s)]
*  trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[10:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37297.72s)]
*  And now that's — that whole tide has turned. [[10:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37301.48s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[10:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37304.4s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[10:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37306.16s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, [[10:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37307.2s)]
*  25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, [[10:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37310.38s)]
*  10 percent baseline. [[10:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37313.68s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[10:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37316.24s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[10:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37319.52s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl [[10:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37322.619999999995s)]
*  and allowing the borders to be weak. [[10:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37327.02s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars [[10:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37330.299999999996s)]
*  while I sit here and talk to you. [[10:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37332.659999999996s)]
*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, [[10:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37336.0s)]
*  other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[10:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37338.7s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China, [[10:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37341.9s)]
*  where we took in, up until this point, [[10:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37343.54s)]
*  probably $700 billion. [[10:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37345.799999999996s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[10:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37348.64s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[10:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37349.9s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[10:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37351.92s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[10:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37353.08s)]
*  Family got paid money. He did. [[10:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37355.44s)]
*  And so, I don't know, maybe that was the reason, [[10:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37357.72s)]
*  or maybe it wasn't. [[10:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37360.62s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't, [[10:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37361.58s)]
*  because there was so much money that his budgets — [[10:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37363.72s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[10:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37366.76s)]
*  But I took in, in the — up till this point, [[10:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37369.92s)]
*  my tariffs on China. [[10:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37374.8s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[10:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37376.3s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[10:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37378.5s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[10:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37380.14s)]
*  So, we're doing very well. [[10:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37383.64s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[10:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37386.78s)]
*  They had a bad report today [[10:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37388.880000000005s)]
*  from one of the healthcare companies [[10:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37391.14s)]
*  that had an impact on the stock market. [[10:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37394.08s)]
*  But this is about that. [[10:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37395.9s)]
*  This is really — we're building a base. [[10:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37397.62s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[10:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37399.479999999996s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy [[10:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37401.92s)]
*  in the history of our country by far — [[10:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37404.12s)]
*  history of any country, probably, [[10:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37406.26s)]
*  but the history of our country in four years. [[10:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37407.78s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[10:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37410.76s)]
*  The Press. [[10:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37413.12s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[10:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37423.32s)]
*  What do you think? Where would it be signed and when? [[10:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37425.520000000004s)]

*  We went straight to the big deal, [[10:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37445.36s)]
*  and I think it's an electric pavement, [[10:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37447.5s)]

*  advantage to Europe. [[10:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37470.96s)]
*  I mean, he plays right into their hands. [[10:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37471.96s)]
*  So I think he should do the rate cuts. [[10:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37474.9s)]
*  We don't have, really, inflation now. [[10:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37476.5s)]
*  I just said the major things are going down. [[10:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37478.6s)]
*  Oil is great. [[10:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37481.64s)]
*  Oil is way ahead of schedule. [[10:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37483.64s)]
*  And that's because of our policies. [[10:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37485.74s)]
*  But oil is down into the $60 or $65 range now per barrel. [[10:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37487.74s)]
*  And I told you, in certain states, we have less than $2 [[10:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37494.18s)]
*  for gasoline. [[10:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37497.62s)]
*  And food is down. [[10:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37499.08s)]
*  Groceries, as we call it, are down. [[10:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37502.14s)]
*  Other than interest rates, everything's down. [[10:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37506.42s)]
*  Interest rates are pretty flat. [[10:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37508.22s)]
*  It's not that they're up. [[10:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37510.380000000005s)]
*  But we should be better than flat. [[10:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37511.78s)]
*  If he would lower the interest rate, I think [[10:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37513.92s)]
*  would have a good impact on that, too. [[10:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37515.8s)]
*  But the costs are down. [[10:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37518.060000000005s)]
*  We have very little inflation. [[10:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37520.200000000004s)]
*  I would say we have, essentially, no inflation. [[10:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37521.46s)]
*  Hard to have inflation when oil goes down. [[10:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37523.340000000004s)]
*  And oil goes down. [[10:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37525.840000000004s)]
*  When Biden came in, oil went through the roof. [[10:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37527.32s)]
*  That's what caused our problem. [[10:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37530.32s)]
*  That and his very dumb spending. [[10:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37531.700000000004s)]
*  But when the oil prices go down — and they have gone down a lot. [[10:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37534.96000000001s)]
*  We've gotten it down really good. [[10:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37538.9s)]
*  We've opened it up and we've gotten them down. [[10:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37541.0s)]
*  And that means that people driving cars are going to be [[10:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37543.58s)]
*  paying $2 and $2.50 instead of $4.50. [[10:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37546.18s)]
*  And, you know, even at the end, they tried just for the purpose [[10:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37550.98s)]
*  of the election to get it down. [[10:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37554.920000000006s)]
*  But they had really lost that sucker. [[10:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37556.96s)]
*  That was really — it was not good. [[10:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37559.64s)]
*  But if they had won, oil right now would be at $7 or $8 [[10:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37562.14s)]
*  because of their policy. [[10:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37567.74s)]
*  And we're going to be at about $2. [[10:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37569.52s)]
*  Could be even a little bit less than that. [[10:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37572.219999999994s)]
*  And you're starting to see it. [[10:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37574.02s)]
*  So I don't know how you can have inflation [[10:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37575.56s)]
*  when oil has come down quite a bit. [[10:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37577.479999999996s)]
*  And I would say the Fed really owes it to the American people [[10:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37579.92s)]
*  to get interest rates down. [[10:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37586.24s)]
*  That's the only thing he's good for. [[10:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37587.4s)]
*  And he would have an effect on that if he lowered them. [[10:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37589.54s)]
*  And I think at some point he will. [[10:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37592.68s)]
*  He's going to have a lot of political pressure. [[10:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37595.72s)]
*  You know, they are political also. [[10:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37597.28s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of political pressure [[10:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37600.72s)]
*  for him to lower interest rates. [[10:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37602.520000000004s)]
*  Okay? [[10:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37604.020000000004s)]
*  The Press. [[10:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37605.020000000004s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[10:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37609.0s)]
*  Please. [[10:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37610.200000000004s)]
*  The Press. [[10:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37611.200000000004s)]
*  Only if the Prime Minister remains the Prime Minister [[10:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37616.8s)]
*  can it be our ambassador. [[10:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37620.44s)]
*  She's doing — no, she's doing a great job. [[10:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37622.08s)]
*  And yeah, certainly one of our great allies, [[10:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37624.880000000005s)]
*  not just in Europe, anywhere. [[10:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37628.18s)]
*  She's a fantastic person and doing a great job. [[10:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37630.42s)]
*  And our relationship is great. [[10:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37634.18s)]
*  And we have a lot of Italians in this country, I tell you. [[10:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37636.92s)]
*  And they like Trump and they voted for Trump. [[10:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37640.16s)]
*  So anyway. [[10:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37642.3s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[10:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37644.200000000004s)]

*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[10:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37675.8s)]
*  And I've been briefed on the Florida State University, [[10:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37679.100000000006s)]
*  Tallahassee, active shooting. [[10:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37682.44s)]
*  I guess it's an active shooter. [[10:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37685.740000000005s)]
*  Fully briefed as to where we are right now, it's a shame. [[10:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37689.340000000004s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[10:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37692.64s)]
*  Horrible that things like this take place. [[10:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37694.32s)]
*  And we'll have more to say about it later. [[10:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37697.880000000005s)]
*  In the meantime, it's an honor to have the Prime [[10:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37701.08s)]
*  Minister of Italy with us, Prime Minister Maloney, [[10:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37703.42s)]
*  who's doing a fantastic job. [[10:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37707.28s)]
*  I would say that she has taken Europe by storm and [[10:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37709.92s)]
*  highly respected. [[10:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37714.08s)]

*  And I can't say that about many people. [[10:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37717.92s)]
*  And she's become a friend. [[10:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37720.659999999996s)]
*  And we really have a great relationship between Italy [[10:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37723.06s)]
*  and ourselves. [[10:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37727.64s)]
*  And we talked about trade. [[10:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37728.64s)]
*  We talked about many, many things during our luncheon. [[10:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37730.46s)]

*  special person. [[10:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37738.240000000005s)]

*  strengthen our relationship, our friendship [[10:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37749.520000000004s)]
*  that comes from Grifo. [[10:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37752.18s)]
*  You know today is April 17th, and April 17th marks [[10:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37753.78s)]
*  the anniversary of the agreement that allowed [[10:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37758.479999999996s)]
*  Cristoforo Colombo to make his trip. [[10:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37762.18s)]
*  And I say to remember how ancient our ties, but also [[10:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37765.159999999996s)]
*  to remind that we both share another fight, which is [[10:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37770.159999999996s)]
*  the fight against the war and ADI ideology that would [[10:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37774.4s)]
*  like to erase our history. [[10:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37780.04s)]
*  And as I know that we share lots of things on [[10:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37782.5s)]
*  tackling illegal migration, on fighting against [[10:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37787.1s)]
*  synthetic drugs. [[10:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37792.04s)]
*  You know, Italy has been one of the nations that made a [[10:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37793.04s)]
*  plan against fentanyl, for example. [[10:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37796.18s)]
*  But we have been talking about many bilateral [[10:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37799.48s)]
*  topics and things that we can do together about [[10:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37804.48s)]
*  defense, about economic, about economy, about space, [[10:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37808.82s)]
*  about energy. [[10:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37814.54s)]
*  Italy will have to increase its LNG imports and also [[10:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37817.54s)]
*  nuclear that we are trying to develop. [[10:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37824.32s)]
*  I think there can be ways to work together. [[10:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37826.56s)]
*  And the Italian enterprises will invest as they've been [[10:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37830.22s)]
*  doing for many years. [[10:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37836.7s)]
*  As you know, in the next year is, I think, around [[10:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37838.4s)]
*  10 billions. [[10:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37841.7s)]
*  That shows how interconnected our economies are. [[10:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37843.14s)]
*  And that's very important, Mr. President. [[10:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37846.78s)]
*  It's not only about Italy. [[10:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37848.78s)]
*  It's about the entire Europe. [[10:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37850.38s)]
*  The exchange between us is a very big one. [[10:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37852.96s)]
*  Investments, trade. [[10:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37859.22s)]
*  It's a topic that we are discussing in the week. [[10:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37862.5s)]
*  But at the end of the day, look, somebody calls me. [[10:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37865.86s)]
*  I was saying it before such a Western nationalism. [[10:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37868.2s)]
*  I don't know if it is the right word, but I know that [[10:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37871.64s)]
*  when I speak about West, mainly I don't speak about [[10:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37875.18s)]
*  geographical space. [[10:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37877.979999999996s)]
*  I speak about the civilization. [[10:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37879.479999999996s)]
*  And I want to make that civilization stronger. [[10:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37881.92s)]
*  So I think even if we have some problems between the [[10:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=37884.119999999995s)]

*  These are countries with long lives. [[10:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38319.42s)]
*  And I terminated that. [[10:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38321.92s)]

*  millions of people — many millions of people — [[10:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38398.0s)]

*  Okay. [[10:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38544.520000000004s)]
*  The Press. [[10:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38545.18s)]
*  Mr. President, you did say that you were confident [[10:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38545.86s)]
*  these deals would be done. [[10:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38551.32s)]
*  But you also said that you're a no-brush. [[10:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38552.3s)]
*  Americans are seeing prices rise. [[10:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38553.96s)]
*  They're seeing it on their bills. [[10:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38555.66s)]
*  How long can they expect that pain to last? [[10:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38557.060000000005s)]
*  So, they've already seen it get much better, because [[10:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38560.74s)]
*  if you were truthful — which you're not, you [[10:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38565.08s)]
*  know, I know you very well — you have gasoline that [[10:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38566.880000000005s)]
*  hit a dollar and 98 yesterday in a couple of [[10:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38571.24s)]
*  states. [[10:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38574.42s)]
*  You have gasoline is way down. [[10:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38575.42s)]
*  The price of oil has dropped substantially. [[10:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38576.86s)]
*  The price of groceries are substantially down. [[10:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38580.88s)]
*  The price of eggs — you know, when I came in, [[10:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38584.06s)]
*  they hit me with eggs. [[10:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38587.76s)]
*  I just got there. [[10:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38589.6s)]
*  I was here for one week, and they started screaming at [[10:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38590.4s)]
*  me, eggs have gone through the roof. [[10:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38592.56s)]
*  I said, I just got here. [[10:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38594.3s)]
*  I was there for seven days, and I hear that eggs [[10:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38596.1s)]
*  have gone through the roof before I got there. [[10:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38599.0s)]
*  And they were screaming at me, the press — the [[10:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38601.44s)]
*  fake news, like you. [[10:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38603.44s)]
*  You're fake. [[10:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38604.48s)]
*  And the fake news is screaming at me, like, [[10:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38605.54s)]
*  about eggs. [[10:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38608.58s)]
*  I said, I've only been here. [[10:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38609.24s)]
*  I just — this is my seventh day. [[10:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38610.7s)]
*  And they were right. [[10:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38613.2s)]
*  They went up 87 percent, and you couldn't get them. [[10:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38613.9s)]
*  They said, You won't have eggs for Easter, which is [[10:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38616.38s)]
*  coming up. [[10:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38618.78s)]
*  Happy Easter, everybody. [[10:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38619.44s)]
*  You won't have eggs for Easter. [[10:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38621.04s)]
*  And we did an unbelievable job. [[10:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38623.24s)]
*  And now eggs are all over the place, and the price [[10:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38624.72s)]
*  went down 92 percent. [[10:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38627.46s)]
*  And our Commissioner of Agriculture, Brooke, has [[10:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38629.82s)]
*  done a fantastic job. [[10:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38633.56s)]
*  They really have done a fantastic job. [[10:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38635.96s)]
*  So prices have gone up. [[10:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38637.72s)]
*  The only thing that's gone up, actually, is interest [[10:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38639.1s)]
*  rates, because we have a Federal Reserve Chairman [[10:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38641.5s)]
*  that is playing politics — somebody that I've never [[10:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38644.4s)]
*  been very fond of, actually. [[10:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38648.54s)]
*  But he's playing politics. [[10:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38650.54s)]
*  Interest rates should be down now. [[10:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38653.1s)]
*  They should be coming down. [[10:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38654.68s)]
*  In Europe, as you know, they reduced them, I guess, [[10:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38656.78s)]
*  seven times. [[10:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38659.94s)]
*  It looks like they're going to reduce them again and [[10:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38660.78s)]
*  again and again. [[10:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38662.520000000004s)]
*  But our guy wants to play cute. [[10:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38663.98s)]
*  But interest rates are pretty much even. [[10:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38666.44s)]
*  Maybe they went up just a slight bit, but that's the [[10:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38670.520000000004s)]
*  only thing. [[10:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38672.54s)]
*  But that's because of the Federal Reserve, because [[10:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38673.22s)]
*  they're not very smart people. [[10:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38676.08s)]
*  Go ahead. [[10:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38677.42s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[10:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38678.12s)]
*  Please. [[10:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38678.78s)]
*  Go ahead. [[10:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38679.46s)]
*  Please. [[10:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38680.12s)]
*  Look, in the first four years, we had the greatest [[10:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38680.8s)]
*  economy in the history of our country. [[10:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38691.06s)]
*  The stock market went up 88 points. [[10:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38692.66s)]
*  I think he's terrible, but I can't complain because [[10:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38695.68s)]
*  we had the most successful administration [[10:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38698.86s)]
*  economically in the history of our country. [[10:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38700.82s)]
*  I think we're going to do even better this time, [[10:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38703.96s)]
*  because you will see that the numbers that we're [[10:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38705.86s)]
*  taking in are astronomical. [[10:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38709.159999999996s)]
*  We're taking in tremendous amounts of money [[10:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38710.84s)]
*  with the tariffs. [[10:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38712.9s)]
*  We were treated very unfairly on trade. [[10:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38714.24s)]
*  And countries are having a hard time getting used to [[10:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38716.94s)]
*  the fact that they can't do that to us anymore [[10:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38720.6s)]
*  because we have a real President. [[10:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38722.44s)]
*  We have a President that understands what it's all [[10:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38724.48s)]
*  about. [[10:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38727.86s)]
*  We had Presidents that, in some cases, were smart, [[10:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38728.520000000004s)]
*  but they didn't understand business, or they didn't [[10:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38732.600000000006s)]
*  like business, or, you know, it wasn't like a [[10:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38734.8s)]
*  priority. [[10:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38736.8s)]
*  And then you had, like, the last administration. [[10:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38738.16s)]
*  The only thing they were good at was cheating in [[10:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38740.100000000006s)]
*  elections. [[10:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38741.94s)]
*  That's about all they could do. [[10:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38742.600000000006s)]
*  They couldn't do anything that were useless. [[10:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38743.600000000006s)]
*  They were incompetent. [[10:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38745.100000000006s)]
*  Worst administration in the history of our country. [[10:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38746.14000000001s)]
*  Worst than Jimmy Carter. [[10:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38749.48s)]
*  Jimmy Carter died a happy man. [[10:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38750.54s)]
*  You know why? [[10:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38752.82s)]
*  Because he wasn't the worst President. [[10:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38754.36s)]
*  Joe Biden was. [[10:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38756.62s)]
*  So, I think you're going to see some fantastic numbers. [[10:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38758.659999999996s)]
*  When this all happens, it's happening now. [[10:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38762.56s)]
*  I mean, everybody wants to make a deal. [[10:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38764.7s)]
*  And if they don't want to make a deal, we'll make the [[10:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38766.44s)]
*  deal for them. [[10:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38768.54s)]
*  Because that's what's going to happen. [[10:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38769.7s)]
*  We're just saying this is what it is. [[10:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38771.04s)]
*  But we want to listen to everybody. [[10:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38773.34s)]
*  And I think I can say for Scott and the other people [[10:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38774.94s)]
*  that are working on it that we're listening and [[10:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38782.18s)]
*  we're going to be very fair to people. [[10:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38786.78s)]
*  But, you know, we're the one that really sets the [[10:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38788.32s)]
*  deal, and that's what we'll be doing. [[10:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38790.56s)]
*  Okay? [[10:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38792.56s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38793.22s)]
*  Please. [[10:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38797.02s)]
*  The Press. [[10:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38797.7s)]
*  Today, our Prime Minister. [[10:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38798.4s)]
*  Oh, you have a great Prime Minister. [[10:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38800.3s)]
*  You're so lucky. [[10:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38801.86s)]
*  Yes. [[10:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38802.66s)]
*  In Italian? [[10:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38803.340000000004s)]
*  Oh, yes, that's right. [[10:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38804.14s)]
*  Okay. [[10:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38805.14s)]
*  I'm not sure that would be. [[10:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38805.9s)]
*  President Veroni, I want to know what you think about the [[10:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38807.64s)]
*  fact that President Trump considered Zelensky responsible [[10:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38809.84s)]
*  for the Ukraine war. [[10:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38814.24s)]
*  And then, if you had talked about the expenses in Italy, [[10:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38815.68s)]
*  what is the maximum limit that you think Italy can reach [[10:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38818.68s)]
*  in terms of the expenses in Italy? [[10:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38822.28s)]
*  We've talked about the maximum limit that Italy can reach. [[10:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38824.12s)]
*  We've talked about the fact that Italy is keeping its [[10:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38826.52s)]
*  commitments because it will reach the next NATO advantage [[10:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38830.06s)]
*  with the 2 percent that was already planned, which was [[10:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38833.4s)]
*  signed by the previous governments, because we are a [[10:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38836.36s)]
*  serious nation, but we haven't talked about how much this [[10:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38839.76s)]
*  percentage will increase, even if we are obviously aware that [[10:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38844.020000000004s)]
*  the defense issue is a particularly important topic [[10:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38846.5s)]

*  As for the Ukraine war, as I think, I think there was [[10:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38850.14s)]
*  clearly an invasion and that the invader, from that point of [[10:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38853.840000000004s)]
*  view, was Putin and Russia, but that's not what reveals the [[10:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38859.74s)]
*  fact that together we want to work, we are working to try to [[10:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38866.12s)]
*  achieve in Ukraine a peace that can be right and lasting. [[10:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38870.280000000006s)]
*  I think these are the efforts on which we share our work. [[10:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38873.68s)]
*  We have also shared our voice today. [[10:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38878.62s)]
*  That sounded absolutely... [[10:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38880.56s)]
*  That was so beautiful. [[10:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38887.659999999996s)]
*  What the hell was that? [[10:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38888.86s)]
*  What did she say? [[10:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38890.82s)]
*  Please. [[10:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38891.619999999995s)]
*  No, I mean, it sounded great. [[10:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38893.06s)]
*  It was beautifully presented, but maybe I could hear what [[10:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38895.259999999995s)]
*  she said. [[10:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38900.24s)]
*  Please, go ahead. [[10:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38901.14s)]

*  Thank you. [[10:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38908.28s)]
*  No, no, wait. [[10:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38909.32s)]
*  I want to hear what she said. [[10:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38911.06s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38914.1s)]
*  The Press. [[10:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38915.9s)]
*  Prime Minister Maloney was asked what she thinks about the fact [[10:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38917.0s)]
*  that President Trump holds Zelensky responsible for the [[10:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38919.799999999996s)]
*  war in Ukraine, and Prime Minister Maloney answered, [[10:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38924.68s)]
*  well, actually, we have a... [[10:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38929.479999999996s)]
*  And also, you talked about the military spending and the raising [[10:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38936.64s)]
*  of the military spending. [[10:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38942.14s)]
*  And the first thing Prime Minister Maloney said is that, [[10:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38943.58s)]
*  no, actually, we didn't talk about the raise of military [[10:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38948.12s)]
*  spending. [[10:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38951.82s)]
*  Of course, Italy will keep its commitments with 2 percent, [[10:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38952.52s)]
*  and then we will see, because we are absolutely aware of the [[10:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38956.56s)]
*  fact that it is very important to... [[10:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38959.32s)]
*  Well, I will do that. [[10:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38963.159999999996s)]
*  Defense is very important. [[10:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38964.1s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[10:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38965.1s)]
*  They've been asking if we decided another defense [[10:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38965.880000000005s)]
*  percentage about the defense spending. [[10:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38969.32s)]
*  And I said, yes, NATO. [[10:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38973.62s)]
*  And I said that Italy is reaching the 2 percent as it [[10:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38975.36s)]
*  was already decided. [[10:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38978.700000000004s)]
*  We didn't speak about the specific other percentage, [[10:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38980.96000000001s)]
*  but we are aware of the fact that defense is important for [[10:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38985.0s)]
*  the future, and we see also the work that we are trying to do [[10:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38989.240000000005s)]
*  at the European level. [[10:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38992.840000000004s)]
*  And I don't hold Zelensky responsible, but I'm not exactly [[10:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=38995.12s)]
*  thrilled with the fact that that war started. [[10:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39002.0s)]
*  That was a war that would have never started if I were [[10:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39004.240000000005s)]
*  President. [[10:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39007.380000000005s)]
*  You'd have millions of people living right now that are dead. [[10:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39008.04s)]
*  You'd have cities that would be open and thriving, and they'd [[10:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39011.280000000006s)]
*  have their beautiful terraces. [[10:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39013.780000000006s)]
*  Those terraces are the most beautiful in the world, but [[10:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39015.32s)]
*  they're not with us any longer. [[10:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39018.380000000005s)]
*  They're smashed to smithereens, laying on the ground in a [[10:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39019.68s)]
*  million pieces, getting hit by rockets, bombs, and bullets. [[10:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39023.46s)]
*  And so I'm not happy with him, and I'm not happy with anybody [[10:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39028.4s)]
*  involved. [[10:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39033.299999999996s)]
*  I think it's a war. [[10:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39033.9s)]
*  I know it's a war. [[10:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39035.04s)]
*  It didn't happen for four years. [[10:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39036.08s)]
*  It was never close to happening. [[10:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39037.54s)]
*  It was never even a thought. [[10:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39038.939999999995s)]
*  And I spoke to President Putin about it a lot. [[10:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39040.92s)]
*  It was the apple of his eye. [[10:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39043.119999999995s)]
*  But there's no way he would have ever gone in if I were [[10:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39044.24s)]
*  President. [[10:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39046.92s)]
*  Now I'm trying to get him to stop, because, as you know, [[10:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39047.619999999995s)]
*  Russia's a lot bigger. [[10:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39052.5s)]
*  It's a bigger military force. [[10:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39055.0s)]
*  And if you're smart, you don't go involved and get involved in [[10:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39057.54s)]
*  wars that you can blame the man that was sitting in this [[10:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39062.78s)]
*  seat, Biden. [[10:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39065.979999999996s)]
*  He didn't know what the hell was going on. [[10:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39067.479999999996s)]
*  But I can guarantee you that — and everybody agrees to it — [[10:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39069.28s)]
*  if I were President, that war would have never taken place. [[10:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39072.54s)]
*  I'm not blaming him. [[10:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39075.12s)]
*  But what I am saying is that I wouldn't say he's done the [[10:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39076.979999999996s)]
*  greatest job. [[10:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39080.26s)]

*  You've seen — you've all seen how the policies of the [[10:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39197.74s)]
*  European Union in the last, let's say, two and a half years [[10:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39200.659999999996s)]
*  have been changing. [[10:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39203.86s)]
*  Okay, at the beginning, we were talking only about how we were [[10:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39204.86s)]
*  redistributing illegal migrants coming to Italy. [[10:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39208.8s)]
*  Now we are talking mainly about how to stop illegal migration, [[10:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39211.74s)]
*  work with the countries of origin and transit, [[10:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39216.28s)]
*  and to return people. [[10:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39219.58s)]
*  The European Commission just did the new rules about [[10:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39220.78s)]
*  repatriations and things like that. [[10:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39225.92s)]
*  So things are changing. [[10:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39227.76s)]
*  Thanks also to the example that Italy brought in lowering the [[10:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39229.8s)]
*  rates of illegal migration. [[10:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39234.78s)]
*  So they — we are working now together. [[10:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39237.020000000004s)]
*  So I'm optimistic on that. [[10:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39240.380000000005s)]
*  The President's voice is heard. [[10:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39242.12s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39243.520000000004s)]
*  Go ahead. [[10:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39246.96s)]
*  I'd like to ask, President Romani, [[10:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39247.96s)]
*  if you have discussed an option of starting here with [[10:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39251.1s)]
*  Italy on black communications, and President Trump, [[10:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39254.0s)]
*  if you want to see the Google company — [[10:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39258.06s)]
*  The Google what? [[10:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39260.06s)]
*  The Google company. [[10:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39263.06s)]
*  What about — [[10:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39264.06s)]
*  The Google business. [[10:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39265.06s)]
*  I want to see it now. [[10:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39266.06s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[10:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39267.06s)]
*  Oh, well, we didn't discuss about Starlink. [[10:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39269.06s)]
*  We've been discussing about defense space. [[10:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39272.1s)]
*  We will work together also in the Mars missions. [[10:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39275.84s)]
*  So there are big, big things to do together, [[10:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39280.38s)]
*  but we didn't discuss it. [[10:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39284.08s)]
*  I have a question. [[10:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39286.76s)]
*  Did you hear from the ministers, [[10:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39288.76s)]
*  from the minister, that changed your mind potentially [[10:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39291.240000000005s)]
*  about tariffs and what you can do going forward? [[10:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39293.240000000005s)]
*  The President, did the minister say to you that changed your — [[10:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39295.740000000005s)]
*  No. [[10:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39298.22s)]
*  Tariffs are making us rich. [[10:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39298.68s)]
*  We were losing a lot of money under Biden — [[10:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39300.32s)]
*  trillions of dollars, trillions on trade. [[10:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39304.68s)]
*  And now that's — that whole tide has turned. [[10:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39308.42s)]
*  We're making a lot of money. [[10:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39311.36s)]
*  We're taking in a lot of money. [[10:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39313.12s)]
*  Don't forget, we're taking in 25 percent on cars, [[10:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39314.14s)]
*  25 percent on steel, 25 percent on aluminum, 10 percent baseline. [[10:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39317.280000000006s)]
*  We put penalties on China for sending us fentanyl. [[10:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39323.18s)]
*  We put penalties on Mexico and Canada, [[10:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39326.420000000006s)]
*  25 percent for allowing fentanyl [[10:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39329.520000000004s)]
*  and allowing the borders to be weak. [[10:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39333.920000000006s)]
*  Now, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars [[10:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39337.200000000004s)]
*  while I sit here and talk to you. [[10:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39339.560000000005s)]
*  And we didn't do — we didn't take in anything before, [[10:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39342.92s)]
*  other than the tariffs that I put on previous to Biden, [[10:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39345.6s)]
*  which were the tariffs I put on China, [[10:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39348.799999999996s)]
*  where we took in, up until this point, [[10:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39350.439999999995s)]
*  probably $700 billion. [[10:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39352.659999999996s)]
*  They were Trump tariffs. [[10:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39355.53999999999s)]
*  He tried to weaken them. [[10:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39356.799999999996s)]
*  He did everything he could. [[10:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39358.799999999996s)]
*  You know, he got paid money by China, right? [[10:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39360.0s)]
*  The family got paid money. He did. [[10:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39361.799999999996s)]
*  And so, I don't know, maybe that was the reason [[10:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39364.64s)]
*  or maybe it wasn't. [[10:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39367.53999999999s)]
*  But he tried to weaken them, but he couldn't [[10:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39368.479999999996s)]
*  because there was so much money that his budgets — [[10:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39370.58s)]
*  you know, they couldn't stand not doing it. [[10:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39373.66s)]
*  But I took in, in the — up till this point, [[10:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39376.82s)]
*  my tariffs on China. [[10:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39381.700000000004s)]
*  Nobody ever took in 10 cents from China. [[10:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39383.200000000004s)]
*  No other president took in 10 cents. [[10:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39385.4s)]
*  I took in more than $700 billion from China. [[10:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39387.04s)]
*  So, we're doing very well. [[10:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39390.54s)]
*  I mean, our country is doing very well. [[10:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39393.68s)]
*  They had a bad report today [[10:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39395.78s)]
*  from one of the healthcare companies [[10:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39398.08s)]
*  that had an impact on the stock market. [[10:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39400.98s)]
*  But this is about that. [[10:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39402.82s)]
*  This is really — we're building a base. [[10:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39404.520000000004s)]
*  We're building a country like no other. [[10:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39406.38s)]
*  And again, I had the strongest economy [[10:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39408.82s)]
*  in the history of our country by far — [[10:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39411.06s)]
*  history of any country, probably, [[10:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39413.16s)]
*  but the history of our country in four years. [[10:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39414.700000000004s)]
*  And I think this has a chance to be much better. [[10:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39417.66s)]
*  The Press. [[10:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39420.04s)]
*  I don't know exactly. I'm going to leave that to Scott. [[10:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7i3pWs7fUI&t=39430.22s)]
