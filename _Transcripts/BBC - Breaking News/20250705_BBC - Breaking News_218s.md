# Texas floods: Nine children among 27 dead as search continues for missing girls | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [July 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg)
*  The authorities in the US state of Texas say at least 27 people including nine children have died after torrential rain led to flash flooding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=0.0s)]
*  The Guadalupe River rose eight meters in just 45 minutes, sweeping through campsites busy for the fourth of July holiday. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=9.0s)]
*  More than 20 children are missing from the all-girl camp Mystic summer camp. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=16.0s)]
*  And the Vice President, JD Vance, has described the situation as an incomprehensible tragedy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=21.0s)]
*  Well in the last hour the authorities gave an update on the current rescue and recovery efforts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=27.0s)]
*  They are going to be in very debris terrain, very difficult challenging contours along the river banks. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=32.0s)]
*  So it is a very harsh environment. We are doing what's called a primary search which is basically a very quick search. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=39.0s)]
*  But when I say quick that is up, down, sideways, they're turning over as many rocks as they can, culverts up in trees. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=46.0s)]
*  They are looking at every possible location and then we'll start going into a layered approach. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=53.0s)]
*  I'm thankful you're here. Today will be a hard day. Please pray for our community. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=59.0s)]
*  The latest on the emergency response, Nick Johnson reports. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=73.0s)]
*  Swathes of central Texas remain underwater following flash floods which have devastated lives and upended homes. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=78.0s)]
*  It's like this for miles and miles. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=88.0s)]
*  750 girls were attending this riverside holiday camp near the town of Kerrville. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=93.0s)]
*  This used to be a campground. These are all campsites. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=99.0s)]
*  At least 20 of them are missing after flood water swept away much of the campsite. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=103.0s)]
*  Families await news. As authorities stress, the lack of contact may be because the children are out of communication rather than lost. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=108.0s)]
*  We will rescue those in peril and we will find those who are missing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=117.0s)]
*  But I'd also ask, please pray for our community. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=125.0s)]
*  Torrential rain caused the Guadalupe River to burst its banks after rising 26 feet about the height of a two-story house in under an hour. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=131.0s)]
*  Flood water cascades into homes. Roads, vehicles, holiday cabins and houses are washed away. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=142.0s)]
*  I'm homeless. It floated down the river maybe 80 yards and these two trees, it just lodged in between two trees. So it's not going anywhere anymore. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=151.0s)]
*  Speaking on board Air Force One, President Trump indicated he'd direct federal aid to the relief efforts. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=163.0s)]
*  Oh yes, we'll take care of it. We're working with the governor. It's a terrible thing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=170.0s)]
*  Boats, drones and helicopters are being used to find survivors. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=178.0s)]
*  So we're waiting on water rescue if anyone has any boats or jet skis. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=183.0s)]
*  Some remain stranded, the only safe spot for this family on the roof of their house. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=188.0s)]
*  The rescue effort is being made more difficult after roads were washed away. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=194.0s)]
*  And in a part of Texas which is hundreds of miles from the sea, the US Coast Guard is being deployed to help the search. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=199.0s)]
*  A state of emergency has been declared in several counties and the Texas governor wants people to pray for the missing. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlYKX8ZwTNg&t=207.0s)]
