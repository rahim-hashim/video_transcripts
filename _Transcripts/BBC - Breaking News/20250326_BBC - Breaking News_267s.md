Video Description: The Sudanese army has told the BBC it has recaptured the airport in the capital, Khartoum, from the paramilitary RSF, marking its latest territorial gain in the brutal two-year civil war.
 
Gen Mahomed Abdel Rahman al-Bilawi said troops had fully secured it and might be able to clear the rest of the RSF fighters by the end of day.
 
The army has been moving swiftly since recapturing the presidential palace on Friday, and civilians have been celebrating in the streets as it advances.
 
The RSF had controlled most of the capital since the war began in April 2023. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands have been killed, and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
 
Some 12 million Sudanese people have fled their homes since war broke out - that is equivalent to Belgium or Tunisia's entire population.

**BBC - Breaking News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw)
*  You now are on the war in Sudan. The Sydney's army has retaken full control, we understand, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=0.0s)]
*  of the airport in central Khartoum from the paramilitary rapid support forces. A commander [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=5.04s)]
*  on the ground, General Mohammed Abdul Rahman al-Balawi, has told the BBC the airport was [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=10.16s)]
*  fully secured and the military was moving swiftly to clear the rest of the city. Let's take you to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  our Africa correspondent Barbara Platt-Asher who joins us now from Port Sudan. This is a major [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=20.8s)]
*  development. Barbara, what are you hearing from Khartoum? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=25.52s)]
*  That the army has been moving really quickly today and made a lot of gains in Khartoum, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=31.2s)]
*  the key one being taking control of the airport in the central part of the city. There had been [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=35.92s)]
*  still fighters stationed there and the commander on the ground told us that that has been now [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=40.8s)]
*  fully secured as he put it and troops have been moving swiftly to take other remaining holdouts [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=45.28s)]
*  of the RSF. The military spokesman said that they had gained control of a camp, a military camp, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=52.08s)]
*  where the RSF was located in what has been its last remaining stronghold in the southern part [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=58.08s)]
*  of the city. So the commander told me that they're conducting clearing operations and they might be [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=62.72s)]
*  possible for them to announce full control of Khartoum by the end of the day and you may recall [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=68.88s)]
*  on Friday they had made a really big advance seizing the presidential palace in the centre [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=74.72s)]
*  of the city and so these further moves have received momentum from that and they have been [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=79.68s)]
*  moving quite quickly. Barbara, we're also hearing that there are celebrations on the streets as the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  army moves in. What has life been like in Khartoum? It's been very, very difficult. We've heard many [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=91.44000000000001s)]
*  stories and testimonies from people in the various residential areas of Khartoum that have been [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=102.0s)]
*  slowly cleared over the past weeks and months. Stories about RSF fighters looting, harassing people, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=110.0s)]
*  damaging buildings, the threat of rape of women. Some of the areas have been better than others. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=119.76s)]
*  In some areas there has been a bit of an ability to create a working relationship with them on [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=126.0s)]
*  certain things but by and large the stories that I have heard have been that people just did not [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=131.44s)]
*  feel safe, that they lost many, many things to the stealing and the looting and that now that the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=136.56s)]
*  army was beginning to take control they were feeling that they could actually sleep at night. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=141.68s)]
*  So the celebrations that we have been seeing on videos posted online, these are people who [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=146.72s)]
*  have really feel that they have been released from something that's been very difficult. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=155.68s)]
*  Bearing in mind though you see that the war is not over. If the army does get full control of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  the capital, which it seems it will, then it will probably shift to Darfur, the western region which [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=165.04s)]
*  the RSF mostly has control of. What are we hearing from that part of Darfur? It's a really important [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=172.0s)]
*  point to make Barbara that the RSF does still control almost all of that region at the moment. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=177.2s)]
*  What's been happening there? Well the most recent news we had was that there was a bombing of a very [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=182.0s)]
*  busy market on Monday night and the reports coming out of there were that many, many people [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=189.84s)]
*  had been killed. The groups that initially broke the news blamed it on an army bombing, an army [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=195.12s)]
*  airstrike on the market, which the army denied. The army said it didn't attack civilians, it [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  targeted legitimate military targets but we are still trying to determine exactly how many people [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=208.08s)]
*  were killed. The numbers have ranged from about 60 to 270 from reports quoting witnesses and [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=214.0s)]
*  residents on the ground. So quite a catastrophic event and that is just north Lucy of the city of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=223.04s)]
*  Al-Fasher which is the state capital for north Darfur, the last capital that the army still has [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=228.96s)]
*  control of because as I said the RSF basically controls most of the Darfur region. The fighting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=234.72s)]
*  there has been just very grim. The RSF has besieged the capital for nearly a year now and it's in this [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=240.72s)]
*  area, in the camps around this area that the UN has declared there are famine conditions. So a lot of [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=247.76s)]
*  the focus of the fighting has been in this north Darfur state. Yes in case our viewers needed [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=253.6s)]
*  reminding the UN saying this is the world's largest humanitarian crisis in Sudan at the moment. Barbara [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=258.4s)]
*  thank you so much for joining us from Port Sudan. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsecEQmK4Kw&t=264.24s)]
