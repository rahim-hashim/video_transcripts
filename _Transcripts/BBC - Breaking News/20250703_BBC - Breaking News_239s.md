*  Well, that news, of course, just coming into us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=100.0s)]
*  Let's go straight to our sports correspondent, Hugh Ferris, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=104.0s)]
*  who joins us from the BBC Sports Centre in Salford. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=108.0s)]

*  Diogo Jota and his brother killed in a car crash involving a Lamborghini. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=115.0s)]
*  Hugely significant because Diogo Jota was such a rising star in sport, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=122.0s)]
*  a real success for Liverpool. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=129.0s)]
*  Yes, that's right, Regine. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=131.0s)]
*  He killed at the age of 28. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=133.0s)]
*  These reports coming into us initially from the Spanish-language newspaper [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=135.0s)]
*  Marca, quoting local authorities in that Zamora region, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=140.0s)]
*  which talked of a crash involving the death of a 28- and 26-year-old, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=143.0s)]
*  his brother, a younger brother, also a footballer, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=148.0s)]
*  although one that had not risen to the heights of Diogo Jota. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=151.0s)]
*  Liverpool player, he's been there since 2020. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=155.0s)]
*  Liverpool paid more than Â£40 million to sign him from Wolverham to [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=159.0s)]
*  Wanderers, having helped them get promoted to the Premier League [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=163.0s)]
*  since when he has been playing for the Premier League club, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=166.0s)]
*  winning three major trophies as well, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=169.0s)]
*  not least the Premier League title just in the last few months. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=171.0s)]
*  The Marca reports talked of the location of the accident being on [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=175.0s)]
*  the A52. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=179.0s)]
*  It is a significant road running east to west in the north-western [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=180.0s)]
*  part of Spain, that he was in the car with his younger brother near [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=185.0s)]
*  Palacios de Senebria, which is a very small local town just north of [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=190.0s)]
*  the A52. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=195.0s)]
*  He is a player who has played 49 times for Portugal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=197.0s)]
*  He's won the Nations League, the UEFA tournament, twice, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=201.0s)]
*  including just in the last few weeks, laterally, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=204.0s)]
*  for the second time for Portugal. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=207.0s)]
*  He is a player who, perhaps not in the starting 11 over the last season, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=210.0s)]
*  but very much one of the squad that has been so successful, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=214.0s)]
*  particularly in the last 12 months under the new manager, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=218.0s)]

*  posting on Twitter just celebrating his recent marriage. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=228.0s)]
*  It is a tragic day for him, for his family, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=232.0s)]
*  and for Liverpool, for the club. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_Ch4nSAq4E&t=235.0s)]
