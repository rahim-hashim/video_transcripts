# Sean 'Diddy' Combs found guilty on two out of five charges | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk)
*  So, just to recap there, so he has been found not guilty in racketeering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=0.0s)]
*  conspiracy, that was the more serious charges we were talking about. He's [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=5.44s)]
*  been found not guilty of sex trafficking his former girlfriend, that's [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=9.92s)]
*  Cassandra Ventura who was the prosecution's star witness. He has been [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=13.84s)]
*  found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution regarding [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=18.84s)]
*  the case of Cassandra Ventura. He has been found not guilty in the sex [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=25.28s)]
*  trafficking of his former girlfriend, Jane, that was the pseudonym that [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=31.04s)]
*  she had during the trial. So that's four charges, so we're just waiting [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=37.32s)]
*  for the fifth one. And just to let you know, on the racketeering [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  conspiracy, that was the one that the jury was really struggling to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=47.92s)]
*  reach a verdict on. That was the more serious one as we were talking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=50.72s)]
*  there, the Rico charge, where the prosecution claims that he ran his [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=55.4s)]
*  enterprise as some sort of criminal enterprise. We're still waiting to, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=61.04s)]
*  and we'll obviously bring you what reaction, there are of course no [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=68.12s)]
*  cameras allowed in the courthouse. And he's been found, so one, two, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=72.52s)]
*  three, guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution regarding his [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=78.48s)]
*  former girlfriend, Jane. So let me just recap that. So there's not [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=83.16s)]
*  guilty, one, two, three not guilty verdicts. Three not guilty verdicts [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=88.16s)]
*  there and two guilty verdicts. So the not guilty verdicts are to do with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=94.56s)]
*  the racketeering conspiracy, the sex trafficking of both women in this [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=100.28s)]
*  case, and the guilty verdicts of transportation to engage in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=103.84s)]
*  prostitution regarding Cassandra Ventura and the other woman who went [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=107.48s)]
*  by the pseudonym Jane. So guilty of transportation to engage in [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=112.48s)]
*  transportation for prostitution, this is punishable by up to ten years in [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  prison. We don't know yet what the sentence is. But the guilty one so [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=123.28s)]
*  far means a maximum sentence of ten years. And so he's been found guilty [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=129.68s)]
*  on those two charges. So that's what we're hearing so far. And as I [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=134.88s)]
*  mentioned, his family is obviously, he's in court, his family is in [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=142.0s)]
*  court, we're not getting much reaction. I just want to give you a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=144.88s)]
*  sense of what it's like. I'm out here, we have our digital team, BBC's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=148.36s)]
*  digital team inside the courtroom, and they are updating us on what is [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=151.88s)]
*  happening inside the courtroom. But just to recap again, he has been [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=157.32s)]
*  found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution, two charges, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  to do with Cassandra Ventura, his ex-girlfriend of more than ten years, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=170.84s)]
*  who was at the heart of the prosecution's case, and in reference to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  his former girlfriend, Jane. That was a pseudonym that she was given. So [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=178.28s)]
*  just to wrap, just to sort of sum it up, the jury has reached a verdict on [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=185.36s)]
*  all counts. They have found Sean Combs not guilty on counts one, two [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=188.84s)]
*  and four, and guilty on counts three and five. So we'll wait to see what [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=193.36s)]
*  sentence he actually gets. But I think this would be seen as a partial [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  victory, of course, for the prosecution. Not a full victory. They had really [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=205.32s)]
*  gone hard on Sean Combs in terms of that racketeering conspiracy, the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=210.4s)]
*  jury did not accept the government's case, they didn't think that it was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=214.72s)]
*  proven beyond a reasonable doubt that he was using his fame and wealth to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=219.8s)]
*  carry out a criminal enterprise in terms of the allegations that he is [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=224.96s)]
*  accused of. So in terms of the guilty charges, it is possible across [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=232.24s)]
*  those both counts he could be facing 20 years in prison, but we haven't [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=237.16s)]
*  touched the sentencing parts yet. I think, Nomiya, it is just worth [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=241.0s)]
*  reminding our audience what is happening, because of course we have [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=246.4s)]
*  been waiting for so much time to get this verdict through on the Sean [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=250.12s)]
*  Diddy Combs case. So just to go through what we have learnt so far, as [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=258.96s)]
*  Nomiya was saying, the jury is now back and they have returned a verdict of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=266.68s)]
*  not guilty on the first count of racketeering on counts two and four, and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=272.08s)]
*  that is of sex trafficking of Casey Ventura and also Jane, the two witnesses [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=279.12s)]
*  at the centre of this, the jury has found Combs not guilty. And then he [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=284.08s)]
*  has been found guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=290.36s)]
*  prostitution relating to Casey Ventura and also to the witness known as [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=295.08s)]
*  Jane. Breaking news from the court in New York where the jury has now [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=301.88s)]
*  reached verdicts in the sex trafficking trial of Sean Diddy Combs. So one [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=308.91999999999996s)]
*  more time, on the charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=315.24s)]
*  Cassandra Ventura and also the woman known as Jane, Sean Diddy Combs has [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=318.28s)]
*  been found not guilty. But on the charge of transportation to engage in [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=323.4s)]
*  prostitution related to Cassandra Ventura and Jane, Sean Diddy Combs has [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=330.67999999999995s)]
*  been found guilty. So that live breaking news from New York on the case of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=336.52s)]
*  Sean Diddy Combs. I'm joined by Rhianna Croxford who is our correspondent who [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=348.92s)]
*  has just been with us listening to this and I know you've been extensively [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=356.56s)]
*  looking at this case. There's going to be disappointment when it comes to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=360.12s)]
*  some of these, what the jury has found, especially when it comes to that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=364.44s)]
*  complicated charge of racketeering. This will no doubt be seen as a victory [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  for Sean Combs' team. Transportation to engage in prostitution carried the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=375.44s)]
*  least amount in terms of jail time that he could have served. Now, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=381.0s)]
*  obviously, let's rewind. Central to this case was this idea that Combs [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=385.56s)]
*  had forced or coerced his former partners into so-called freak-offs, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=390.6s)]
*  these prolonged drug-fuelled sexual encounters with male escorts that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=396.15999999999997s)]
*  prosecutors had argued that his former partners had been forced into. We've [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=401.52000000000004s)]
*  heard over the past seven weeks from more than 30 witnesses, we've heard [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=407.04s)]
*  very harrowing testimony as well from Cassandra Ventura, his former partner [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=412.08000000000004s)]
*  who detailed how humiliating these encounters were, how painful these [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  encounters were. She said they could sometimes go on for days on end. Now, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=423.40000000000003s)]
*  it's quite striking that he's been found not guilty of racketeering and [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=429.04s)]
*  also sex trafficking. I mean, if we're going to unpack those laws a bit [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=433.92s)]
*  under US law, racketeering is a charge that has long been associated with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=438.04s)]
*  mob or mafia bosses. It's this idea that he ran a criminal enterprise, say, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=443.72s)]
*  that involved many of his staff to help him conceal and also carry out a [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=448.88s)]
*  number of crimes. We now know that's not the case, according to the jury's [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=453.92s)]
*  verdict. Sex trafficking is this idea that you could get an adult to engage [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=457.84s)]
*  in sex for money through either force, fraud or coercion. Coercion being this [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=463.11999999999995s)]
*  idea that you could come to physical harm if you don't go through with [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=468.15999999999997s)]
*  something or even emotional harm or reputational harm. So, one has to [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=472.44s)]
*  wonder how exactly the prosecution feel, but also how the victims in this case [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=477.67999999999995s)]
*  feel, having spent weeks testifying in such graphic detail about their [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=483.28s)]
*  experiences. But this will no doubt be seen as a victory for Combs. As [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=487.84s)]
*  Nomiya mentioned, the maximum amount of jail time he could face for [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=491.96s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution is 10 years. It was definitely [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=497.2s)]
*  the most minor offences that he'd been charged with. So, really is an [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=500.68s)]
*  extraordinary outcome. And I'm sure is that the minutes, the hours go on, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  we're going to get more and more reaction from his team and also from [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=510.88s)]
*  the victims in this case and also from the prosecution. Rihanna, thank you [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=514.32s)]
*  so much just for talking us through that. I know you've done an awful [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=518.2s)]
*  lot of work on this. You've been following this very closely. We're [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=520.76s)]
*  going to come back to you just to unpick some of this once more. But I [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=523.8s)]
*  can tell you from our team who are reporting from inside that New York [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=527.56s)]
*  court that as the verdict was read out, Combs remained stoic. He was [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=532.16s)]
*  apparently hard to read. He was staring forward and beforehand he was [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=539.24s)]
*  praying with his adult children and he was also hugging his lawyers. The [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=544.84s)]
*  judge then instructed the courtroom and also the overflow room to stay [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=550.2s)]
*  orderly. But there was an explosion of noise as the verdicts were delivered. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=553.92s)]
*  And our team inside the court, they were, they heard that noise after [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=561.08s)]
*  each decision was read out with supporters of Sean Diddy Combs [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=565.64s)]
*  cheering at the front of the court. And just I'll go through the the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=570.64s)]
*  verdicts in just a moment, but just to remind our audience, for those of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=576.48s)]
*  you joining us, that we've heard the verdict from the Sean Diddy Combs [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=580.32s)]
*  sex trafficking trial and just to explain that the details from this [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=586.96s)]
*  trial were difficult. They were grim. So some of you may find the details [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=592.24s)]
*  that we will be talking about distressing. So just warning you now of [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  that. But in brief, the music mogul Sean Diddy Combs has been found [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=601.12s)]
*  not guilty of racketeering, not guilty of sex trafficking, an ex partner [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  Cassandra Ventura and another woman who was referred to as Jane. He was [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=612.48s)]
*  found guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution relating to [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=618.4s)]
*  both of those women. Now I can tell you that each charge carries a [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=623.92s)]
*  maximum sentence of 10 years. We're yet to find the sentencing. He was [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=631.2s)]
*  cleared of three other counts, including sex trafficking, a former [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=635.8000000000001s)]
*  girlfriend, and this caps a seven week trial in which more than 30 [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=639.4s)]
*  witnesses were called. We can talk to Nicholas Tyrell Scott, who's a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=643.4s)]
*  London based music and culture journalist. You've been covering [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=647.92s)]
*  Nicholas Sean Combs is career, it's meteoric rise, and also it's for [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=651.04s)]
*  just your reaction to this verdict. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=657.64s)]
*  Um, I think, as you said, it's kind of remarkable that we got the most [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=662.4799999999999s)]
*  minor offense out of all counts of English charge that he was in court [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=667.4399999999999s)]
*  for these last few months. So yeah, it's an interesting one. And I'm [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=673.0s)]
*  intrigued to see the sentencing that comes from this in the coming [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=676.64s)]
*  hours and days. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=681.84s)]
*  I think it's worth just reminding our audience, Nicholas, the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=685.8s)]
*  background to Sean Diddy Combs. He is such a huge star. His music [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=691.1999999999999s)]
*  reaches so many people. He has so many fans. And like I was saying, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=696.36s)]
*  when when the verdicts were read out, his supporters in court burst [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=702.48s)]
*  into cheers. His career spanned many, many years and many and he was [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=706.9200000000001s)]
*  absolutely huge when it comes to the music industry. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=713.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was. He was notorious, unintended, you know, obviously, he [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=718.24s)]
*  was involved with notorious VIGs career. One of the many faces behind [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=723.52s)]
*  the instrumental with you know, the likes of Mary J. Blige, Mariah [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=728.52s)]
*  Carey, producer of like them, Total, Stevie J, The Logs. You can you can [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=731.8399999999999s)]
*  really just most people in hip hop and R&B have at least been in his [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=736.9599999999999s)]
*  periphery, which is why this case is so important. And I feel like why [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  it's been covered in such high degree, which is why this is breaking [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=745.3599999999999s)]
*  news because of his, his stature and what this might mean for things [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=748.16s)]
*  going forward in hip hop and R&B. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=753.64s)]
*  And when it comes to the power and the influence that he had, I wonder [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=756.84s)]
*  if you could just put this into context for us, given the the [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=763.24s)]
*  accusations were so serious. And okay, he has been found not guilty [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=767.2800000000001s)]
*  of racketeering conspiracy, not guilty of sex trafficking his former [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=773.0400000000001s)]
*  girlfriend Cassandra known as Casey Ventura, not guilty of sex [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=778.2800000000001s)]
*  trafficking his former girlfriend, a woman who was known in the [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=782.72s)]
*  court by the pseudonym as Jane, but he has been found guilty of the [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=785.32s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution, as it counts to [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=790.12s)]
*  Cassandra Casey Ventura, and he has been found guilty of [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=795.24s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution to the his former [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=798.6s)]
*  girlfriend who was known as under the pseudonym of Jane in court. He [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=802.84s)]
*  was extremely powerful. His reach was very, very broad. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=807.48s)]
*  Absolutely. I think as yeah, with with Cassie and Jane Doe and all of [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=811.56s)]
*  the kind of people touched, you know, that's why there was chatter of, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=817.0799999999999s)]
*  you know, the Diddy parties and investigations into that both through [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=821.3599999999999s)]
*  op-eds and through reports, formal reporting throughout this case as [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=825.1199999999999s)]
*  well. I think it's why you've got all eyes on it. And I think, you [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=829.0799999999999s)]
*  know, with the charges, he the charge he has kind of been found [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=832.68s)]
*  guilty of this this conflates with the Me Too era that's touching not [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=836.28s)]
*  only hip hop, but music and entertainment in Hollywood as well. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=840.92s)]
*  So someone like him facing jail time definitely it sounds like it will [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=844.16s)]
*  it will have serious ramifications for the industry and behaviour and, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=851.0s)]
*  you know, intersexual relationships and music relationships, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=855.3199999999999s)]
*  entertainment relationships and just how we navigate forward. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=859.4s)]
*  Yeah, going forward, it's it's it's quite astonishing to kind of see a [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=862.64s)]
*  case so big in recent years. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=866.12s)]
*  So just on that point, that's a really interesting point. So you think [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=868.6s)]
*  it will make it will make a difference? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=872.24s)]
*  I mean, there's we've been having the Me Too conversation since the late [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=876.6800000000001s)]
*  the latter half of the last decade, at least in popular culture. So I [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=880.6s)]
*  think with someone like him, there's continued conversations, it's [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=884.16s)]
*  breaking news right now on the light of the media, and I think that's [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=887.84s)]
*  it's breaking news right now on the likes of X, TikTok, Instagram, in [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=891.12s)]
*  group chats everywhere. The fact that we're covering it, the extent to [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=896.2800000000001s)]
*  which you just covered it and the station is covering it now, it will [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=899.88s)]
*  obviously have ramifications. And I think, you know, people already [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=903.9200000000001s)]
*  switching behaviours, changing behaviours, and just having discussions [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=909.24s)]
*  in the public domain. I think these weren't as large, you know, even five [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=913.0400000000001s)]
*  years ago to what we are to what we are experiencing now, even with Cassie, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=917.52s)]
*  you know, there was hearsay, but there was no kind of verified testimonies [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=922.44s)]
*  on the record in the five years that have come. She's obviously come to do [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=927.16s)]
*  that and people on her behalf as well. So it's really going to be an [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=931.08s)]
*  interesting one to see move forward. But yes, to answer your question, I [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=934.8000000000001s)]
*  do think there'll be conversations, I do think there'll be maybe new [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=938.72s)]
*  conventions. And I do think going forward with figures like Diddy, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=941.96s)]
*  seeing the courtrooms at least, there will be kind of a navigation of this [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=946.7199999999999s)]
*  new period and popular culture and the zeitgeist. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=952.04s)]
*  Really interesting points that you make, Nicholas Tyrell Scott. Thank you [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=955.3199999999999s)]
*  very much for joining us and your swift reaction there. London based music [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=958.76s)]
*  and culture journalist. He's been Nicholas Tyrell there covering Sean [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=962.76s)]
*  Diddy Combs for his rise and obviously now his fall. Fascinating insight [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=966.8s)]
*  there into the impact of this very difficult trial on the music industry. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=973.7199999999999s)]
*  I can tell you that the jury deliberated for 13 hours over three days [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  to come to what is a unanimous decision on the charges against Sean [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=984.5999999999999s)]
*  Diddy Combs. We can go back to my colleague, Nomiya Iqbal, who has been [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=990.3199999999999s)]
*  covering this and monitoring this from the very, very start. Nomiya, back [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=994.28s)]
*  to you. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=999.24s)]
*  Yes, the fate of one of the world's biggest hip hop stars has now been [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=999.6s)]
*  decided by a jury of eight men and four women and as you outlined there, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1006.9200000000001s)]
*  they took 13 hours. And we're talking about seven weeks of evidence, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1011.32s)]
*  harrowing evidence as you were spelling out there. But I want to [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1016.6800000000001s)]
*  bring in my colleague, Saqchi, who was also a reporter at the BBC and has [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1020.24s)]
*  been inside the courthouse from day one. Can we just start from the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1024.64s)]
*  beginning? Because when we got here this morning, the jury had returned, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1028.96s)]
*  they'd been told to go home, carry on deliberating. What was it that they [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1033.0800000000002s)]
*  were struggling to deliberate on? [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1037.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so last evening we heard that there was a deadlock on the [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1038.8000000000002s)]
*  racketeering charge, which is count one. By far the most serious charge [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1041.92s)]
*  carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. So yesterday evening, the [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1045.5600000000002s)]
*  judge received a note that the jury had a verdict on all other counts, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1049.4s)]
*  one through, or sorry, two through five, but couldn't reach a verdict on [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1052.52s)]
*  count one racketeering because people on both sides were unable to make up [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1055.76s)]
*  their minds or unable to move their positions. So we came back this morning [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1059.32s)]
*  and the jury continued deliberating and evidently they didn't need long. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1062.48s)]
*  It didn't take that long, did it? And you went, you were in the courtroom. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1065.4s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of what it was like in there? Because of course, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1069.1200000000001s)]
*  Sean Diddy Combs has been in jail since last September and he's been in [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1071.52s)]
*  that courthouse every day since the trial began. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1074.76s)]
*  Right, exactly. So the courtroom for the past couple of days has been [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1077.04s)]
*  quiet until it's not basically. The judge will receive a note from the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1080.2s)]
*  jury and then suddenly everybody will flood in, including Combs, his lawyers, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1084.24s)]
*  the family, the kids, his mom. So that's exactly what happened today. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1087.92s)]
*  That at around 10, the judge received a note. Combs came back in, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1091.4s)]
*  the lawyers came back in, the kids came back in. So we knew that something [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1096.2s)]
*  was about to happen. By the way, there was tension in the courtroom. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1099.1200000000001s)]
*  The lawyers were moving around. Combs was praying, the family was praying. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1102.04s)]
*  They all kind of had like a prayer session together. And then we sat down [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1106.24s)]
*  and we immediately heard from the judge that there was a verdict. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1110.6s)]
*  And it's interesting because it is a mixed bag, of course, in terms of the [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1113.8s)]
*  verdicts. But I also want you to give us a sense of what it's been like here. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  It's really hard to capture, isn't it? But just outside here, there's so much [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1122.04s)]
*  activity going on. It's not just us media here, right, the legacy media. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1127.1599999999999s)]
*  You've got influencers. Just give us a sense of what that's been like. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1131.48s)]
*  Yeah, so the crowd has been an extremely mixed bag of journalists, content [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1135.12s)]
*  creators, Diddy supporters and just members of the public or tourists who have [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1139.32s)]
*  come to sit in and kind of see these explosive proceedings. And it's been a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1142.88s)]
*  chaotic environment, especially for the past few days, as people wait to hear [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1146.72s)]
*  the verdict. Everybody wants to be first to it. You know, you saw people as [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1150.24s)]
*  soon as it was announced, kind of jump out of their chairs and run out of the [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1153.84s)]
*  room to go stream and be the first to report this news. So and you know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1156.76s)]
*  obviously right now we can see Diddy supporters cheering, yelling, wearing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1161.1200000000001s)]
*  their T-shirts saying a free go is not a Rico, which they've been kind of [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1165.28s)]
*  hawking on the streets for the last few days. And just to to refer to that, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1168.24s)]
*  Rico is the racking conspiracy charge. And when they say Rico is not a free [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1171.68s)]
*  go, what they're saying is essentially that is his private business, right? [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1176.72s)]
*  Is that's that's the point that they're making. Exactly. That's the argument [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1180.76s)]
*  that com supporters, his attorneys have maintained the whole time that the [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1183.5600000000002s)]
*  government shouldn't be coming into your bedrooms. And that's essentially [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1187.0s)]
*  what they were trying to do in charging coms on his sex life. And with Sean [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1190.0400000000002s)]
*  Diddy Combs, I mean, this is a man who's been part of the culture, hip hop [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1194.92s)]
*  culture for a long, long time. It's not like he'd retired. I think he was Grammy [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1199.48s)]
*  nominated just a week before he was arrested. But just what you were saying [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1202.12s)]
*  about content creators being hit. This guy is a big deal, right? In this [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1206.1599999999999s)]
*  country and globally. Yeah, absolutely. He's a huge deal. And I think we can see [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1210.76s)]
*  the impact of his celebrity on this trial. I mean, people are here that have [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1214.8s)]
*  grown up with his music. A lot of the content creators that I've spoken to [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  have said, you know, Sean Combs made the soundtrack to my childhood, you know, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1222.96s)]
*  people who are millennials or older. And they've kind of discovered that [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1227.0s)]
*  coming here and making one or two streams has skyrocketed their views [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1230.6s)]
*  and their followers. So obviously they have the incentive to come back and [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1234.12s)]
*  do it more. Inside the courtroom, just to sort of let people know, Cassandra [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1236.56s)]
*  Ventura, who was at the heart of the prosecution case, she wasn't inside [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1243.8s)]
*  the courtroom, but we believe her lawyer was. She was not in the courtroom [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1246.56s)]
*  today. But yes, her lawyer has been here for the past few days. He hasn't [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1249.6s)]
*  been here at all since Cassie's testimony, but he's come back. And in [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1252.8s)]
*  terms of what happens next, so we know that he just looking at it, he is [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1257.68s)]
*  facing a sentence of potentially up to 20 years in prison, but we're not [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1262.08s)]
*  going to get that today. No, today is just about the verdict and they're [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1265.96s)]
*  about to adjourn and let the jury go. Sentencing will be an entirely [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1269.96s)]
*  different affair on a different day. OK, and just to just to sum up that, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1273.56s)]
*  thank you so much, actually, as I mentioned, actually is one of our [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1278.08s)]
*  judges, she was a digital reporter, she was inside the courthouse, she's [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1280.64s)]
*  been covering the trial for the last seven weeks. This is the eighth [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1283.72s)]
*  week and we're in the final phase and we have received that verdict from [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1286.8400000000001s)]
*  the jury. Just to remind, he has been found not guilty in racketeering [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1291.2800000000002s)]
*  conspiracy. As we were hearing there, this was the more serious charge [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1296.1200000000001s)]
*  where he could have faced life in prison, but he has been found guilty [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1300.5600000000002s)]
*  on the transportation for prostitution, which refers to his ex- [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1303.96s)]
*  girlfriend, Cassandra Ventura, and a second woman who went by the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1308.12s)]
*  pseudonym Jane, and he could face potentially 20 years in prison, but, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1311.36s)]
*  as Sakshi was saying there, we're not at that stage yet of sentencing, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1315.1999999999998s)]
*  but we do have that verdict now in which this jury of eight men and [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1319.76s)]
*  four women have decided the fate of one of hip-hop's biggest stars. Yeah, [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1324.0s)]
*  and it has to be absolutely stressed just how huge this man is in terms [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1328.1999999999998s)]
*  of his music, in terms of his career. Nomiya, just one more to you, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1332.8s)]
*  because we're hearing from inside the court that the judge is now hearing [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1336.0s)]
*  from Sean Diddy-Coombs' legal team. His lawyer is asking for him to be [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1341.28s)]
*  released on bail, a $1 million bond, bail bond, so that he can be released [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1346.52s)]
*  from federal detention, because, of course, he has been behind bars since [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1353.64s)]
*  his arrest last September. We don't have sentencing just yet, but it's [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1357.6s)]
*  interesting that they will want to do what they can in terms of his legal [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1361.44s)]
*  team to get him from behind bars. They've tried this several times before, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  arguing that the charges he was facing were so serious, including, as we've [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1373.6000000000001s)]
*  been talking, racketeering and conspiracy, and he could have been [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1378.28s)]
*  sentenced to life in jail, and so their argument was that he should be [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1381.52s)]
*  allowed out on bail, and that was dismissed by the judge. We'll see what [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1385.56s)]
*  happens in regards to that. Let me just tell you what's happening inside [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1392.28s)]
*  court. So the defence, as just recapping, they want him released, they [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1398.2s)]
*  want him to return to his Miami home. His plane's been chartered, it's in [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1400.6799999999998s)]
*  Miami, he doesn't have access to his plane. They're saying this is his [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1405.8s)]
*  first conviction, he should therefore be released, his entire family is [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1409.32s)]
*  here. Any of them can sign on to a bond. So they're making that argument. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1413.28s)]
*  The judge is saying, has he relinquished his passport? The defence [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1418.8799999999999s)]
*  is saying, we'll give to pretrial services, we want him to be able to go [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1422.12s)]
*  to travel. He's got homes in Florida, LA and New York. The government [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1426.3999999999999s)]
*  opposes the application. So we'll see what happens there. But as I [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1430.2s)]
*  mentioned, they have done that before. His defence argued that he should [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1434.32s)]
*  be allowed on bail, and it's always been rejected. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGwxrcqLEAk&t=1437.36s)]
