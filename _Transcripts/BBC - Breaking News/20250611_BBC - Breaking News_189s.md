# Harvey Weinstein guilty of sexual assault after retrial in New York | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [June 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY)
*  Want to get more now from the U.S. That breaking news, Harvey Weinstein has been found guilty [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=0.0s)]
*  of one sex crime charge, not guilty on another, and no verdict on the rape charge. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=5.2s)]
*  Let's try and get a bit of clarity about what's going on. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=12.56s)]
*  We can speak to our North American correspondent, Neda Taufig. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=14.84s)]
*  Hi, Neda. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=17.32s)]
*  Just talk us through what's happened in court. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=18.32s)]
*  NEDA TAUFIG, North American correspondent, North American Times, New York, New York, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=20.2s)]
*  New York. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=22.2s)]
*  Yes, well, remember, this is the second trial of Harvey Weinstein in New York, after the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=23.2s)]
*  first one was overturned by a court of appeals that found that prosecutors had unfairly [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=28.68s)]
*  allowed women that weren't officially part of the charges to testify. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=35.7s)]
*  So on the second go-around, there was, of course, intense interest in how the jury would [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=40.32s)]
*  look at the evidence from two women, two of the same women who testified in the first [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=47.08s)]
*  But also a new third accuser in this second case. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=53.48s)]
*  Nevertheless, though, we have seen the jury deliberating over five days. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  And during those five days, there has been a lot of tension. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  In fact, there have been reports that the foreperson on the jury actually complained [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=68.52s)]
*  to the judge about some of the tactics being used by other jurors to try to change the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=73.4s)]
*  minds of others, bringing in some evidence, for example, that wasn't part of the case. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=79.24s)]
*  And Weinstein's attorneys actually tried to move for a mistrial, but the judge just reminded [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=85.11999999999999s)]
*  jurors that they had to look solely at the evidence in this case. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=91.0s)]
*  So after five days, we now have a decision where the jury has found Harvey Weinstein [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=95.63999999999999s)]
*  guilty of a criminal sexual act with one of the women, Mimi Haley. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=102.56s)]
*  Now, she was a production assistant that worked with Weinstein, and she has accused him of [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=108.36s)]
*  forcibly performing oral sex on her. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=114.64s)]
*  So they have found Weinstein guilty on that charge. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=117.44s)]
*  They have found Weinstein not guilty on the third new accuser, a Polish model who said [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=121.52s)]
*  that she was hoping that Weinstein would help her with his career, with her career, but [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=129.04s)]
*  then also forced oral sex on her. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=134.4s)]
*  Now, there is a third woman who was part of the original case, Jessica Mann. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=137.52s)]
*  She actually had a long consensual relationship with Weinstein, but accused him of rape. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=141.44s)]
*  Now, the jury is going to return tomorrow to continue deliberating on that count. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=148.12s)]
*  But look, we are years from the MeToo movement. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=152.72s)]
*  Harvey Weinstein, of course, was kind of the poster man for that movement because of how [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  many women in Hollywood had come out and spoken out against him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=162.08s)]
*  And so his initial trial where he was found guilty was really seen as a victory for that [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=166.24s)]
*  movement. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=171.44s)]
*  Years on, many were waiting to see what the result would be this time around. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=172.32s)]
*  So a partial victory for one of the women who the jury heard her case and believed her. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=176.8s)]
*  But more to come as we wait to see what the jury has to say about the rest of the case. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9L6PZRE7NqY&t=184.32s)]
