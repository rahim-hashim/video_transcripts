Video Description: Marine Le Pen has been banned from running for public office for five years, meaning she cannot run in the 2027 French presidential election.
 
She was found guilty of embezzling European funds to finance her National Rally (RN) party.
 
In addition to the ban from running for public office, she has been sentenced to four years' imprisonment, two of which will be suspended - though it is not known if she'll actually spend time in jail or if she will have restrictions, such as wearing an electronic tag.

# French far-right leader Marine Le Pen barred from running in 2027 presidential election | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw)
*  Hello, I'm Regine Vaidhinath and we come on air with some breaking news in the past few moments from France, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=0.0s)]
*  where the far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been banned from running for office after being found guilty of embezzlement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=7.36s)]
*  Well, you can see some images there, that's before she went in today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=16.4s)]
*  Now, this is consequential because, of course, France has a presidential election in 2027 and Marine Le Pen was seen as a leading candidate in that. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=21.6s)]
*  There's a lot of things we still don't know about how long that ban is for. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=34.72s)]
*  I think we now can go straight to our correspondent who's at the court, Hugh Schofield. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=39.52s)]
*  Hugh, just bring us up to date on what we've just heard on the sentence. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  We are in the middle of it now. It's very, very tense here. We don't know the total detail of the sentence against her. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=48.96s)]
*  We know that she's been found guilty, Marine Le Pen. We know that she will face a period of ineligibility, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=58.72s)]
*  but we still don't know, because I don't know, it hasn't filtered out from inside the court, how long that period of ineligibility will be, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=63.92s)]
*  and above all, whether it is applied with the French term execution provisoire, which means you're kicking straight away. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=70.56s)]
*  And happened regardless of any appeal. That's the two details we were waiting for now, this question of immediacy, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=78.0s)]
*  the automatic or non-automatic nature of this ineligibility. And within the next minutes, we should know. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  So we're very, very much on penta hooks here. It's crucial because if she's given a sentence of ineligibility, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=92.8s)]
*  but it can be suspended pending an appeal, then she's clear. I mean, she can run in the election. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=100.4s)]
*  The appeal might not happen for another year or two years, and it could certainly be pushed back. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=106.4s)]
*  So she would feel relieved in that case. But if this ineligibility is applied with this execution provisoire, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=111.52000000000001s)]
*  to use the French term, it means it happens now. And if it's for five years, then she's out of the race. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=119.12s)]
*  And that would mean the number one candidate, the most popular politician in France, is not able to run in the 2027 elections. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  You can see the stakes are very, very high here today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=133.52s)]
*  Indeed, Hugh. While we wait for more of that to come in, because I appreciate this is still ongoing with the sentence, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=137.20000000000002s)]
*  perhaps for viewers who don't follow French politics as closely as you and I do, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=142.4s)]
*  just put into context how significant Marine Le Pen is at the moment and has been for many years in the country. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=147.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, just to put it in context, Marine Le Pen is the head of the national rally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=155.12s)]
*  That's the far right, hard right, populist right party that's just gone from strength to strength [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=159.44s)]
*  under her leadership over the last 10 years. Regularly is seen to be, proved to be, in elections [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=165.76s)]
*  the biggest party in the country with the biggest number of voters. She's run twice to the presidency, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=171.6s)]
*  got through three times to the presidency, got through twice to the second round, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=177.36s)]
*  been beaten twice by Emmanuel Macron. She wants to run again. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=180.96s)]
*  And she believes that the tide of feeling in the country, in Europe, is moving in her favour. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  We have had Trump elected in America. We've had other hard right leaders elected, like a Maloney in Italy. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=190.08s)]
*  It's only a question of time for her that the hard right, her party, the populist right, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  representing the white working class broadly, comes to power. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=201.68s)]
*  So, and her supporters believe this is inevitable as well. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=208.0s)]
*  So if she's suddenly at this point, by a court decision banned from running in that election, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=213.04s)]
*  the reaction will be very, very strong from her supporters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=218.64000000000001s)]
*  I'm not predicting anything in particular, just saying that we will enter a period of great uncertainty. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=223.6s)]
*  Indeed, and she wasn't the only person to be involved in this particular case. There were other [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=228.96s)]
*  members of the European Parliament who were also convicted, is that correct? What more do we know about that? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=235.28s)]
*  Well, indeed, there are 25 people in the court beside me here who are all charged in one way or another [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=239.44s)]
*  with this system of illegal financing of their party, the National Rally. And basically, the way they did it, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=250.24s)]
*  not original, other parties have done it from other countries, and indeed France, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=257.92s)]
*  is to use money that comes from the European Parliament's funds, which are supposed to go to pay [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=261.84s)]
*  parliamentary assistants in Strasbourg and Brussels, to use that money not to pay for [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=267.6s)]
*  parliamentary assistants, but to pay for fully-fledged workers of the party, of the National Rally party [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=272.0s)]
*  based in Paris. So, for example, and the most sort of glaring example of this, which has been, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=278.08s)]
*  we can talk about as fact now because she's been convicted, was the bodyguard. Her bodyguard, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=283.84000000000003s)]
*  basically, was being paid with money that was supposed to go to a parliamentary assistant doing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=289.12s)]
*  parliamentary work in Europe. This was a glaring misuse of funds, of public money, our money, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=293.68s)]
*  taxpayers' money, according to the court, the judge in her rendition of the conviction. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=301.2s)]
*  And so it was inevitable that they would all be convicted. They have all been convicted. We're now [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=309.2s)]
*  waiting for the sentence with this key question, these two words, execution provisional, will she [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=314.16s)]
*  be prevented right now from running for public office or will it be something that can be suspended [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=321.68s)]
*  pending an appeal? And, Hugh, presumably she's still in the court where you are. Are we expecting to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=327.6s)]
*  hear from her at any point? Well, yes, totally. I mean, she's in there right now. From what I'm [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=333.04s)]
*  hearing from inside the court, she's highly attending every word from the judge. The judge [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=340.4s)]
*  has been spending a long time setting out the arguments for the judgment which is coming. She's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=345.84s)]
*  been setting out the case for and against this idea of an immediate ineligibility, presumably because [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=352.71999999999997s)]
*  she knows that there will be an appeal and it needs to be put on record the reasoning behind [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=361.91999999999996s)]
*  whatever decision it is that she takes. So Marie Le Pen is listening very hard to all of that, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=367.35999999999996s)]
*  surrounded by the other people who have been convicted now. And when the result comes, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=372.0s)]
*  when we know whether she's eligible or not to run in the next election, she'll emerge and we'll [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=378.08s)]
*  have that result. I need to say straight away that the national rally, her party, claims to have a [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=384.08s)]
*  plan B in all of this. If she can't run, there is her number two, effective number two, Jordan [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=390.08s)]
*  Bardella, the young 29-year-old who is officially party president, who's made a huge kind of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=395.44s)]
*  made huge waves for the party in a positive sense, in the sense that he attracts an awful lot of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=402.08s)]
*  young voters, regarded very favorably, seemed among party supporters as a very good catch, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=407.12s)]
*  a very good potential leader for the party. He would presumably step in in her place. But I think [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=412.88s)]
*  a lot of people are wondering whether actually if it came to Jordan Bardella running for the president [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=418.56s)]
*  instead of Marine Le Pen in 2027, whether he'd have quite the same appeal as Marine Le Pen, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=424.4s)]
*  who is this historic leader from the family, who has a kind of relationship almost of affection [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=430.32s)]
*  with tying her and supporters of the party. And of course you talk about her being hugely [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=436.24s)]
*  popular. She also has a lot of detractors. What are they likely to be saying today and what have [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=443.28s)]
*  they been saying as this case wraps up? Well, among her enemies there are those who are saying, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=448.56s)]
*  well, taking her side broadly, not on the question of guilt or not and whether that she should be [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=457.92s)]
*  punished, but they're saying if she can't run it would be a travesty and potentially very [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=463.36s)]
*  destabilizing for the country. There are others who are saying no, let her take the rap. This is in [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=468.64000000000004s)]
*  the law. It is in the punishment of ineligibility has been voted through parliament. It is the law. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=474.64000000000004s)]
*  Therefore why should she get any kind of special treatment just because she says she's going to be [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=480.96000000000004s)]
*  running in two years time? That's the arguments. There are certainly people who are saying that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=486.72s)]
*  it would be slightly undemocratic if you couldn't run because she has so many voters behind her. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=494.24s)]
*  I sense a buzz behind me. I'm just seeing... Something's happening. Leave it in court. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=499.44000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Hugh, we're just hearing because I know it's difficult. I've been in your shoes before [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=506.40000000000003s)]
*  when you're trying to talk to the world and also keep up with what's going on court, but we've just [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=510.48s)]
*  been hearing, Hugh, that that ban has come in from immediate effect. It is to immediate effect. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=514.96s)]
*  We don't know how long is the thing. If it's immediate effect, that's very, very significant, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=526.72s)]
*  but we now need to know for how long. If it's for five years, then she's out of the race. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=532.1600000000001s)]
*  If it's for one year, she could conceivably be a candidate in 2027 because that's two years away. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=537.0400000000001s)]
*  So, again, the devil is in the detail, I'm afraid. It's very hard for me to prognosticate on this [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=544.5600000000001s)]
*  until we have a definitive answer to those two questions. It sounds like... Yeah. I was [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=550.48s)]
*  just going to say, Hugh, while we wait for that... It looks like it's with immediate effect. While we [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=555.76s)]
*  wait for that, so we're hearing it is immediate effect, while we wait for that duration, one other [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=559.28s)]
*  thing to ask you is you've covered French politics for many years. How typical is a case like this? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=562.88s)]
*  Have you ever seen anything like this? This is very untypical. I've never seen anything like this, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=569.12s)]
*  where a court judgment, a judge can have such an impact on the holding of an election and on the [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=576.72s)]
*  democratic process. And that, of course, has been at the centre of all the arguments here, with people [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=587.12s)]
*  who support Marine Le Pen and who support her right to stand, which are two different things, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=592.24s)]
*  saying that it would be a dangerous democratic moment were a judge to be able to decide who runs [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=598.96s)]
*  and who doesn't run in the supreme election to choose who governs the country. But as I was [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=607.44s)]
*  saying, there are others who will be saying, well, no, what matters most in the country is [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=613.2s)]
*  that the law is upheld. And if this is the law and if this is the punishment that is [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=619.76s)]
*  encapsulated in the law and upheld by the law, then this is what should happen. So we've had all [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=624.8s)]
*  these arguments and the judge inside has just been giving her her rendition of the argumentation [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=631.04s)]
*  behind her verdict, but I'm afraid I still don't know precisely what that is. Other than that, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=637.04s)]
*  it is with immediate effect. We're hearing that she's actually left the courtroom and she left [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=642.4s)]
*  before her sentence was read out. So that could be while there was some movement behind you when [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=647.36s)]
*  you were speaking to us and we just saw some pictures. I've just seen some pictures in the [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=653.6s)]
*  corner of my eye which seem to show her having left the building now. So it looks like from what [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=659.28s)]
*  I'm seeing here that she wasn't actually present while that sentence was being read out. We can [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=666.08s)]
*  just show the scene outside. She's certainly has been present right up to this moment. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=671.44s)]
*  I do not know and I hesitate to conjecture what has led her to leave, whether it is nerves, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  whether it is her hearing the words, execution provisoire, in other words with immediate effect, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=684.96s)]
*  or whether she just wanted to get out, avoid the press, I don't know. But until we can say [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=690.08s)]
*  definitively that she's out of this race, it's hard to draw any firm conclusions about this [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=696.24s)]
*  judgment. All we can say is that they'll certainly be very disappointed in the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  national rally that there is this immediate effect to the ineligibility. But the key question still [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=706.16s)]
*  is for how long? Five years and she'll be out of the race. No question about it. Two years and [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=711.28s)]
*  she'll be out of the race because the campaign will start before that. But if it's one year or [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=716.24s)]
*  six months, then she could conceivably, well, she could definitely run in 2027. So I'm afraid [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=720.48s)]
*  we're still stuck here waiting to know the inner wording of the verdict. And everywhere around me, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=727.36s)]
*  I can see journalists and producers staring at their iPhones hoping that someone from inside the [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=733.92s)]
*  courtroom will tweet out the actual wording of the verdict. But it still seems to be a certain [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=739.8399999999999s)]
*  vagueness about it. Yeah. And how much is this gripping the nation? It doesn't make our life easy. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=748.0799999999999s)]
*  No, it doesn't indeed, Hugh. But it is an important story to stay on. Yeah, how much is this gripping [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=752.7199999999999s)]
*  the nation? It's totally gripping the nation today. Completely. I mean, maybe in the last weeks it [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=758.0s)]
*  hasn't been, but we had the trial back in November. We knew that the verdict had been [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=763.52s)]
*  deferred to today. So over the weekend and especially today, this is where the eyes of [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=767.52s)]
*  the nation are gripped because the implications are enormous. The implications are that this figure, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=772.56s)]
*  Marine Le Pen, on paper, according to polls, the most popular politician in the country, someone who [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=780.0799999999999s)]
*  has an extremely serious chance of winning the next presidential election, she may not be able [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=785.92s)]
*  to run in it because of a conviction for illegal party funding that goes back 10, 20 years. Now, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=790.56s)]
*  many people will say, well, so what? She was found guilty. She shouldn't be allowed to stand. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=797.8399999999999s)]
*  It won't be as simple as that, though, because people who support her in her party, people who [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=802.88s)]
*  are likely to vote for her party, will say, hang on a sec. Our country has a history of illegal party [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=806.8s)]
*  funding. Every party that we know of, from the Gaullist to the Socialist to the Communist, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=812.4799999999999s)]
*  they've all at some point or another played with the system in order to refill their depleted party [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=817.6s)]
*  coffers. Why should Marine Le Pen's national rally be treated any differently from them? So yes, [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=824.5600000000001s)]
*  let them pay a fine, but why should they be deprived of the right to run their own preferred [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=830.08s)]
*  candidate, the historic leader of the party and so on? That will be the reaction of many people [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=835.28s)]
*  who, you know, maybe the third of the country who regularly vote for her and her party, and they [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=841.2s)]
*  will not be happy at all if it turns out she can't run in 2027. So it is an extremely important [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=846.32s)]
*  moment in which everyone will be looking at today, and the fallout in the hours and days ahead will [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=853.12s)]
*  be very important. If she can't run, then we'll have to scrutinise what the party says. We'll [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=858.8000000000001s)]
*  have to scrutinise what her supporters across the country are saying. We'll have to scrutinise the [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=864.32s)]
*  survivability of the very weak government that there is now here in France under François Beyroux. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=870.08s)]
*  Up till now, Marine Le Pen has held fire. She does have it in her capacity with her big block of [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=875.36s)]
*  parliamentarians to join with the left to bring down Beyroux's government. She hasn't done that, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=881.44s)]
*  but if she's barred from running in 2027, she's not going to be in any kind of mood to hold out [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=886.24s)]
*  a hand of friendship to other politicians, certainly not those who are in government now. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=893.04s)]
*  So we could enter a very turbulent period in which the kind of hounds are unleashed by Marine [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=897.92s)]
*  Le Pen in parliament, and they decide to collude with the left in bringing down this government [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=903.68s)]
*  to François Beyroux. We'll just have to see. Some people are talking about, would there be [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=910.2399999999999s)]
*  protests and demonstrations if this happens, that she's barred from running. The party isn't really [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=915.28s)]
*  a party of street protests, so not like the left. It's not really part of their tradition, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=921.52s)]
*  so maybe not. But still, we're entering very turbulent times if she's barred from running in [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=927.1999999999999s)]
*  2027. OK, thank you so much, Hugh, for taking us through what we know so far. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iusr2Lm_giw&t=933.36s)]
