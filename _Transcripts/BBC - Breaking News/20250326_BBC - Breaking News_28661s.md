# LIVE: Myanmar Earthquake | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [March 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw)
*  I was still aware that it's this big of an earthquake. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=0.0s)]
*  So everybody was in a panic mode. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14.68s)]
*  And then I pick up the phone from editors and then I go straight because at that point [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17.0s)]
*  there were a lot of report about the skyscraper in Thailand, the Aja Chattu Chak area you [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21.56s)]
*  mentioned that collapsed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25.36s)]
*  We've seen circular of that video that is very horrific scene. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26.96s)]
*  So I really rushed to the scene and I am actually just like about 200 meters away from the site [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=31.48s)]
*  of the skyscraper that's collapsed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=38.28s)]
*  We can see the live pictures from the scene of where the skyscraper came down. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=41.32s)]
*  Just describe what is going on in that area at the moment, Panisha. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=47.56s)]
*  Yeah, so actually before joining this live, I talked to two of the survivor of the worker [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=52.959999999999994s)]
*  who worked one on the first floor of the scene of the skyscraper building scene and another [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  person on the fifth floor. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=64.16s)]
*  So at the moment we are now on the outskirt of the scene and a lot of workers still waiting. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=66.12s)]
*  There's a lot of very few people, a lot of police or a lot of the manager team to try [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=71.4s)]
*  to check on the number and check who is missing, which is really hard to identify because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  even though this project is a joint venture between two companies, but as there's also [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=82.44s)]
*  a lot of subcontractor, so they're trying to verify who has been missing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=87.64s)]
*  So that's still in that period. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=92.44s)]
*  So people and workers are still waiting outside just on the road, just similar to what happened [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=93.72s)]
*  inside the city centers where people coming out of the big building. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=99.0s)]
*  We are now sitting on just the road and weddings to see what will be happening next. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=102.36s)]
*  And on the two workers that I have talked with, one of them is 18 years old. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=109.39999999999999s)]
*  He just came here, came back from home and worked at the scene. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=114.24s)]
*  And he said that at the time he's in from the upstairs because that 30 story building, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=117.52s)]
*  there's crane like big equipment at the top of the building. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=123.32s)]
*  So he feel that his ground is shaking. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=127.52s)]
*  So he look up and he see, he saw that the crane is kind of shaking. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=130.7s)]
*  And at that moment, he said it was a split moment of like one minute that it just like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=134.68s)]
*  smoke everywhere and he couldn't see anything. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  So he just run for his life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=142.6s)]
*  So that's one guy for the 18 years old. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=144.42s)]
*  Another person, he 30, he part of one of the senior, one of this group, he working on the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=147.64s)]
*  fifth floor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  And he said as well that the moment he felt the shake, he said that he could feel and [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=154.24s)]
*  he was fearing for his life, he could feel that it's going to collapse. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=159.64s)]
*  And both of them said that they thought they would not survive. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=162.68s)]
*  But fortunately, they just ran as much as they can, as fast as they can and got out [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=165.68s)]
*  and just like sit and flop on the floor on the street, just next to the building. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=170.52s)]
*  We are seeing the dramatic pictures of what you've just been describing, that 30 story [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=175.08s)]
*  skyscraper that was under construction coming down, huge plumes of smoke. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  And then as you described those workers nearby, as you said, running for their lives away [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=188.38s)]
*  as from that building coming down, really dramatic pictures that we are seeing that [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=195.57999999999998s)]
*  were posted on social media of the exact moment that the 30 story building came down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=204.5s)]
*  And as we have said, at least 43 people are missing after this collapse. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=213.18s)]
*  Paneesha, just describe, you said you've never witnessed anything like this in terms of the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=218.46s)]
*  strength. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=224.5s)]
*  How often would you feel a tremor in Bangkok? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=225.5s)]
*  I've been born and raised in Thailand for like about 30 years, the number one in my [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  life that I feel the shake and my house on the ground floor. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=236.38000000000002s)]
*  So sometimes some Bangkok people on the higher floor on the skyscraper, they confuse a little [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=241.38s)]
*  bit things here and there when things happen. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=246.62s)]
*  But on the ground floor and at this level, never once in my life that I have seen it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=248.9s)]
*  And I've talked to worker, I've talked to witness along the way of coming to report [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=253.74s)]
*  this life. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=257.58s)]
*  Nobody has seen it happen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=258.58s)]
*  Nobody has seen this happen at this level. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=260.86s)]
*  The level that you stay on the ground, you feel the shakiness, you feel dizzy just standing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=263.06s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=269.06s)]
*  It's unprecedented, even in Thailand, in Bangkok in particular. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=270.18s)]
*  And do you know at the moment, we obviously can see the devastation that's been caused [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  to this building that was under construction. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=279.98s)]
*  Do we have any sense yet of what the scale of the damage is elsewhere in the city? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  So at the moment, we see this one big one does is that is have been reported to be to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=289.18s)]
*  be collapsed. We haven't seen another report of another building being collapsed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=295.26s)]
*  We have seen what you mentioned that on the big skyscraper, we seems like the infinity [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=299.62s)]
*  pool, the water is coming out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=304.38s)]
*  There are others construction area that people are fearing and literally shooting video online [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=306.78s)]
*  and posting it and fear for their life or not that construction is going to collapse [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=312.9s)]
*  or not. But at the moment, we have not seen any report. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=317.18s)]
*  And as you already mentioned that the Bangkok governor and also the prime minister, everybody [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=320.41999999999996s)]
*  has tried to pull all the string and try to just make sure that everybody stays safe. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=325.58s)]
*  And there also is a warning that within this time frame, still like another two hours that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=330.58s)]
*  they're still awaiting aftershocks. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=336.54s)]
*  So a lot of people still staying outside of the big building. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=338.7s)]
*  So we should hope that everybody kind of stays safe at this moment. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=343.62s)]
*  But no additional report apart from this actually two billion is the whole project is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=348.1s)]
*  two billion Thai baht, which is equivalent of over 60 million USD. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=353.98s)]
*  That's collapse. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=358.62s)]
*  And you mentioned that there is the fear, of course, of aftershocks. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=360.70000000000005s)]
*  And you've been talking to people as you got there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=366.22s)]
*  What have they been saying to you? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=368.74s)]
*  And as you said, a lot of them staying out of their buildings at the moment. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=370.82s)]
*  Has there been any official advice as to what to do? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=379.46s)]
*  So one of the officials is why is that the government have asked all the school to send [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=379.97999999999996s)]
*  and return the kids home and people, some of the people, some building, they do let [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=385.7s)]
*  people get inside. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=390.94s)]
*  But another buildings, quite a few other buildings still have people awaiting outside to see [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=392.21999999999997s)]
*  what to come next. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=396.78s)]
*  And everybody is still waiting for the announcement or the advice from the government or from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=397.82s)]
*  the authority of what they should be doing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=404.26s)]
*  But at the moment, we still seen Bangkok, central Bangkok, full of people just sitting [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=406.62s)]
*  on street from there to get back onto the building. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=411.21999999999997s)]
*  Yes, because I assume people are going to and the authorities are going to need to check [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=414.18s)]
*  the buildings to make sure they are safe. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=418.98s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=423.34s)]
*  And just for people who are just joining us, just describe again those initial moments, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=424.7s)]
*  because I assume that there wasn't any warning at all. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=431.5s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=437.38s)]
*  So the thing happened at around noon. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=438.1s)]
*  So people were just actually doing their lunch break. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=441.1s)]
*  Somebody already inside the building, somebody going outside and suddenly you just feel the [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=443.9s)]
*  shake. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=449.02s)]
*  It just come out of nowhere. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=449.78s)]
*  There's been since the morning until noon or 1pm. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=451.3s)]
*  There has been no warning, no SMS warning, sent no text to your phone or even no warning [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=454.9s)]
*  on Facebook page of the authorities. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=461.34s)]
*  No, nothing. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=463.7s)]
*  So people weren't aware that there's this that is big magnitude of earthquake happened [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  in Myanmar that could potentially affect Bangkok or Thailand. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=470.42s)]
*  So people were just doing their life. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  They're running their errand, they're doing their business as usual. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=476.06s)]
*  And suddenly you feel the shake. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=478.90000000000003s)]
*  If you were to stand on the ground, in my case, I was standing on the ground. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=481.1s)]
*  I literally have to just like sit down because I couldn't understand. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=485.02000000000004s)]
*  I couldn't process it. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=488.94s)]
*  It feel dissonant. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=489.94s)]
*  It feel like everything on the ground on your feet is shaking. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=491.22s)]
*  So this is on the ground floor. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=494.90000000000003s)]
*  So people who are actually living on the upper floor, it's been reported that the condominium, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=496.38s)]
*  the wall is cracked. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=501.86s)]
*  You could see that Miller is cracking. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=503.14000000000004s)]
*  So everybody is trying to run down on the floor. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=504.82s)]
*  And this has happened in the in the center. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=508.38s)]
*  This is not some things that Thai people or Bangkok people or people who live in Bangkok [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=511.86s)]
*  experienced before. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=516.94s)]
*  As we already mentioned, that this is so unprecedented. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=518.34s)]
*  We never seen something like this happen in Bangkok or in Thailand in particular before. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=521.54s)]
*  So it's very severe on top of that, using the circulation of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=526.5s)]
*  images of the big 30-story building collapsed within just like one to two minutes. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=531.5s)]
*  OK, Panisha, for the moment, thank you very much for your eyewitness report. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=539.14s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=543.94s)]
*  I know you're very close to the scene of that building collapse. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=545.94s)]
*  So I'm going to let you go to get more information about what's going on at the scene. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=548.62s)]
*  I can take you back to the live pictures from near where that building has collapsed. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=552.34s)]
*  You can see in the top left hand side of your screen, that is where the the rubble of the building is. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=557.5s)]
*  Now, we know that there are at least 43 people who are missing at the moment [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=565.5s)]
*  after that collapse. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=573.7s)]
*  And I want to show you some pictures and a warning. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=575.38s)]
*  They may be distressing to you of the moment of the collapse. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=579.7s)]
*  So this is that 30-story building that was under collapse. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=585.22s)]
*  And you can see the huge plume of smoke that is there as it comes down. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=590.42s)]
*  This is a close one. So there, the moment that that comes down and those people around it [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=597.66s)]
*  running and Panisha said she had spoken to one 18-year-old who was near the scene, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=604.6600000000001s)]
*  who described running for their lives. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=609.94s)]
*  And you can see those pictures just how it was so quick to come down. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=612.4200000000001s)]
*  And you can see the smoke that appears and then those people running [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  as quickly as they possibly can to get away from that area. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=627.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, we do understand that there were 50 people in the building at the time [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=632.18s)]
*  and seven of them managed to get out. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=637.62s)]
*  I want to take you back to the live pictures that are in Bangkok where the emergency services are there. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=640.9799999999999s)]
*  You can see that stretchers are being brought in by the officials there. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=647.78s)]
*  So there is obviously a huge emergency operation going on, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=653.9399999999999s)]
*  particularly around this building that has collapsed in Bangkok. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=658.5s)]
*  A state of emergency has been declared there. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=664.26s)]
*  The governor is in charge of the operation to help people. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=668.02s)]
*  You can see cars on the roads nearby to where that building has come down. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=673.78s)]
*  The building was intended offices. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=678.98s)]
*  So those the live images as that operation goes on in Bangkok. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=681.94s)]
*  I should again remind you if you are just joining us, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=688.0200000000001s)]
*  this earthquake wasn't in Thailand itself. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=690.98s)]
*  The epicentre was in neighbouring Myanmar, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=694.4200000000001s)]
*  which is about a thousand kilometres from the Thai capital. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=698.34s)]
*  It was near the Myanmar city of Mandalay and it was 7.7 in magnitude. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=703.5400000000001s)]
*  Let's get some more detail on the size of that earthquake. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=711.38s)]
*  Dr Brian Batti is a seismologist at the British Geological Survey. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=715.14s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=720.1s)]
*  We've seen these dramatic pictures out of Bangkok. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=722.5s)]
*  Just for our audience around the world, explain how big a 7.7 magnitude quake is. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=725.62s)]
*  This is a very large earthquake. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=732.5s)]
*  It's capable of causing extreme damage close to the epicentre [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=734.98s)]
*  and it's likely to have been felt further away. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=739.78s)]
*  The city of Mandalay, which is the second largest city in Myanmar [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=743.14s)]
*  and has a population of over a million, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=746.26s)]
*  was only about 17 kilometres away from the epicentre. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=748.42s)]
*  So it seems likely that there'll be significant damage and fatalities there. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=752.42s)]
*  Just to explain, we also heard that it was what's known as a shallow earthquake. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=757.86s)]
*  Explain what that is and the significance of that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=762.8199999999999s)]
*  So earthquakes occur at a range of depths throughout the Earth's crust and deeper. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=767.14s)]
*  But in this particular region of the Burmese Arc, if you like, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=772.42s)]
*  earthquakes are generally quite shallow. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=776.66s)]
*  We think that this earthquake occurred on a kind of major fault system [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=779.4599999999999s)]
*  that marks the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian or Tsunder plates [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=783.4599999999999s)]
*  and earthquakes that are typically at depths of less than 20 kilometres. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=789.2199999999999s)]
*  So you mentioned the plates. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=794.02s)]
*  Just explain how many are in that area [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=796.66s)]
*  and the basics of how an earthquake would happen with those plates. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=799.8599999999999s)]
*  So the outer shell of the Earth is made up of all these different segments [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=805.54s)]
*  and those segments are moving around. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=810.5799999999999s)]
*  Now they're moving pretty slowly, maybe a few centimetres a year, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=812.42s)]
*  but as they collide with and move past each other, that generates incredible forces. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=816.0999999999999s)]
*  And over time, those forces build up in the form of strain. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=821.14s)]
*  And eventually some of that strain needs to be accommodated [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=824.5s)]
*  either in the form of deformation or in the form of slip on earthquake faults. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=828.02s)]
*  And when the rocks on either side of those faults slide past each other, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=833.6199999999999s)]
*  and in a magnitude 7.7, we'd expect the kind of rupture to move several metres. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=837.38s)]
*  And that releases huge amounts of energy [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=842.5799999999999s)]
*  and that causes the shaking that people feel at the surface. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=844.5799999999999s)]
*  And we had the initial earthquake, but then a second one of 6.4, slightly after. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=848.58s)]
*  Is that classed as an aftershock or is it a separate earthquake? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=857.38s)]
*  That would be classed as an aftershock. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=862.6600000000001s)]
*  Large earthquakes, and in fact, most earthquakes are followed by aftershocks. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=864.6600000000001s)]
*  Those aftershocks occur because of the kind of change in stress in the Earth's crust. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=869.7800000000001s)]
*  So some of that stress is accommodated in the form of these additional earthquakes, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=874.66s)]
*  as stress is kind of transferred onto different parts of fault systems. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=878.66s)]
*  And I assume there is now a concern that there will be further aftershocks. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=884.1800000000001s)]
*  How likely would that be? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=888.82s)]
*  I think that aftershocks are almost certain. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=891.7s)]
*  For a magnitude 7.7, the rule of thumb is that the largest aftershocks are likely to be [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=894.66s)]
*  round about magnitude 6.7. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=900.34s)]
*  So that 6.4 that happened earlier this morning, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=902.4200000000001s)]
*  that's probably close to being the kind of largest magnitude of aftershock we would expect. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=905.14s)]
*  The aftershocks typically decay quite quickly with time after the main shock. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=910.1800000000001s)]
*  So the number will decrease rapidly after a few days or weeks. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=915.86s)]
*  But large earthquakes can still occur and those could still be a concern [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=920.58s)]
*  and could still cause damage, especially to buildings that are already badly damaged. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=924.98s)]
*  And just give us a sense of how prone Myanmar itself is to earthquakes. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=930.1s)]
*  How many have there been in the past and have they been as big as this one? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=935.46s)]
*  Yeah, so this is an area where the earthquake hazard is high [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=940.9000000000001s)]
*  and many large earthquakes have occurred in the region. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=944.58s)]
*  In the last 100 years or so, there have been 14 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6 or above, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=947.86s)]
*  within 200 kilometres of that centre of today's earthquake. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=954.34s)]
*  The largest of those had a magnitude of 7.6, so similar to today's earthquake, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=958.74s)]
*  but it occurred in 1946, a little bit further north in the Saigon region. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=963.62s)]
*  There was also a magnitude 6.8 in 1956 that was quite close to Mandalay. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=968.74s)]
*  That did cause quite significant damage, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=974.5s)]
*  but fortunately the number of casualties or the number of reported casualties anyway was quite small. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=976.82s)]
*  And this is always the situation when there's an earthquake. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=982.34s)]
*  We get the initial report from the US Geological Survey, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=985.54s)]
*  and I know that you in the UK would have monitoring as well. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=989.38s)]
*  It is always a bit later once we get to see the pictures [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=992.42s)]
*  and the authorities get there on the scale of an earthquake. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=996.42s)]
*  I think the impact of an earthquake always unfolds with time, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1001.62s)]
*  as more information becomes available. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1004.9s)]
*  At the moment, we expect it to be devastating. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1007.06s)]
*  There is likely to be very significant damage [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1011.2199999999999s)]
*  and the fact that there's a large exposed population living in vulnerable buildings [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1014.58s)]
*  close to where the shaking was strongest [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1019.38s)]
*  probably means there will be large numbers of fatalities. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1021.7s)]
*  And were you surprised by the fact that it has been felt so strongly [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1025.54s)]
*  a thousand kilometres away in the Thai capital? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1031.06s)]
*  I'm not surprised that it's felt. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1034.42s)]
*  I think that you might expect that, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1036.42s)]
*  but I am a bit surprised that it's caused the collapse of the building [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1038.74s)]
*  that's been seen in those media clips. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1043.62s)]
*  Yes, because modern buildings are, some of them, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1045.54s)]
*  we know that Thailand itself isn't particularly earthquake prone, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1049.78s)]
*  but there are, when buildings are constructed, [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1052.82s)]
*  people do think about things like that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1056.1s)]
*  I would expect any large tower block or any large building, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1058.9799999999998s)]
*  even in areas that maybe aren't so prone to earthquakes, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1062.9799999999998s)]
*  to have been designed with earthquakes in mind. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1066.9799999999998s)]
*  It seems that this building was actually under construction, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1070.6599999999999s)]
*  so I don't know what the exact situation was. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1073.22s)]
*  Similarly, I don't know exactly what the planning regulations are in Thailand. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1076.1000000000001s)]
*  Are you interested in the fact that it was felt very strongly in Thailand, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1080.18s)]
*  but we're getting less reports from Bangladesh, which is the other side? [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1085.54s)]
*  Yeah, that's possible because the earthquake occurred [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1091.22s)]
*  on this kind of major fault system that I mentioned, and it runs north-south. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1095.3s)]
*  So it's possible that the shaking was somewhat larger to the south [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1100.34s)]
*  than to the kind of west of the epicentre. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1104.42s)]
*  So that could be what's called a radiation effect. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1108.74s)]
*  Dr. Brian Bhatti from the British Geological Survey [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1112.66s)]
*  really appreciates you putting into perspective just how big this earthquake is. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1116.42s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time here on BBC News. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1120.18s)]
*  Thank you, you're welcome. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1122.58s)]
*  So getting a sense there of just how big this earthquake is, 7.7 magnitude. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1124.1000000000001s)]
*  My colleague, Julian McFarlane, is monitoring events. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1130.66s)]
*  We've heard the Red Cross saying that there is initial reports of significant damage in Myanmar, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1133.14s)]
*  and that would tie in with what Dr. Bhatti was saying about the strength of this in that area of Mandalay. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1139.8600000000001s)]
*  Right, we've also heard some updates from the Myanmar junta, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1147.22s)]
*  the ruling military leadership, who have now appealed for international aid. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1150.58s)]
*  Now it's very interesting because since that coup, that military coup, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1155.9399999999998s)]
*  that overthrew the democratically elected government in 2021, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1159.86s)]
*  Myanmar has been largely cut off from Southeast Asia. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1162.6599999999999s)]
*  It's heavily sanctioned. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1165.6999999999998s)]
*  It's been boycotted by ASEAN, which is the regional Southeast Asian League of Nations. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1167.78s)]
*  Interestingly, General Minh Anh Lang, who's the military ruler of Myanmar, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1174.74s)]
*  he was due to visit Bangkok next week. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1179.62s)]
*  It's rare for him to travel outside his many two main allies left, which are Russia and China. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1182.9799999999998s)]
*  But he's hoping to hold elections soon, and he's been trying to quell the civilian unrest, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1189.3799999999999s)]
*  those youth led protests that have been occurring in Myanmar since [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1195.62s)]
*  the democratically elected government were overthrown back in 2021. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1199.86s)]
*  And so how he manages to carry out any kind of rescue operation, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1205.46s)]
*  how he leads his country through this crisis, this will be very, very important for him. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1210.9s)]
*  Yeah, we should say we're seeing pictures from Bangkok because, of course, it is a lot harder [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1217.0600000000002s)]
*  to get live images out of Myanmar because of you talking about how the military control everything. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1223.22s)]
*  They control the radio, they control the television. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1228.18s)]
*  Also, we know that the internet has been down a bit. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1230.5800000000002s)]
*  Of course, BBC Team's been trying to make contact with people we know inside Myanmar, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1233.94s)]
*  but that has been hard. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1239.6200000000001s)]
*  These images coming from around the capital, which is Naypyidol, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1241.06s)]
*  which is around a thousand kilometres north of the capital. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1247.3s)]
*  And we can see that there has been some damage there. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1252.26s)]
*  And one of the hospitals there talking about how they are describing it as a mass casualty area. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1254.8200000000002s)]
*  We will start to see more pictures coming in from Myanmar. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1260.74s)]
*  There are a lot of civilian netizens who access the internet via VPN. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1263.3s)]
*  This is a colonial era bridge that was built by the British nearly 100 years ago. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1267.94s)]
*  And that collapsed earlier this morning. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1273.06s)]
*  We've had reports that several buildings in Mandalay, Naypyidol and other areas collapsed [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1277.78s)]
*  shortly after that earthquake took place. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1283.06s)]
*  There has been a lot of fast development and bad urban planning in Myanmar's cities, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1287.3s)]
*  which means that because of this, the crumbling infrastructure and the breakneck speed of them [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1293.06s)]
*  building means that there is a lot of fear that the buildings will not have fared well after this. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1298.98s)]
*  There have been earthquakes in Myanmar recently and they have occurred fairly often. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1306.82s)]
*  It's much closer to those tectonic plate boundaries that we heard from that seismologist [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1313.78s)]
*  who was talking to us earlier. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1318.82s)]
*  Far fewer earthquakes tend to happen in Thailand, which tends to see more natural disasters. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1320.98s)]
*  It's more prone to flooding and monsoons and typhoons. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1327.78s)]
*  And as our BBC Thai colleague was telling us earlier, there was a lot of panic in Bangkok [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1330.82s)]
*  because people in Thailand are just not quite so used to dealing with these kinds of earthquakes [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1335.94s)]
*  on a regular basis. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1342.18s)]
*  Yeah. And I think as she was describing to us, it was the fact that those images were on social media [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1343.06s)]
*  of the building that we can see collapsed here that suddenly spread. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1348.82s)]
*  And you can imagine you feel the quake in your own building. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1354.34s)]
*  You're trying to get out. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1358.74s)]
*  But then you look on social media and you see this 30-storey sky scraper that was being built, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1359.62s)]
*  this happening to it where it completely crumples in a matter of seconds. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1366.98s)]
*  And those people are, as one of them described, running for their lives. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1372.1s)]
*  You can imagine how panicked people would have been felt. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1376.98s)]
*  We should say that there were 50 people in this building. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1381.78s)]
*  And the authorities saying seven of them did manage to get out. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1385.8600000000001s)]
*  But at least 43 people are still missing after the collapse of this skyscraper in the centre [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1388.9s)]
*  of the Thai capital, Bangkok. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1397.38s)]
*  And we know, Julia, there is now a state of emergency has been declared there. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1399.6200000000001s)]
*  And the authorities are assessing what to do. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1405.14s)]
*  Right. I mean, there's going to be a huge clean-up operation. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1408.5800000000002s)]
*  And those extraordinary pictures of that building collapsed. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1410.9s)]
*  It was under construction that might perhaps account for its vulnerability. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1414.0200000000002s)]
*  But we are seeing a lot of footage coming in from Thailand of people experiencing quakes. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1420.0200000000002s)]
*  We've got pictures of roads buckling. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1425.3000000000002s)]
*  The emergency services, we've been watching them slowly gather outside the wreckage of that building. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1428.0200000000002s)]
*  We've started to see emergency service and rescue workers with ambulances and stretches [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1432.74s)]
*  being wheeled on to the scene and increasing numbers of heavy machinery and diggers. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1438.58s)]
*  Because, of course, this is a very complex operation they now have to undertake. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1443.54s)]
*  And they've got just a few hours left of daylight, which is going to severely hamper [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1446.42s)]
*  their rescue workers. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1452.74s)]
*  The fact that power lines have been affected, the fact that the internet is also going to be affected [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1454.5s)]
*  just because of the sheer number of people in Thailand who will be panicking. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1459.54s)]
*  They will be calling their family. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1462.74s)]
*  They'll be trying to coordinate. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1463.94s)]
*  And all of this is going to make rescue efforts much harder before night falls [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1465.3s)]
*  and things start to get much more serious. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1470.1s)]
*  And, of course, that will also apply in Myanmar, which is where the epicentre of the quake was. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1471.86s)]
*  We've managed to talk to some people. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1477.22s)]
*  So So Luin is in Yangon, which is Myanmar's largest city. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1479.62s)]
*  He described feeling the earthquake for, and I quote, a long time. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1486.26s)]
*  However, he did say there didn't appear to be widespread damage in the downtown area of the [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1491.8600000000001s)]
*  former capital. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1497.3s)]
*  But he did, as we've been reporting, add that residents are worried about the potential for [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1499.14s)]
*  another bigger earthquake in the coming days, or indeed those aftershocks. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1504.58s)]
*  And you mentioned that nightfall will come. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1510.02s)]
*  That is also when the temperatures will drop down as well. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1513.3s)]
*  And if people aren't inside their buildings, we see this often in the whenever there is an earthquake [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1517.54s)]
*  that people stay outside. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1525.78s)]
*  But then, of course, when it is night, they have the issue of staying warm when they don't want to [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1528.26s)]
*  get back into their building. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1534.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1536.82s)]
*  And I mean, people in Bangkok around the capital, around the building perimeter, the fear of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1537.3s)]
*  aftershocks and the fear of going back into that building will absolutely be playing on their minds. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1544.26s)]
*  But people will be wanting to know if their homes are safe, where they should be going. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1550.18s)]
*  The government right now is going to be prioritizing triage and trying to sort out which [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1555.38s)]
*  areas need power diverted, whether it's rescue workers, also police to keep civilians safe amid [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1559.8600000000001s)]
*  all of this chaos. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1566.18s)]
*  It's a huge task. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1568.18s)]
*  It's a huge operation. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1569.94s)]
*  And we're starting to see international offers for help. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1571.54s)]
*  Prime Minister Modi has said that he is offering assistance to Myanmar, responding to the Myanmar [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1577.7s)]
*  military leadership appeal for aid. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1587.38s)]
*  We've had the Red Cross announcing that they will be mobilized and that they will be [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1589.78s)]
*  in force soon. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1594.1000000000001s)]
*  But I mean, this is the kind of thing that requires a lot of international assistance. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1596.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1600.8200000000002s)]
*  And as we said, it is the military that are controlling the situation in Mandalay. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1601.14s)]
*  They've declared emergencies in six areas, and I know that military chiefs are on the way. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1604.9s)]
*  Julia, for the moment, thank you very much. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1610.0200000000002s)]
*  Julia will continue to monitor events. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1611.5400000000002s)]
*  If you are just joining us on BBC News, a reminder of our breaking news. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1614.0200000000002s)]
*  There has been a strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1618.42s)]
*  It has hit central Myanmar, the epicenter near the city of Mandalay in a city called [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1622.58s)]
*  Saghine. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1628.82s)]
*  It is an area about 100 kilometers north of the capital, Napier Dor. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1629.54s)]
*  The pictures that we are seeing live are from Bangkok because the quake was felt in the Thai [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1634.5s)]
*  capital, Bangkok, that a thousand kilometers away from the epicenter. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1642.02s)]
*  There is a building that was under construction, a 30-story building that has come down in the Thai [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1648.5s)]
*  capital. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1656.02s)]
*  These are the live images from there where you can see that the wreckage is there and emergency [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1656.5s)]
*  teams trying to work out what to do, some going into that area. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1662.74s)]
*  We understand that there are 43 people who are still missing. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1668.26s)]
*  Seven people did manage to get out of that building when it collapsed. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1673.46s)]
*  Buu Tu is a BBC journalist who lives in Bangkok. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1677.7s)]
*  She explained to my colleague Lauren her account of the moment that she felt the earthquake. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1682.02s)]
*  Hello, I'm in Bangkok and I was cooking when the initial earthquake hit my buildings. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1691.54s)]
*  I thought it was just I was having a vertigo, I was having a disease because it has been [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1700.42s)]
*  a decade. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1706.74s)]
*  I believe that Bangkok has not experienced any earthquake like that. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1707.22s)]
*  I was literally ignoring it in the first place. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1713.78s)]
*  Then when the second earthquake hit, it hit very hard. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1717.3s)]
*  I felt like I was shaking. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1721.54s)]
*  I could see all the stuff on the table was moving. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1723.54s)]
*  I was like, oh my gosh. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1728.5s)]
*  I was literally hearing my neighbors yelling. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1730.58s)]
*  I opened the doors and saw people running and I joined with them. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1734.1s)]
*  So we pulled out on the streets, literally with barefoot. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1738.7399999999998s)]
*  Then we saw some of the walls of the apartment cracking and we were very panicked. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1744.1s)]
*  We were calling our friends to check if they were okay. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1751.3s)]
*  We saw photos and videos on the internet when we checked if there was an earthquake. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1756.34s)]
*  There are a lot of buildings that we know. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1762.1799999999998s)]
*  For example, the Tricycle Check Market is a very famous tourism attraction. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1765.2199999999998s)]
*  There was a building there. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1772.6599999999999s)]
*  When we saw that, we were literally shocked. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1774.4199999999998s)]
*  We felt like, oh my gosh, why did this happen? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1777.86s)]
*  Then we really prayed for people in Maldali because it just a little hit in Bangkok. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1781.2199999999998s)]
*  We experienced kind of like terrific experience like that. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1787.06s)]
*  I cannot imagine what it would be in the epic center. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1791.62s)]
*  While we've been talking to you, we've heard from the first reaction from the [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1796.58s)]
*  military leadership in Myanmar saying that it's declared a state of emergency in six regions. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1800.98s)]
*  So that gives a sense of the scale of the issue in Myanmar. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1807.46s)]
*  Whilst we also have more pictures, as you two were saying, from Bangkok and a bit more [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1810.74s)]
*  information coming in from there. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1816.5s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about the reaction now from the authorities. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1819.62s)]
*  State of emergency in Bangkok. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1823.22s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about how they will implement that and what it will mean in practice. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1825.14s)]
*  The government is now monitoring the earthquake and the aftershocks of it. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1831.62s)]
*  Some ministries already deploy people to monitor some constructions. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1838.58s)]
*  And the buildings, we are hearing that about 43 people missing in the construction site. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1846.9s)]
*  They are hoping to rescue people. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1854.1s)]
*  We hope that they will not know any people died from this earthquake because it's really [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1858.42s)]
*  shocking and people didn't have any preparation for that as well. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1864.42s)]
*  The sky train system stopped, people were shaking. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1870.4199999999998s)]
*  It's all images and videos. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1876.74s)]
*  It's really terrifying for people that we are not prepared to. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1878.34s)]
*  This is what happened. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1883.3799999999999s)]
*  You mentioned the element of fear there. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1888.6599999999999s)]
*  Are people generally staying out of the buildings now? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1891.78s)]
*  Is that what they're doing? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1893.6999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1896.1s)]
*  After the earthquake happened, we all stayed out. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1897.1399999999999s)]
*  We had to stay there 30 minutes because you can imagine apartments and buildings [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1900.98s)]
*  have cracks on the walls. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1906.74s)]
*  It's not really safe. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1908.4199999999998s)]
*  It looks very safe to be back to the office or buildings or rooms. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1909.54s)]
*  Especially because it hasn't happened for decades. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1914.98s)]
*  The buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for the large earthquakes like this. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1920.34s)]
*  Structural damage could be very significant. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1926.1s)]
*  I just want to bring you a line of breaking news on this story. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1930.34s)]
*  The AFP news agency now quoting the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand saying that at least [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1937.86s)]
*  three people are now confirmed to have died in the building collapse that you heard being described [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1945.1399999999999s)]
*  by Bhutu, our colleague from BBC Thailand. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1952.5s)]
*  These are the live pictures from the scene of the collapse of this 30-storey building that was [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1954.98s)]
*  under construction in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1961.54s)]
*  The Deputy Prime Minister, according to the AFP news agency, saying that at least three people [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1964.98s)]
*  have been confirmed to be killed in this building collapse. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1970.5s)]
*  We knew from the authorities that seven people had managed to get out and that at the time 43 [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1974.42s)]
*  were still missing. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1980.9s)]
*  But in the last couple of moments, the Thai Deputy Prime Minister, according to the AFP [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1981.7800000000002s)]
*  news agency, saying three have died. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1988.5800000000002s)]
*  That the scene in Bangkok, but the actual epicentre was in Myanmar and very near to [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1992.3400000000001s)]
*  Mandalay. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=1999.46s)]
*  We've just got some pictures in from the airport in Mandalay. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2000.02s)]
*  I just want to listen to the sound on these pictures that we're now going to play you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2004.1000000000001s)]
*  So there you can see people crouched on the ground at Mandalay airport. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2010.9s)]
*  You can see one of the jets in the background, people down. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2021.5400000000002s)]
*  We know that voices in this video were heard to be saying sit down, don't run, and that [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2026.42s)]
*  people were screaming. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2032.74s)]
*  But obviously, this very close to the epicentre in Myanmar, about 18 kilometres from the [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2033.78s)]
*  city of Sageen, which is where the epicentre was. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2042.34s)]
*  But those pictures just into us from Mandalay airport. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2045.3799999999999s)]

*  now has led to three people dying in that collapsed building in Bangkok, in the Thai [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2069.46s)]
*  capital, the epicentre being a thousand kilometres away in Myanmar. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2075.7799999999997s)]
*  As I say, if you take our live page, it's got all of the latest details. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2080.66s)]
*  We are going to come back to the earthquake very shortly, but there is another big story [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2085.7799999999997s)]
*  that I just want to update you on and that is from Greenland because the US Vice President [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2090.8199999999997s)]
*  JD Vance is travelling to Greenland today where he'll receive a briefing on... [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2096.5s)]
*  A powerful earthquake has struck Myanmar. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2150.74s)]
*  The US Geological Service said it had a magnitude of 7.7. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2160.2599999999998s)]
*  The epicentre was near the city of Mandalay. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2164.74s)]
*  Initial reports suggested it caused significant damage. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2167.7799999999997s)]
*  Strong tremors from the same earthquake have been felt in Bangkok in neighbouring Thailand. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2171.2999999999997s)]
*  And joining us from Bangkok is Bui Tu, a resident in the city. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2177.22s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on Newsday. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2182.02s)]
*  Just tell us what happened where you are. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2184.1s)]
*  You're safe now. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2266.9799999999996s)]
*  We're thankful for that. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2284.4199999999996s)]
*  Just tell us what you saw around. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2285.8599999999997s)]
*  Do you mention the tremors, any damage, any people hurt where you are? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2288.2599999999998s)]
*  In my apartment, I just saw some cracking on the wall and water splashed out of the swimming [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2294.1s)]
*  pools and people just like yelling and they were like pouring all on the exit, you know, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2301.4599999999996s)]
*  exit floors. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2309.9399999999996s)]
*  So we're trying to, you know, grab our hat and what's going on. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2311.9399999999996s)]
*  So we just like standing on the street for a while and then we just like, you know, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2316.8999999999996s)]
*  on the street for a long time until we have another announcement, should we go back to [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2322.3399999999997s)]
*  our dream or not. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2326.98s)]
*  So it was literally the panic on the face of a lot of people because not only Thai people [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2328.58s)]
*  but foreigners haven't had this kind of like, you know, experiences as well. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2335.46s)]
*  So we were so, you know, panic. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2340.4199999999996s)]
*  Yes, I can imagine. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2345.06s)]
*  It's around 20 past two in the afternoon there in Thailand. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2346.74s)]
*  I imagine lots of people would have been at work, at school and as you were saying, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2352.18s)]
*  you were at home cooking. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2356.66s)]
*  Yeah, and I can sort of some friends calling me that they were stuck in on the Skytrain. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2360.02s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's a very, you know, big thing for a lot of people because, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2367.46s)]
*  like I said, we haven't experienced earthquake for a decade. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  So we didn't know that it's a real earthquake in the first place. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2378.66s)]
*  And a lot of people didn't know how to react to that. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2383.54s)]
*  So some of them still have to wrap their head around to the minute we decide to run [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2387.3799999999997s)]
*  on the street or find a place to hide. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2393.2999999999997s)]
*  So I hope that everyone is going to save. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2396.8999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, I can see that a lot of people that are in panic. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2399.54s)]
*  When I ran out of the room, I can see a lot of people that they don't know. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2403.54s)]
*  Should they go or should they stay at home inside the room? [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2407.94s)]
*  So I really hope that people are going to be safe. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2412.66s)]
*  And you mentioned the Skytrain, these elevated train transit systems high up in the sky there [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2416.9s)]
*  in Bangkok. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2425.78s)]
*  We understand that the government will be holding a special meeting as a result of the [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2427.14s)]
*  earthquake. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2433.38s)]
*  Has the government given you any special orders, directives on what you should do next? [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2434.26s)]
*  We haven't received anything yet. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2440.6600000000003s)]
*  But at that time, the Skytrain staff has announced to flee people. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2442.6600000000003s)]
*  So I think that they managed to control the situation. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2452.6600000000003s)]
*  But because this is a very, you know, unexpected experience for everyone. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2457.38s)]
*  So we were very panicked. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2464.5s)]
*  So I think that, you know, maybe there's going to be some chaos, of course. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2466.82s)]
*  But the situation seems under control now. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2472.34s)]
*  We too thank you for speaking to us despite. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2475.86s)]
*  Our main story, if you have just joined us here on BBC News, there has been a large 7.7 magnitude [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2482.98s)]
*  earthquake in Myanmar. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2489.6200000000003s)]
*  A state of emergency has been declared there. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2491.46s)]
*  The epicentre was near the city of Mandalay, which is about 100 kilometres from the capital [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2494.9s)]
*  Napier door. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2503.14s)]
*  The aftershock was also felt there. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2504.26s)]
*  And indeed, the shocks felt in neighbouring China and in particular in Thailand. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2507.78s)]
*  In particular, the capital Bangkok, where people were describing how there was a continuous [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2514.42s)]
*  shaking. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2522.66s)]
*  And I want to show you, and I should warn you, that these images are distressing. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2523.14s)]
*  It is the moment that a tower block that was under construction collapsed. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2528.42s)]
*  So there you can see those images of the moment. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2544.2599999999998s)]
*  The 30-storey building collapsed. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2549.06s)]
*  Now, this was a building that was under construction. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2552.2599999999998s)]
*  It was going to be government offices. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2556.98s)]
*  Now, the authorities said there were 50 people inside that building when it collapsed. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2559.06s)]
*  Seven of them managed to escape. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2565.3s)]
*  We were speaking to our correspondent who spoke to one of the people, an 18-year-old [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2567.7s)]
*  who said that he ran for his life away from that building. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2572.66s)]
*  We saw those pictures, just how dramatic they were. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2576.3399999999997s)]
*  Now, 43 people were missing. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2578.98s)]
*  And in the last few minutes, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand has said that at least [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2582.58s)]
*  three people have lost their lives. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2587.46s)]
*  I think we can take you back to the live pictures from the scene there in Bangkok, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2589.46s)]
*  where there is a rescue operation, a big rescue operation going on. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2595.7s)]
*  You can see that tents have been erected. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2601.22s)]
*  We saw some stretchers going in as well. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2602.8999999999996s)]
*  So 43 people, they said, were missing. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2606.58s)]
*  But the Deputy Prime Minister quoted on AFP news agency saying that at least three people [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2610.1s)]
*  have died and killed in this building collapse, a 30-storey building that was being constructed. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2617.7799999999997s)]
*  I should say that this is 1,000 kilometres away from the epicentre in Myanmar. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2626.66s)]
*  Now, communication networks there are down in many parts of the country. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2633.54s)]
*  The United States Geological Survey warning that the disaster is likely to be widespread [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2638.8199999999997s)]
*  and that there could be, this is according to the US Geological Survey, a quite large [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2645.7s)]
*  death toll. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2652.34s)]
*  As I said, we do not have much information. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2652.9s)]
*  The Red Cross saying they were struggling to get into Myanmar. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2655.38s)]
*  A major hospital in the capital, Napier Door, saying that some of the wounded are being [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2658.7400000000002s)]
*  treated outside. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2664.6600000000003s)]
*  Buckled roads making it difficult for the emergency services to respond. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2666.98s)]
*  An ongoing civil conflict. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2673.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course, you'll know that the military have controlled Myanmar since the coup will [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2674.9s)]
*  make it difficult to have a totally coordinated response to the quake. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2680.1800000000003s)]
*  We do know there is a state of emergency in Myanmar and also one in Bangkok with these [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2684.5s)]
*  live pictures that we are getting from the scene where that building that was being [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2689.38s)]
*  constructed came down and the Deputy Prime Minister saying at least three people have [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2694.26s)]
*  died. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2700.1800000000003s)]
*  Whenever there is an earthquake, a lot of video is posted on social media. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2700.6600000000003s)]
*  We saw that video of the moment that the building came down. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2706.82s)]
*  Important that we here at the BBC make sure that we verify all of the pictures before [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2712.5s)]
*  we show them. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2717.3s)]
*  So that is what our team is doing at the moment. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2718.02s)]
*  Jake Horton is part of the BBC Verify team and he's with me in the studio. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2720.58s)]
*  So Jake, it is difficult whenever there is a disaster. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2725.06s)]
*  There's a lot of video posted on social media. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2728.42s)]
*  You've been going through it. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2731.38s)]
*  Yes, everyone on the team at BBC Verify has been going through a slew of video that comes [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2732.42s)]
*  in to verify if it's genuine, if it's recent, if it's new and if it shows the earthquake [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2736.98s)]
*  in Myanmar. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2742.82s)]
*  And one of the biggest difficulties we found is that internet access in Myanmar is restricted [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2744.1s)]
*  since the military took over the country in 2021. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2750.34s)]
*  And also obviously there's service issues at the moment because there's been a major [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2753.14s)]
*  earthquake in the country. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2757.3s)]
*  We have managed to verify some videos out of Myanmar, including one we can play for [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2758.7400000000002s)]
*  you now, which shows the scene at Mandalay International Airport, which is about 18 [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2763.38s)]
*  kilometers from the epicenter of the earthquake. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2767.7000000000003s)]
*  And in the video you can see about a couple dozen people taking cover on the tarmac of [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2770.42s)]
*  that airport. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2776.02s)]
*  And you can also see in the video, you can see the triangular structures on the roof. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2777.1400000000003s)]
*  They're quite distinctive and we can pair those triangular structures you can see on [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2783.86s)]
*  the roof of that airport hangar to satellite images we have on Google Earth. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2788.5s)]
*  So that's how we confirm that that airport was taken at Mandalay Airport. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2795.3s)]
*  And we also do reverse image searches, which tell us how recent that video was. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2799.7s)]
*  And we can say that video was posted this morning. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2804.54s)]
*  There are no earlier versions of that video online that we can find. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2806.98s)]
*  So we can say where it is and how recent it was. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2810.06s)]
*  I find this fascinating you as a team. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2813.26s)]
*  You're saying literally because those buildings have the triangular bits at the top, that [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2815.78s)]
*  is how you can confirm that that is Mandalay. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2820.82s)]
*  Yes, they're quite distinctive. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2823.54s)]
*  You can see the colors and the patterns on the triangular formations on the top of that [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2824.78s)]
*  roof are quite distinctive. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2828.26s)]
*  And you can look at aerial pictures of Mandalay Airport on Google Earth, and they're quite [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2829.54s)]
*  easy to match up. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2833.6200000000003s)]
*  So yeah, that is how we verified that one. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2834.7000000000003s)]
*  And there's also been more footage out of Bangkok. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2838.46s)]
*  We've been reporting on the skyscraper that collapsed, the 30-story skyscraper that collapsed. [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2841.38s)]
*  And we managed to verify two pieces of video of that. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2845.7400000000002s)]
*  This is one from close up just below the building as it collapses. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2848.42s)]
*  And we also have another one which is further away. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2852.94s)]
*  And we managed to do that by looking at Google Street View in Bangkok. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2856.1400000000003s)]
*  And the building is in the northeast of the city. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2860.54s)]
*  And the exterior of the building on Google Street View matches the exterior of the building [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2863.58s)]
*  we see in this video. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2867.7000000000003s)]
*  So it's about 30 stories high, like you said. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2868.7000000000003s)]
*  It's under construction, but images on Google Street View at the end of last year match [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2870.7s)]
*  the exterior. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2875.14s)]
*  And we confirm it is where it is by doing that sort of work at BBC Verify. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2876.14s)]
*  And you also mentioned with the pictures from Mandalay, this reverse image search. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2880.18s)]
*  Just explain how that works. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2886.18s)]
*  Yeah, so it sounds more complicated and scientific than what it is basically. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2888.3799999999997s)]
*  Basically, you take screen grabs of videos and you put them through a search engine like [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2892.8199999999997s)]
*  Google or the other reverse image search engines. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2897.4199999999996s)]
*  And that will give you previous results of when that image was posted elsewhere online [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2900.02s)]
*  before. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2904.38s)]
*  And it's not 100% certain. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2905.38s)]
*  There might be times where certain results don't come up. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2907.22s)]
*  But for instance, in this case, we can see that no images matching that skyscraper or [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2909.82s)]
*  the similar images we saw at Mandalay Airport have appeared online before this morning. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2915.42s)]
*  So we can say with a good degree of certainty that they haven't been posted before. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2922.14s)]
*  So they're likely to be recent images of the incident. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2925.9s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2928.14s)]
*  We're seeing Mandalay Airport where people did get ducked to the ground. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2929.46s)]
*  Jake, thank you very much. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2933.2999999999997s)]
*  That's Jake Horton, who is from BBC Verify. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2934.62s)]
*  Jake, we'll continue to look at the images that are coming in. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2937.42s)]
*  Thank you very much indeed. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2940.2999999999997s)]
*  If you are just joining us, a reminder of our breaking news. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2942.02s)]
*  There has been a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, the epicenter about 16 kilometres [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2944.66s)]
*  from the town city of Mandalay. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2951.8199999999997s)]
*  However, the earthquake itself was felt in neighbouring countries. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2954.86s)]
*  We've had reports from China, but in particular in Thailand, where people living in Bangkok [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2959.26s)]
*  reported feeling the tremors. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2966.1800000000003s)]
*  And we have seen those pictures of a building that Jake was just showing us that has collapsed [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2968.94s)]
*  in the centre of Bangkok. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2975.1400000000003s)]
*  This was a 30-storey building that was under Khun City and it came down during this earthquake. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2976.78s)]
*  Now, seven people, we understand, did manage to escape. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2984.5s)]
*  The authorities saying that there were 50 people inside the building. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2989.02s)]
*  That meant that there were 43 people missing. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2993.38s)]
*  And this is the wreckage of that building that has come down. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=2997.5s)]
*  And the authorities saying in the last half an hour or so that three people have lost [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3002.42s)]
*  their lives there. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3009.1s)]
*  You can see the emergency workers in these live images coming in from Bangkok, where [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3010.18s)]
*  there is a big operation. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3014.9s)]
*  The authorities there have declared a state of emergency. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3016.7s)]
*  Let's go live to Bangkok. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3020.58s)]
*  And P.San Lekitprechal, who is there and was in an apartment on the 11th floor when the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3022.7s)]
*  earthquake struck. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3030.46s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3031.9s)]
*  I wondered if you could just describe to us what you felt and what happened when the earthquake [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3034.1s)]
*  struck. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3040.1s)]
*  Well, I was alone in the apartment with my dog and then suddenly I felt like dizzy. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3041.1s)]
*  So I thought maybe, yeah, something happening to my body. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3047.18s)]
*  And then I came actually out into the hall and then I saw the light hanging that was [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3051.3399999999997s)]
*  swaying quite big in a big way. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3058.7s)]
*  And then I realized that it was an earthquake. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3063.54s)]
*  So I sat down with my dog and then, yeah, and it was shaking for something like a minute, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3066.74s)]
*  which was quite scary because I have never experienced this in Bangkok before. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3074.8199999999997s)]
*  It's very unprecedented. [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3080.06s)]
*  And then after that, there was an aftershock about maybe 10 minutes later, which was smaller [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3082.74s)]
*  and didn't last as long. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3090.2599999999998s)]
*  So after that, it became calm. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3093.3s)]
*  But then I also heard a lot of sirens going nearby in the street. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3095.78s)]
*  And also I checked on the internet and because I live quite close to the Queen's Circuit [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3103.9s)]
*  National Convention Centre, where at the moment there is the national book fair going on with [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3111.94s)]
*  like tens of thousands of people inside. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3118.1000000000004s)]
*  So I saw a video that people are evacuating and then, you know, like pouring outside and [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3121.06s)]
*  also into the park, the big park nearby. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3127.9s)]
*  So it was quite, yeah, I was shaken. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3132.18s)]
*  But yeah, after the aftershock, nothing came anymore. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3137.42s)]
*  So I thought that the worst has passed. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3142.2999999999997s)]
*  But now that we are actually seeing the, you know, like the impact and the consequences [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3145.22s)]
*  of the earthquake, I'm very distressed by the loss of lives of the construction workers [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3150.06s)]
*  who are trapped under that collapsed building and also the images from Myanmar. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3157.2599999999998s)]
*  I hope that we will, the international community will quickly assemble support, search and [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3164.54s)]
*  rescue and humanitarian aid to our friends in Myanmar. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3174.2599999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3178.1s)]
*  You described how the shaking lasted for about a minute. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3179.1s)]
*  Were there other people in your apartment block and what were they saying when you got [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3183.82s)]
*  out onto the street? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3188.42s)]
*  Well, there were a lot of people who went out on the street and most people just, you [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3189.82s)]
*  know, were in a panic and didn't know what was going on because, as I said, it's quite [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3196.3s)]
*  unprecedented. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3200.58s)]
*  And then, yeah, we were waiting outside and yeah, nothing came further. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3203.22s)]
*  So many of us came back into the building but still remained vigilant. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3208.1s)]
*  I came back and then I started to, you know, like putting things in my emergency bag. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3212.4599999999996s)]
*  So I, well, of course, still vigilant and, you know, hopefully we will see through this. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3218.8199999999997s)]
*  Hopefully there will be no more aftershocks. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3226.3799999999997s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3229.22s)]
*  Thailand isn't used to big earthquakes, is it? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3231.22s)]
*  You said you've never felt anything like that. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3234.62s)]
*  How long have you lived in Thailand? [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3237.1s)]
*  Well, I have lived in Thailand most of my life and in Bangkok for the last 10, 15 years. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3239.02s)]
*  But I guess there have been smaller ones but never like this. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3246.46s)]
*  I think, like, I have also lived in Japan, Philippines and Costa Rica and have experienced [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3252.2599999999998s)]
*  some earthquakes before but this is like the strongest that I have had, I have felt. [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3257.82s)]
*  And was there amongst the people that you came out with a sense of panic or were you [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3263.9s)]
*  quite calm once you got outside? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3269.7000000000003s)]
*  I think, yeah, there's also a sense of panic. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3272.7400000000002s)]
*  People try to reach out to their loved ones on mobile phone, on, you know, like messaging [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3276.38s)]
*  apps and like Line or WhatsApp. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3282.86s)]
*  But, yeah, it didn't go through a lot of time. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3286.94s)]
*  So, like, people are really concerned. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3290.26s)]
*  And also because I, in the beginning, we didn't really know what is going on, like how much [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3292.54s)]
*  damage has been caused or, yeah. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3300.6200000000003s)]
*  So and also there's also, I think, at the moment, a lot of traffic jam outside because [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3305.86s)]
*  there are some roadblocks due to some fallen objects onto the tollway entrance and also [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3311.74s)]
*  some damages to the infrastructure. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3323.02s)]
*  So I think, yeah, traffic will be difficult. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3325.4199999999996s)]
*  And also the public transport systems also have been suspended until further notice. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3328.5s)]
*  So yeah, a lot of people are stuck in the city. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3334.8599999999997s)]
*  So there have been calls for people to carpooling. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3338.86s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3342.94s)]
*  Paisan, thank you very much for joining us and describing what you witnessed in Bangkok. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3343.46s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3347.98s)]
*  I want to take you back to the live pictures of the scene there in Bangkok. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3349.58s)]
*  This is near where that construction building came down. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3355.54s)]
*  I've just seen on another feed that we were getting some dogs have just been taken into that area. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3360.42s)]
*  This is the scene much closer to that building. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3367.22s)]
*  You can see emergency officials there. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3370.3799999999997s)]
*  We know that it was a 30-story building that was under construction in the center of the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3373.22s)]
*  Thai capital, Bangkok. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3379.14s)]
*  There were, the authorities say, 50 people inside that building and that seven people [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3381.14s)]
*  managed to escape. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3386.8599999999997s)]
*  One of our other colleagues from BBC Thai, who's near to the scene, spoke to an 18-year-old [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3388.5s)]
*  who described running for their lives as that building collapsed. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3394.7799999999997s)]
*  We knew at the time that there was 43 people who are trapped and missing in the last half [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3399.3799999999997s)]
*  an hour or so. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3404.8999999999996s)]
*  The Deputy Prime Minister has said that at least three people have died. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3405.8999999999996s)]
*  That according to the AFP news organization, you can see that there are a huge amount of [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3411.02s)]
*  emergency vehicles there. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3417.2999999999997s)]
*  A state of emergency has been declared in the Thai capital. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3418.46s)]
*  And I should keep re-emphasizing that the Thai capital is a thousand kilometers away [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3423.82s)]
*  from the epicenter of this earthquake. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3430.98s)]
*  It's a 7.7 magnitude earthquake and it struck Myanmar. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3434.14s)]
*  The particular area that it struck was near the city of Mandalay. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3439.78s)]
*  It's actually a city called Sagan. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3445.3s)]
*  And the Red Cross say there are teams are attempting to get there, but they are reporting [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3447.34s)]
*  significant damage in Myanmar, but are facing, as you can imagine, challenges getting there, [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3454.78s)]
*  particularly due to a lack of power in the affected area. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3460.7400000000002s)]
*  The humanitarian organization, the Red Cross, obviously is one of the organizations that [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3464.5s)]
*  will always react to an earthquake. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3470.6600000000003s)]
*  They say that the electricity and network lines are down in the Mandalay and the Sagan [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3473.34s)]
*  areas that the epicenter, the Red Cross, is saying is continuing to gather information [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3478.46s)]
*  on the humanitarian needs as a result of the damage. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3483.6600000000003s)]
*  So this massive earthquake, it was what's known as a shallow earthquake, about 10 kilometers [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3487.7400000000002s)]
*  under the ground. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3492.34s)]
*  We're going to take a while to get all of the information out of Myanmar because the [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3494.46s)]
*  communication networks, as I was mentioning, are down. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3498.46s)]
*  We do have these images out of Thailand where we know that there has been this building [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3502.1s)]
*  collapse, a building that was under construction and three people have died. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3509.5s)]
*  And the authorities saying that seven people did manage to get out, but 43 missing. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3515.78s)]
*  We think that 43 does take into account the three that have died. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3523.38s)]
*  I want to play you some people who were in Thailand at the moment that the quake struck. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3527.78s)]
*  They've been describing what happened. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3535.9s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3538.42s)]
*  I was checking a message on my mobile phone. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3539.42s)]
*  I was in my Lazy Boy and all of a sudden it moved back and forth and then it toppled over [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3543.82s)]
*  and I hit my head on the table, but it didn't leave a mark and I didn't break the glass [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3550.98s)]
*  table either. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3556.66s)]
*  This is not the first time that the building has felt an earthquake. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3559.46s)]
*  In 2004 when the tsunami and the earthquake happened in Sumatra, the building shook immensely [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3565.74s)]
*  for almost 30 minutes and then it had cracks in the walls, but never like this before. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3574.02s)]
*  I was waiting for the bill and then suddenly I started feeling that the earth is shaking. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3583.34s)]
*  You know my first thought is that maybe somebody is not feeling it, just me, something is wrong [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3587.5400000000004s)]
*  with me, but everybody was looking around and right away they were all going outside [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3592.6600000000003s)]
*  because you could feel it's going to last for a while. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3597.5400000000004s)]
*  I have experienced earthquakes twice before in Myanmar, but that was only like one second [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3600.7000000000003s)]
*  of one big bang. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3605.98s)]
*  Here it went on for at least a minute. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3607.98s)]
*  That's scary. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3611.98s)]
*  So they're one of the eyewitnesses talking about how we had heard that the shaking went [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3614.22s)]
*  on in Bangkok for about a minute. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3618.9s)]
*  Let's go to Tom Beeston who lives and works in Bangkok and joins us now. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3620.94s)]
*  Tom, thank you very much for your time here on BBC News. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3625.58s)]
*  Can you describe what happened to you when the quake struck? [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3628.14s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of the weirdest things I've ever lived for, to be honest. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3631.94s)]
*  We were on the 31st floor of our co-working building. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3635.26s)]
*  I was with a friend and he kind of looked at me funny and said, I think I've got vertigo. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3637.6600000000003s)]
*  Then suddenly everyone else around us started also looking at each other and then people [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3642.46s)]
*  thankfully were with us and people knew what they were doing. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3647.7000000000003s)]
*  They ducked straight under the desks and you have that moment where you don't really know [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3650.1000000000004s)]
*  what's happening. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3653.78s)]
*  Then it suddenly clicked. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3654.78s)]
*  So I, oh, this is an earthquake. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3655.78s)]
*  So yeah, we kind of got under our desk, ducked the cover and then there was that weird period [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3657.0200000000004s)]
*  where because we were so high up, we were like, are we better off sheltering here or [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3661.38s)]
*  should we kind of try and get downstairs as quickly as possible? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3664.82s)]
*  So then before we knew it, we were all rushing down the stairs as fast as we can with, you [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3667.46s)]
*  know, hundreds of other people around us. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3671.6600000000003s)]
*  And yeah, it was chaos. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3673.2200000000003s)]
*  How long did the tremor go on for? [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3676.02s)]
*  And you say you were on the 31st floor. [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3679.2200000000003s)]
*  What were the other people around you like on that floor? [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3681.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it was confusion and then a bit of panic and then just kind of trying [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3684.6200000000003s)]
*  to get yourself together to actually think about what to do. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3690.2200000000003s)]
*  But, you know, we could see the building really felt like it was shaking. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3693.94s)]
*  We could also see across from us swimming pools and other buildings were overflowing. [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3698.3399999999997s)]
*  So then when you realize that an earthquake is actually happening, it's OK, we need to [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3702.8199999999997s)]
*  get ourselves downstairs. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3706.62s)]
*  But it's very confusing, very panicky. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3708.62s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3711.8199999999997s)]
*  So you ended up on the street outside. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3713.22s)]
*  How many other people were there and what was their reaction? [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3715.5s)]
*  The other people there? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3719.54s)]
*  There was hundreds of hundreds of people. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3721.9s)]
*  The roads are all gridlocked as well. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3723.38s)]
*  And it's gone. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3724.98s)]
*  It was mainly people on phones trying to fool family, friends, kind of see what's going [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3725.98s)]
*  on, see if everything's OK. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3730.42s)]
*  And again, it's just you sometimes look at people and kind of laugh because you don't [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3732.02s)]
*  know what's just happened and what you've just been through. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  Look at other people. You just kind of have a disbelieved shock. [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3737.6600000000003s)]
*  And yeah. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3740.2200000000003s)]
*  And how long have you lived in Bangkok and have you ever witnessed anything like this before? [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3742.98s)]
*  I've been in Thailand for about 18 months now. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3750.26s)]
*  No. And it's one of those things where you never think it can happen to you. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3752.4599999999996s)]
*  And that's why at the start there was such a period of not knowing what was going on. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3756.62s)]
*  And I had a thought, oh, this is an earthquake. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3760.9399999999996s)]
*  Then a secondary thought of, no, it can't be, you know, that wouldn't happen here. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3763.66s)]
*  But then you bring out the six sets in. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3767.5s)]
*  And yes, the first time I've ever experienced something like this. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3769.8999999999996s)]
*  You mentioned the swimming pools. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3773.22s)]
*  Let me show our audience, if they're watching here on BBC News, exactly what you were [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3774.5s)]
*  talking about. So it's pools on the top of these [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3778.74s)]
*  very tall apartment buildings. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3781.98s)]
*  And the strength of the shaking meant that the water came over, Tom, almost like a waterfall. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3783.6600000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I thought one building had like a burst pipe or something, because from our angle, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3790.78s)]
*  it was just torrents and torrents of water coming outside. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3795.2200000000003s)]
*  What have the emergency services said? [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3799.3s)]
*  Have you had any messages about what you are supposed to do? [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3801.54s)]
*  Or was it a case of the people who were outside a bit of common sense going on? [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3804.7400000000002s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a long period of staying outside, not going back into buildings, things [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3809.14s)]
*  like that, because aftershocks are common. [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3813.74s)]
*  And for a long time after, I think we were sat outside the building for a good 90 minutes. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3815.8199999999997s)]
*  Just everyone just kind of sat there, not really sure when to move or what to do. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3819.8599999999997s)]
*  And we walked, we found we walked to go find like an outdoor area and there were closed [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3824.2599999999998s)]
*  businesses with the staff kind of sitting outside. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3828.5s)]
*  Everyone just kind of sat around talking. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3831.1s)]
*  And it's definitely like an air of uncertainty of kind of when to go back to normal and how [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3832.74s)]
*  long you kind of should wait in this kind of circumstance. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3836.7799999999997s)]
*  And you're obviously inside at the moment. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3839.7799999999997s)]
*  Have you gone back into the building or have you gone somewhere else? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3842.58s)]
*  We did. We waited about an hour to 90 minutes and we sprinted up the 31 flights of stairs [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3846.46s)]
*  to get our laptops. Not sure if that's the best judgment call. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3852.62s)]
*  I'm not saying we should have done that, but we didn't trust the lifts. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3855.54s)]
*  So we had a very sweaty run up to the 31st floor and a very quick sprint back downstairs [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3858.4199999999996s)]
*  just so we could get away from the city centre and get ourselves to an open area. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3862.54s)]
*  We're with our valuables concerned. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3866.58s)]
*  I assume that there might be aftershocks. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3868.66s)]
*  Yes, yeah, exactly. You know, you never know. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3871.54s)]
*  You do hear about it. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3873.3s)]
*  So. OK, Tom, thank you very much for your time. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3874.3s)]
*  Appreciate it. Glad you're safe after that experience on the 31st floor of that tower [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3877.86s)]
*  block. Appreciate your time. That's Tom Beeston, who works and lives in Bangkok. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3882.98s)]
*  Let's talk to another eyewitness. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3887.06s)]
*  This is Jonathan Hogan, who was on the eighth floor of his apartment block in Bangkok. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3888.54s)]
*  So not quite as high as the 31st floor, Jonathan, but just describe [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3893.22s)]
*  what happened to you when the earthquake hit. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3897.2999999999997s)]
*  To be honest, I've I grew up in California and Hawaii, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3901.7799999999997s)]
*  and I've kind of experienced earthquakes before. [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3905.22s)]
*  So it was kind of a deja vu feeling like I'd never experienced. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3908.2999999999997s)]
*  I've been in Thailand 12 years and never experienced anything like it. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3911.4199999999996s)]
*  And here and just kind of like, wow, I've I've felt this before. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3915.18s)]
*  And then the initial, I guess, shock of being in an earthquake kind of wore out. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3919.82s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is an earthquake. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3925.2200000000003s)]
*  So it was in the building I was in. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3926.7000000000003s)]
*  It it was it was pretty substantial. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3931.38s)]
*  I mean, it really did shake this place and it lasted. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3933.7000000000003s)]
*  I it felt like an eternity, but it probably lasted a good 30 seconds to a minute. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3937.26s)]
*  And it it was it was it was pretty scary, to be honest with you. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3941.82s)]
*  I haven't felt that in a long time. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3946.3s)]
*  I was going to say, if you if you've grown up in California, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3947.82s)]
*  of course, you are alert to earthquakes, [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3950.1400000000003s)]
*  but that not necessarily the case for people who live in Thailand. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3952.9s)]
*  No, I could instantly hear the screams from my neighbors. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3957.7000000000003s)]
*  Like the whole building just erupted in a frantic screaming, you know, [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3961.42s)]
*  and I was like, oh, OK, you know, me, I was kind of all right. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3965.5s)]
*  I've been through this before. No big deal. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3968.82s)]
*  I'm an old hat, so to speak. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3970.1800000000003s)]
*  And yeah, the ties are they're not used to this at all. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3971.7400000000002s)]
*  This was a very traumatic experience, to say the least for them. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3976.42s)]
*  And what was the mood amongst the other people when you got out on this on the streets? [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3980.94s)]
*  Um, I guess I'm a knucklehead because I just stayed in my room. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3986.62s)]
*  And then I had my fiance call me and said, [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3991.38s)]
*  there's going to be an aftershock. You need to get out. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3993.54s)]
*  You know, and I was like, OK, so I, you know, I grabbed my cash [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3995.5s)]
*  and I grabbed my passport and, you know, just some, you know, basic stuff. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=3999.66s)]
*  And I went downstairs and everybody. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4003.3s)]
*  I'm the ties are very happy people, you know, that's why one of the reasons [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4005.7s)]
*  I live here, the country is a great country to live in. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4009.2599999999998s)]
*  And I've never seen the look of shock and, you know, of just utter. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4011.62s)]
*  I mean, just there, the best way to describe it was shock. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4017.14s)]
*  I've never seen them with a blank expression. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4019.98s)]
*  They're always smiling. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4021.74s)]
*  They're always a very, you know, great culture here. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4022.7799999999997s)]
*  And I've just never seen them with that kind of blank, [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4025.98s)]
*  shocked expression on their face. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4029.62s)]
*  You know, they're scared. They're very scared, to be honest. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4031.46s)]
*  And what is the mood now? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4034.38s)]
*  We're a few hours now after the earthquake. [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4036.06s)]
*  Right now, it's it's still a kind of a panic situation [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4040.98s)]
*  because the my fiance works out at the airport and where she's at, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4045.02s)]
*  it's just sirens. [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4050.58s)]
*  I mean, I think out there got hit pretty hard. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4051.9s)]
*  I'm on more of the circumvent area, kind of the touristy area, [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4054.14s)]
*  I guess you could call it. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4056.94s)]
*  And she's more out by the business side of it. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4058.2200000000003s)]
*  I guess you call Don Meng. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4061.38s)]
*  It's the airport out there. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4063.06s)]
*  And she sent me a video and it's just pure like everybody sitting on the ground [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4064.58s)]
*  and all you hear sirens. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4068.98s)]
*  So, you know, that's that's not a good sign when you hear that, you know. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4071.1800000000003s)]
*  But yeah, the overall feeling still right now, I can look out. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4075.1400000000003s)]
*  And most of the people are still outside. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4078.46s)]
*  They're still they're still pretty scared, to be honest with you. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4080.42s)]
*  So you're the hard man inside while they're outside. [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4083.46s)]
*  I, you know, like I said, I've been through this before. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4086.86s)]
*  And, you know, the building I'm in, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4089.62s)]
*  I don't know if I'd be in the same situation, [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4092.3399999999997s)]
*  but I was in a 30 or 40 story building with, you know, like you just interviewed [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4093.98s)]
*  the last guy and those pools were rocking. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4096.94s)]
*  I just got out of the swimming pool at my gym, which is an infinity pool two hours ago. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4099.34s)]
*  And that would probably not been good for me. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4103.78s)]
*  I mean, after seeing some of those pools flashing over the edges, you know. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4105.78s)]
*  Yeah, I guess I dodged the bullet on that one. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4110.5s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much for describing your experience [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4114.82s)]
*  there live in Bangkok. Appreciate your time. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4118.38s)]
*  So no problem, folks. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4120.900000000001s)]
*  Thank you. As Jonathan said, there was the [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4122.66s)]
*  quake felt in the Thai capital, Bangkok. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4126.58s)]
*  But the epicenter is a thousand kilometers away in Myanmar. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4129.46s)]
*  And I want to show you it is difficult, as we've been mentioning, [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4133.9800000000005s)]
*  to get pictures out of Myanmar. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4136.9400000000005s)]
*  The communications are difficult. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4139.46s)]
*  And of course, the military do control Myanmar since the coup. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4141.3s)]
*  But I want to show you some pictures of a bridge that has collapsed, [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4146.06s)]
*  the Ava Bridge, where several spans have come down in the water. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4149.3s)]
*  And we are just getting a little bit more information from the Myanmar authorities. [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4154.900000000001s)]
*  State media and the military control a lot of the media [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4160.02s)]
*  in Myanmar, saying that several buildings have collapsed [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4164.38s)]
*  in five cities and towns due to the earthquake. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4168.26s)]
*  They are also saying that the earthquake caused the collapse of two bridges [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4173.339999999999s)]
*  and an expressway has been damaged. [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4178.66s)]
*  So this bridge is in Mandalay, which is very near [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4181.62s)]
*  the epicenter, which is a city called Sagan. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4186.62s)]
*  So Mandalay, about 16, 17 kilometers. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4190.7s)]
*  And that bridge has come down. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4194.7s)]
*  And the Myanmar state media is saying two bridges have come down. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4196.259999999999s)]
*  We also heard reports that there was widespread damage [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4200.38s)]
*  in and around areas of Myanmar. [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4204.7s)]
*  Let me show you again an area near Mandalay. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4206.9s)]
*  This is shortly after the quake. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4209.78s)]
*  There are cracks to the floors and the walls. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4211.78s)]
*  But in these pictures, it does seem that the buildings are mostly standing. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4214.86s)]
*  But the authorities are warning that people need to be aware [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4219.78s)]
*  of aftershocks within the next six hours. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4224.54s)]
*  There are six regions, including the area of the epicenter [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4228.06s)]
*  that are under a state of emergency. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4233.1s)]
*  Witnesses saying there are a lot of collapsed buildings, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4236.1s)]
*  including a hotel, a bridge, nursery schools and apartments in Mandalay [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4239.02s)]
*  and also Sagan, which is the epicenter of the quake. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4245.1s)]
*  The highway, as I mentioned, has also been damaged in some areas, [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4250.660000000001s)]
*  including bridges and state media saying that two bridges have come down. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4255.82s)]
*  You can see some of these dramatic still images from Mandalay [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4260.9s)]
*  backing up the fact that we are hearing from those eyewitnesses [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4264.38s)]
*  that there are a lot of collapsed buildings and damage to the roads, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4267.82s)]
*  as is always the case with an earthquake, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4272.66s)]
*  particularly in an area where communications is quite difficult. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4275.46s)]
*  You get the initial fact that an earthquake has happened. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4278.9s)]
*  This is only just over four hours ago that the earthquake happened. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4282.94s)]
*  And then you get some of the initial pictures here. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4286.86s)]
*  We can see damage to a road. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4288.82s)]
*  This is in the capital, Tapia Door. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4291.0599999999995s)]
*  That's about 100 kilometers away from the epicenter. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4293.299999999999s)]
*  But in that epicenter around Mandalay reports that there is collapsed [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4297.259999999999s)]
*  buildings, hotels, bridges, and there has been some damage [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4301.259999999999s)]
*  to the roads that you can see in those pictures that we have been showing you. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4305.78s)]
*  As I mentioned, it is a big earthquake. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4312.26s)]
*  It's seven point seven on in terms of the magnitude. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4314.22s)]
*  And Dr. Brian Batti is a seismologist at the British Geological Survey. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4318.5s)]
*  He explained how serious a quake of that magnitude is. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4323.74s)]
*  So this is a very large earthquake. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4328.66s)]
*  It's capable of causing extreme damage close to the epicenter. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4331.18s)]
*  And it's likely to have been felt further away. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4336.06s)]
*  The city of Mandalay, which is the second largest city in Myanmar [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4339.5s)]
*  and has a population of over a million, was only about 17 kilometers away [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4342.62s)]
*  from the epicenter. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4347.0199999999995s)]
*  So it seems likely that there'll be significant damage and fatalities there. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4348.7s)]
*  And just explain, we also heard that it was what's known as a shallow earthquake. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4354.0199999999995s)]
*  Explain what that is and the significance of that. [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4359.099999999999s)]
*  So earthquakes occur at a range of depths throughout the Earth's crust [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4363.7s)]
*  and deeper. But in this particular region of the Burmese [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4367.98s)]
*  Arc, if you like, earthquakes are generally quite shallow. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4371.98s)]
*  We think that this earthquake occurred on a kind of major fault system [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4376.0199999999995s)]
*  that marks the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4379.98s)]
*  or Tsunda plates and earthquakes that are typically at depths of less than 20 kilometers. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4384.459999999999s)]
*  So you you mentioned the plates. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4390.419999999999s)]
*  Just explain how many are in that area. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4393.0199999999995s)]
*  And the basics of how an earthquake would happen with those plates. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4396.18s)]
*  So the outer shell of the earth is made up of all these different segments. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4401.820000000001s)]
*  And those segments are moving around. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4406.900000000001s)]
*  Now, they're moving pretty slowly, maybe a few centimeters a year. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4408.820000000001s)]
*  But as they collide with and move past each other, that generates incredible forces. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4412.46s)]
*  And over time, those forces build up in the form of strain. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4417.46s)]
*  And eventually some of that strain needs to be accommodated [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4420.900000000001s)]
*  either in the form of deformation or in the form of slip on earthquake faults. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4424.34s)]
*  And when the rocks on either side of those faults slide past each other [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4429.9800000000005s)]
*  and in a magnitude seven point seven, we'd expect the kind of rupture to move [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4433.820000000001s)]
*  several meters. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4437.820000000001s)]
*  That releases huge amounts of energy. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4439.18s)]
*  And that causes the shaking that people feel at the surface. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4440.9400000000005s)]
*  And we had the initial earthquake, but then a second one of six point four [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4444.900000000001s)]
*  slightly after. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4452.34s)]
*  Is that classed as an aftershock or is it a separate earthquake? [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4453.7s)]
*  No, that would be classed as an aftershock. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4458.86s)]
*  Large earthquakes and in fact, most earthquakes are followed by aftershocks. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4461.0199999999995s)]
*  Those aftershocks occur because of the kind of change in stress in the Earth's crust. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4466.22s)]
*  So some of that stress is accommodated in the form of these additional earthquakes. [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4470.94s)]
*  A stress is kind of transferred onto the onto different parts of fault systems. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4475.0599999999995s)]
*  And I assume there is now a concern that there will be further aftershocks. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4480.14s)]
*  How likely would that be? [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4485.18s)]
*  I think that aftershocks are almost certain for magnitude seven point seven. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4488.02s)]
*  The rule of thumb is that the largest aftershocks likely to be round about magnitude six point seven. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4493.02s)]
*  So that six point four that happened earlier this morning, [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4498.7s)]
*  that's probably close to being the kind of largest magnitude of aftershock [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4501.5s)]
*  we would expect. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4505.38s)]
*  The aftershocks typically decay quite quickly with time after the after the main shock. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4506.62s)]
*  So the number will decrease rapidly after a few days or weeks. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4512.22s)]
*  But large earthquakes can still occur and those could still be a concern [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4516.900000000001s)]
*  and could still cause damage, especially to buildings that are already badly damaged. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4521.38s)]
*  And just give us a sense of how prone Myanmar itself is to earthquakes. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4526.42s)]
*  How many have there been in the past? [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4531.900000000001s)]
*  And have they been as big as this one? [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4533.54s)]
*  Yeah, so this is an area where the earthquake hazard is high [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4537.22s)]
*  and many large earthquakes have occurred in the region. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4540.9s)]
*  In the last 100 years or so, there have been 14 earthquakes [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4544.26s)]
*  with a magnitude of six or above within 200 kilometres of the epicentre of today's earthquake. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4548.42s)]
*  The largest of those had a magnitude of seven point six, so similar to today's earthquake. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4555.22s)]
*  But it occurred in 1946, a little bit further north in the Saigang region. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4560.0199999999995s)]
*  There was also a magnitude six point eight in 1956 that was quite close to Mandalay. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4565.099999999999s)]
*  That did cause quite significant damage. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4570.82s)]
*  But fortunately, the number of casualty was quite small. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4573.099999999999s)]
*  And this is always the situation when there's an earthquake. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4576.66s)]
*  We get the initial report from the US Geological Survey. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4579.86s)]
*  And I know that you in the UK would have monitoring as well. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4583.7s)]
*  It is always a bit later once we get to see the pictures [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4586.66s)]
*  and the authorities get there on the scale of an earthquake. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4590.74s)]
*  I think the impact of an earthquake always unfolds with time as more information becomes available. [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4595.9s)]
*  At the moment, we expect it to be devastating. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4601.42s)]
*  You know, there is likely to be very significant damage. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4604.74s)]
*  And the fact that there's a kind of large exposed population living in vulnerable buildings [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4608.82s)]
*  close to where the shaking was strongest probably means there will be large numbers of fatalities. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4613.66s)]
*  And were you surprised by the fact that it has been felt so strongly a thousand kilometres away in the Thai capital? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4619.78s)]
*  I'm not surprised that it's felt. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4628.820000000001s)]
*  I think that, you know, you might expect that. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4630.78s)]
*  But I am a bit surprised that it's caused the collapse of the building that's been seen in those media clips. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4633.02s)]
*  Yes, because modern buildings are some of them. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4639.9s)]
*  We know that Thailand itself isn't particularly earthquake prone, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4644.1s)]
*  but there are when buildings are constructed, people do think about things like that. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4647.18s)]
*  I would expect any large tower block or any large building, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4653.38s)]
*  even in areas that maybe aren't so prone to earthquakes, to have been designed with earthquakes in mind. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4657.34s)]
*  It seems that this building was actually under construction. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4665.06s)]
*  So I don't know what the exact situation was. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4667.54s)]
*  Similarly, I don't know exactly what the planning regulations are in Thailand. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4670.46s)]
*  Are you interested in the fact that it was felt very strongly in Thailand, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4674.5s)]
*  but we're getting less reports from Bangladesh, which is the other side? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4679.86s)]
*  Yeah, that's possible because the earthquake occurred on this kind of major fault system that I mentioned, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4685.58s)]
*  and it runs north south. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4692.82s)]
*  So it's possible that the shaking was somewhat larger to the south than to the kind of west of epicentre. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4694.74s)]
*  So that could be what's called a radiation effect. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4703.0599999999995s)]
*  That's Dr. Brian Bhatti, a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4707.099999999999s)]
*  just giving us a sense of the scale of that 7.7 magnitude quake. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4712.0599999999995s)]
*  As I said, the epicentre is in Myanmar, but as we've been reporting, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4717.34s)]
*  it has been felt in the Thai capital, Bangkok, in particular on a 30-storey building that has collapsed. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4722.46s)]
*  And I want to show you some pictures of the moment of the collapse and a warning. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4730.66s)]
*  They are quite distressing, but let me show you what happened in the Thai capital. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4735.06s)]
*  Hey, hey! [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4740.38s)]
*  So there, the moment that that 30-storey building that was being constructed came down, [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4750.78s)]
*  and you can see the people running away from the scene of that. [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4756.98s)]
*  Now, one of our colleagues from BBC Thai spoke to an 18-year-old who was very close there, [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4762.58s)]
*  who described how he was running for his life. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4768.42s)]
*  Now, the authorities say there were 50 people inside that building. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4771.38s)]
*  We know that seven of them managed to get out. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4775.78s)]
*  43 of them are missing or trapped. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4778.74s)]
*  But we have had in the last hour the Deputy Prime Minister saying that at least three people had been killed. [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4782.06s)]
*  These are the live pictures from the scene of that collapse, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4789.1s)]
*  where you can just see that mangled wreckage of concrete and the construction. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4792.94s)]
*  We saw a little earlier some dogs being taken into that area. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4798.86s)]
*  We've also seen some stretchers as well. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4803.42s)]
*  So an operation going on, of course, a disaster, a state of emergency declared in Bangkok. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4806.339999999999s)]
*  Let us talk to British tourist Ralph Leng, who is in Bangkok and experienced the earthquake when it struck and is outside at the moment. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4814.0199999999995s)]
*  Ralph, thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4822.18s)]
*  Just describe to us what you felt when the earthquake struck. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4824.42s)]
*  Yeah, I was in my apartment with my friend and then we just heard all of these weird noises, [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4829.14s)]
*  which now we realise was everything flattering. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4836.26s)]
*  Then a huge boom and we were just like, OK, we need to get outside. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4838.46s)]
*  Everyone was running outside. There's a lot of panic. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4842.9400000000005s)]
*  And then it was when we came outside, I fully understood what was happening, [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4845.26s)]
*  which was there was this pool here and all of the water was swishing around like a whirlpool. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4849.14s)]
*  And yeah, it was an earthquake and everyone was really confused. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4857.26s)]
*  And what is the situation at the moment? You've obviously not gone back inside the building. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4861.700000000001s)]
*  You're outside. What is going on around you at the moment? [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4865.3s)]
*  So I'm actually in a low rise building. So these ones are safe. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4868.740000000001s)]
*  I went onto the main road where there are the high rises and everyone is outside. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4872.58s)]
*  It is like fully gridlocked because a lot of people were trying to leave the city. [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4877.46s)]
*  A lot of the taller buildings sustain damage, kind of like cracks and stuff like that. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4882.66s)]
*  So no one kind of knows whether to go back inside. I live in a high rise building. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4889.1s)]
*  I'm not there now. I haven't gone home yet. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4893.18s)]
*  So I'm kind of still waiting on information. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4895.54s)]
*  And how long have you been in Bangkok? [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4898.9s)]
*  I've been here for two months now and it's not only new to me, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4903.3s)]
*  like my Thai friends who I was with at the time, like they haven't experienced anything like this before. [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4909.26s)]
*  This is it was crazy. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4914.1s)]
*  And what was the mood when you got out onto the streets? [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4915.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that was a bit of panic. I was worried for my friends in the high rise buildings. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4921.22s)]
*  I think also people were kind of asking themselves the what ifs, you know, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4926.62s)]
*  like this pool was a whirlpool. [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4930.74s)]
*  If you the majority of pools in Bangkok are on the roofs. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4933.62s)]
*  So if you were on a pool on a roof, then I know it'd been crazy. [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4936.9s)]
*  But those friends have kind of all come together now and sharing stories. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4941.86s)]
*  So I guess relief. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4947.74s)]
*  We're seeing pictures, as you described, of those infinity pools that are at the top of the skyscrapers [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4950.34s)]
*  and the shaking, meaning that the water has come down almost like a waterfall on the side of the buildings. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4956.34s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. I mean, if you can imagine that this pool here behind me, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4962.62s)]
*  which is on the floor, was all swirling around and it was half empty by the end of it, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4966.78s)]
*  I can't imagine what it would have been like on the 30th, 40th floor where the building is doing this. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4972.74s)]
*  Yeah, Ralph, just turn your camera around again and just show us that water. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4978.1s)]
*  So just describe you say that this the pool there, what all of the all of the water was was was shaking in that pool. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4981.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was like a whirlpool around here and all the water was coming out here and then it was kind of empty. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4989.86s)]
*  And a lot of like debris and stuff went inside. So they're having to drain it now. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=4995.26s)]
*  And yeah, that would have you had any messages from the authorities about what you should do? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5001.54s)]
*  Or has it been a case of you and your Thai friends just using common sense? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5007.02s)]
*  No, honestly, social media has been the way that we've been finding everything out. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5012.26s)]
*  Just like everyone was kind of on their phone just getting live updates of what was happening. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5017.620000000001s)]
*  The building collapse was all through kind of TikTok and Instagram. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5021.46s)]
*  We have had no information from the authorities. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5026.740000000001s)]
*  Yes, I would imagine we were talking to people earlier at the shock at seeing those pictures of that construct building [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5030.14s)]
*  that was under construction collapsing. [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5036.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that was crazy to see. [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5039.14s)]
*  I think I think no one knew the magnitude of it. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5043.06s)]
*  I think that that was the only one. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5046.66s)]
*  But in our heads, we didn't know what the center of the city looked like. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5048.38s)]
*  If all of the buildings were like that. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5051.42s)]
*  So everyone was calling their friends basically saying, are you OK? [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5054.42s)]
*  You know, and how do you feel now? [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5057.9400000000005s)]
*  I assume there is a worry that there could be aftershocks. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5060.18s)]
*  Well, my friends have gone out of the city and they've invited me out because they don't think that it's safe. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5064.98s)]
*  I haven't done that. I still haven't gotten back into my apartment, so I have none of my stuff. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5071.379999999999s)]
*  So I'm just kind of staying in this low rise building with my friends. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5077.0599999999995s)]
*  This, I guess, to see what's happening. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5081.459999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Ralph, we wish you the best of luck and fingers crossed there aren't any aftershocks. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5085.58s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us live on BBC News. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5091.0199999999995s)]
*  That's Ralph Leng, who is a tourist, as he was saying, staying in Bangkok, who witnessed the earthquake. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5093.18s)]
*  If you are just joining us on BBC News, a reminder of the breaking news, there has been a big, massive 7.7 magnitude quake in Myanmar. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5098.22s)]
*  The reason we are talking a lot about Thailand and Bangkok is because it was felt there. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5108.02s)]
*  This is a thousand kilometers away. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5112.860000000001s)]
*  And in particular, a building, a 30 story building that was under construction has collapsed. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5115.22s)]
*  These are live pictures from the area that we're seeing of the operation that is going on there. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5121.5s)]
*  Now, the authorities say there were 50 people inside this building at the time that it came down. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5126.62s)]
*  Seven people did manage to escape, but at least 43 are missing, with the authorities saying that there were three people who have been killed. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5131.98s)]
*  That coming from the deputy prime minister. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5143.26s)]
*  We're just hearing literally as I speak, we've had an update from the National Institute for Emergency Medicine in Thailand. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5147.0199999999995s)]
*  Sorry, those pictures have just disappeared. They are live pictures. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5154.179999999999s)]
*  And these are some of the other pictures we're getting in. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5157.139999999999s)]
*  We are now hearing that 70 construction workers are now missing at the site of the collapsed building. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5159.98s)]
*  This is according to the National Institute for Emergency Medicine in Thailand. [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5168.139999999999s)]
*  Now, we earlier reported at least 43 missing. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5171.94s)]
*  The authorities now saying 70 construction workers are missing. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5175.82s)]
*  A bit more information. We were saying that we're originally they were saying 50 people in the building. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5182.099999999999s)]
*  Now, in this post on Facebook, they are saying that there are around 320 workers on the site at the time of the collapse. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5186.94s)]
*  And currently 20 are trapped in lift shafts. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5196.5s)]
*  So if you've ever been to a building that's being constructed, they often have those temporary lifts that get the workers up and down in those buildings as they are constructed. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5202.34s)]
*  So we are hearing from the authorities that 20 people are trapped in the lifts. [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5214.82s)]
*  Now, we should say the number of deaths is unclear. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5220.02s)]
*  A field hospital has been set up at the scene as rescuers continue to look for survivors. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5223.22s)]
*  And we're seeing those pictures of that rescue operation that is ongoing there. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5229.18s)]
*  A little earlier, quotes from the deputy prime minister saying three people had been killed, but the total number is unclear in terms of the deaths. [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5234.1s)]
*  But that information just coming into us, this new information that is coming from the National Institute of Emergency Medicine in Thailand, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5244.58s)]
*  they now saying 70 construction workers are now missing at the site of the collapsed building. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5255.0199999999995s)]
*  They say that there were around 320 workers on the site at the time of the collapse and that 20 are trapped in the lift shafts. [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5262.74s)]
*  Again, reinforcing that the total number of deaths in this incident in Thailand, unclear at the moment. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5273.86s)]
*  But earlier, the deputy prime minister saying that three people had been killed. [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5282.7s)]
*  As you can imagine, a huge operation there going on to try and decide how to safely get into that wreckage of the building that is there. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5287.38s)]
*  But that information just coming into us that 70 construction workers are now missing. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5298.3s)]
*  Now, Panisha Amemotia is a reporter for BBC Thai. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5304.26s)]
*  She's just outside of Bangkok near where that building has come down and gave me an account of the moment the earthquake struck. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5307.38s)]
*  Yes. Hi. So when the earthquake happened, I was actually at home and was working, but then I start feeling like everybody else. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5315.14s)]
*  It starts to feel like disease. So I thought it was me. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5322.900000000001s)]
*  But then I heard the neighbors shouting and everybody just like get outside of the house. [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5326.06s)]
*  So I was as well. And at that point, I'm aware that, oh, there was some earthquake. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5330.34s)]
*  But at that point, I was still aware that is this big of an earthquake. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5334.9400000000005s)]
*  So everybody was in a panic mode. And then I pick up the phone from editors and then I go straight because at that point, there were a lot of report about the skyscraper in Thailand. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5339.38s)]
*  The area you mentioned that collapse, we seen circular of that video that is very horrific scene. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5349.34s)]
*  So I really rushed to the scene and I'm actually just like about 200 meters away from the site of the skyscraper that's collapsed. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5356.22s)]
*  We can see the live pictures from the scene of where the skyscraper came down. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5366.06s)]
*  Just describe what is going on in that area at the moment, Panisha. [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5372.1s)]
*  Yes, so actually, before joining this life, I talked to two of the survivor of the worker who worked one on the first floor of the scene of the skyscraper building scene and another person on the fifth floor. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5377.86s)]
*  So at the moment, we are now on the outskirt of the scene and a lot of workers still waiting. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5390.86s)]
*  There's a lot of very few people, a lot of police or a lot of the manager team to try to check on the number and check who is missing, which is really hard to identify. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5396.139999999999s)]
*  Because even though this project is a joint venture between two companies, but as there's also a lot of subcontractor, so they're trying to verify who has been missing. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5407.18s)]
*  So that's still in that period. So people and workers are still waiting outside just on the road, just similar to what happened inside the city centers where we were coming out of the big building. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5417.18s)]
*  We are now sitting on just the road and weddings to see what will be happening next. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5427.22s)]
*  And on the two workers that I have talked with, one of them is 18 years old. [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5434.14s)]
*  He just came here, came back from home and worked at the scene. [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5439.02s)]
*  And he said that at the time he he's in from the upstairs because that 30 story building, that's crane, like big equipment at the at the top of the building. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5442.3s)]
*  So he feel that he feel that his ground is shaking. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5452.3s)]
*  So he look up and he see he saw that the crane is kind of shaking. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5455.42s)]
*  And at that moment, he said it was a split moment of like one minute that it just like smoke everywhere and he couldn't see anything. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5459.34s)]
*  So he just run for his life. So that's one guy for the for the 18 years old. [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5467.42s)]
*  Another person, he 30, he part of one of the senior one of this group. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5472.38s)]
*  He working on the fifth floor. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5477.1s)]
*  And he said as well that the moment he felt the shake, he said that he could feel and he was fearing for his life. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5478.9400000000005s)]
*  He could feel that it's going to collapse. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5485.9s)]
*  And both of them said that they thought they would not survive. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5487.5s)]
*  But fortunately, they just ran as much as they can, as fast as they can and got out and just like sit and flop on the floor on the street, just next to the building. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5490.54s)]
*  That's Panisha Amoshi from BBC. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5501.0199999999995s)]
*  You spoke to us a little earlier with me in the studio monitoring events is Julia McFarlane, the UN saying that they're gathering information on the quake impact in Myanmar and the humanitarian needs. [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5503.179999999999s)]
*  We are getting a little bit more information now out of Myanmar. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5512.66s)]
*  What is the latest on the number of people we think may have lost their lives there? [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5515.5s)]
*  Right. So we've heard from a doctor in the Mandalay General Hospital who has said that the death toll is now at 20, with at least 300 people injured. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5519.26s)]
*  This doctor has said that there are more injured people still arriving, but they have a serious shortage of doctors and nurses and that they are almost out of cotton swabs. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5530.26s)]
*  So obviously, mass casualty event, as the Myanmar leadership said earlier today. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5539.62s)]
*  We know that bridges have come down, don't we? In Myanmar. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5547.86s)]
*  Exactly. There are bridges that two bridges that have collapsed. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5551.18s)]
*  There are now fears for large civilian infrastructure in Myanmar. [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5554.0599999999995s)]
*  We've had an update recently from the Red Cross who say that public infrastructure has been damaged, including roads, bridges and public buildings. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5558.86s)]
*  They say they currently have concern for large scale dams that people are watching to see the conditions of them. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5567.0199999999995s)]
*  This is an update from the Red Cross who are speaking to reporters via video link in Yangon. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5575.339999999999s)]
*  They expect the impact of this damage to be quite large. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5581.0599999999995s)]
*  Of course, if those dams were to be impacted by the quake, that, of course, the force of water rushing across civilian areas could be quite devastating. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5584.54s)]
*  So big concerns over that. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5593.339999999999s)]
*  And of course, we should say getting information out of Myanmar is quite difficult because since the coup, it is under military control there. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5594.62s)]
*  Right. So the Myanmar junta have been in power since they ousted the civilian democratically elected leadership back in 2021. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5601.5s)]
*  The government that was led by Aung San Suu Kyi, who's been in prison ever since, [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5609.46s)]
*  they have been dealing with youth led student protests and an insurgency in those years. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5614.62s)]
*  And part of how they have been trying to suppress those is by clamping down on the Internet. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5621.98s)]
*  They control most of the media. Access is very difficult for journalists. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5625.82s)]
*  But it is interesting that a team from AFP, Agence France-Presse, happened to be in Napier-d'or today. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5630.5s)]
*  They were visiting the National Museum in the capital when the earthquake struck. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5636.259999999999s)]
*  They have tried to access a large hospital in the capital. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5640.5s)]
*  But of course, doctors have asked them to stay outside because they are dealing with a huge influx of people. [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5645.419999999999s)]
*  The general leader, Min Aung Hlaing, he is now at that hospital meeting of the injured there. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5650.34s)]
*  I should say the pictures that we are showing are from Napier-d'or, where you can see some of that damage on the streets. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5654.46s)]
*  In a situation like this, the Red Cross trying to head there, but they are having trouble getting there. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5661.42s)]
*  This is going to be the issue now is getting the resources that are needed there, particularly as it will become night forcing. [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5666.14s)]
*  Absolutely. So they need power. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5671.9400000000005s)]
*  They are dealing with power outages, which they said earlier this morning are hampering their rescue efforts. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5674.06s)]
*  There is a need of mobilisation of rescue teams of large scale equipment needed in order to move debris, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5679.02s)]
*  to shift wounded people on appropriate transport ambulances. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5688.42s)]
*  We have heard that roads have buckled, that buildings have collapsed. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5694.34s)]
*  All of this is going to hamper rescue efforts in Myanmar. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5697.580000000001s)]
*  OK, for the moment, Julia, thank you very much indeed. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5700.22s)]
*  So it is a developing situation after that 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Myanmar, the epicentre near the city of Mandalay. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5703.14s)]
*  We have a live page up and running on the BBC News website and app. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5712.1s)]
*  You will see the QR code on the right hand side of your screen. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5715.860000000001s)]
*  You are with BBC News and our breaking news out of South East Asia this hour, where there has been a major earthquake. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5733.14s)]
*  The earthquake hit central Myanmar with strong tremors being felt in Thailand and southwest China. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5760.1s)]
*  Now the main quake hit at 0620 GMT, that's 12.50 local time, with a magnitude of 7.7. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5765.38s)]
*  The epicentre was close to Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5774.66s)]
*  Ten minutes later, an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.4 was recorded. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5779.54s)]
*  Now the full scale of the damage in Myanmar is still unclear. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5786.42s)]
*  Details are coming in. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5791.3s)]
*  The quake was strong enough to buckle roads around the capital, Napier Door, and a major hospital in the capital has declared a mass casualty area. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5793.3s)]
*  Some of the wounded are being treated outdoors. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5803.9400000000005s)]
*  The military authorities say there is a six areas are now under a state of emergency. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5807.14s)]
*  Close to the epicentre, several spans of this major river bridge which you can see on screen have collapsed. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5813.14s)]
*  This is near the epicentre, which is near the city of Mandalay. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5820.820000000001s)]
*  Now whenever there is an earthquake, a lot of video is posted on social media. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5825.780000000001s)]
*  We saw that video of the moment that the building came down, important that we hear at the BBC. [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5832.18s)]
*  Make sure we verify all of the pictures before we show them. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5840.18s)]
*  That is what our team is doing at the moment. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5843.46s)]
*  Jake Horton is part of the BBC Verify team and is with me in the studio. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5845.9400000000005s)]
*  Jake, it is difficult whenever there is a disaster. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5850.58s)]
*  There is a lot of video posted on social media. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5853.860000000001s)]
*  You've been going through it. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5856.820000000001s)]
*  Yes, everyone at the BBC Verify has been going through a slew of video that comes in to verify if it's genuine, if it's recent, if it's new, and if it shows the earthquake in Myanmar. [[01:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5857.860000000001s)]
*  One of the biggest difficulties we found is that internet access in Myanmar is restricted since the military took over the country in 2021. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5869.38s)]
*  Also, obviously, there are service issues at the moment because there has been a major earthquake in the country. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5878.42s)]
*  We have managed to verify some videos out of Myanmar, including one we can play for you now, which shows the scene at Mandalay International Airport, which is about 18 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5884.02s)]
*  In the video, you can see about a dozen people taking cover on the tarmac of that airport. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5895.86s)]
*  You can also see in the video, you can see the triangular structures on the roof. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5902.42s)]
*  They're quite distinctive. [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5909.219999999999s)]
*  We can pair those triangular structures you can see on the roof of that airport hangar to satellite images we have on Google Earth. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5910.58s)]
*  That's how we confirm that that airport was taken, a Mandalay Airport. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5920.42s)]
*  And we also do reverse image searches, which tell us how recent that video was. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5924.82s)]
*  And we can say that video was posted this morning. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5929.62s)]
*  There are no earlier versions of that video online that we can find. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5932.099999999999s)]
*  So we can say where it is and how recent it was. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5935.139999999999s)]
*  I find this fascinating you as a teammate. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5938.42s)]
*  And you're saying literally because those building top, that is how you can confirm that that is Mandalay. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5940.5s)]
*  Yes, they're quite distinctive. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5946.9s)]
*  You can see the colours and the patterns on the triangular formations on the top of that roof are quite distinctive. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5947.94s)]
*  And you can look at aerial pictures of Mandalay Airport on Google Earth, and they're quite easy to match up. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5952.74s)]
*  So, yeah, that is how we verified that one. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5957.94s)]
*  And there's also been more footage out of Bangkok. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5961.62s)]
*  You've been reporting on the skyscraper that collapsed, the 30-story skyscraper that collapsed. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5964.42s)]
*  And we managed to verify two pieces of video of that. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5968.82s)]
*  This is one from close up just below the building as it collapses. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5971.46s)]
*  And we also have another one which is further away. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5976.099999999999s)]
*  And we managed to do that by looking at Google Street View in Bangkok. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5979.14s)]
*  And the building is in the northeast of the city. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5983.38s)]
*  And the exterior of the building on Google Street View matches the exterior of the building we see in this video. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5986.660000000001s)]
*  So it's about 30 stories high, like you said. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5991.860000000001s)]
*  It's under construction. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5993.780000000001s)]
*  But images on Google Street View at the end of last year match the exterior. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5994.9800000000005s)]
*  And we confirm it is where it is by doing that sort of work at BBC Verify. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=5999.22s)]
*  And you also mentioned with the pictures from Mandalay this reverse image search. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6003.3s)]
*  Just explain how that works. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6009.22s)]
*  Yeah, so it sounds more complicated and scientific than what it is, basically. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6012.1s)]
*  Basically, you take screen grabs of videos and you put them through a search engine like Google or the other reverse image search engines. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6016.26s)]
*  And that will give you previous results of when that image was posted elsewhere online before. [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6023.06s)]
*  And it's not 100% certain. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6028.42s)]
*  There might be times where certain results don't come up. [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6030.26s)]
*  But for instance, in this case, we can see that no images matching that skyscraper or the similar images we saw at Mandalay Airport have appeared online in the last, you know, before this morning. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6032.9s)]
*  So we can say with a good degree of certainty that they haven't been posted before. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6045.299999999999s)]
*  So they're likely to be recent images of the incident. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6049.0599999999995s)]
*  Let's go to Bangkok and Pee Ksan Lekit Prechal, who is there and was in an apartment on the 11th floor when the earthquake struck. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6052.0199999999995s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6062.1s)]
*  I wondered if you could just describe to us what you felt and what happened when the earthquake struck. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6064.42s)]
*  Well, I was alone in an apartment with my dog and then suddenly I felt like dizzy. [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6072.18s)]
*  So I thought maybe, yeah, something happening to my body. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6077.42s)]
*  And then I came actually out into the hall and then I saw the light hanging that was swaying quite big in a big way. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6081.46s)]
*  And then I realized that it was an earthquake. [[01:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6093.62s)]
*  So I sat down with my dog and then, yeah, and it was shaking for something like a minute, which was quite scary because I have never experienced this in Bangkok before. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6096.9800000000005s)]
*  It's very unprecedented. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6110.26s)]
*  And then after that, there was an aftershock about maybe 10 minutes later, which was smaller and didn't last as long. [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6112.58s)]
*  So after that, it became calm. [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6123.46s)]
*  But then I also heard a lot of sirens going nearby in the street. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6125.9400000000005s)]
*  And also, I checked on the Internet and because I live quite close to the National Queen's Circuit National Convention Centre, where at the moment. [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6133.82s)]
*  Hello, I'm Nicky Schiller. Welcome to the program. [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6151.62s)]
*  I want to bring you straight up to date with our breaking news out of Southeast Asia, where a major earthquake has hit Myanmar and Thailand. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6153.98s)]
*  Now, the main quake struck at 0620 GMT, that's 1250 local time, with a magnitude of seven point seven. [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6162.1s)]
*  The epicentre was close to Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6171.1s)]
*  It was followed by a series of strong aftershocks. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6175.58s)]
*  The full extent of the destruction across the region is still emerging, but we can say that you may find them distressing because this is the moment that a large building came down. [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6178.46s)]
*  And I can show you those pictures now. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6191.3s)]
*  These are pictures from the area, so we don't actually have those pictures when it came down. [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6195.900000000001s)]
*  But this is the construction site in the Thai capital, Bangkok. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6201.5s)]
*  Dozens of people are missing after that 30 story high building collapsed. [[01:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6205.900000000001s)]
*  The city has declared a state of emergency. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6211.46s)]
*  And within the last few moments, the Thai deputy prime minister saying that 81 people are trapped after this building came down. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6215.54s)]
*  So 81 trapped. This is much higher than the number that we originally had. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6226.86s)]
*  So originally we had that there was 50 people who were inside the building. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6232.54s)]
*  That then increased to 70. [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6238.78s)]
*  We're now hearing that the Thai deputy prime minister saying that 81 people were trapped after that building collapsed. [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6241.26s)]
*  And we know that there were 320 workers on the site. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6250.780000000001s)]
*  This in Thailand, but the actual epicentre was in Myanmar. [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6254.7s)]
*  And this is some of the damage that is in the capital, Napier door, which is around 100 kilometers north of the actual destruction in the epicentre. [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6259.9s)]
*  You can see that the roads there have buckled a major hospital in the capital has declared a mass casualty event. [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6271.62s)]
*  Some of the wounded are being treated outdoors. [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6278.74s)]
*  Now, the ruling military junta has appealed for international aid. [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6282.299999999999s)]
*  I want to show you some pictures now from close to the epicentre. [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6286.98s)]
*  This is where there is a major river and a bridge has collapsed. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6290.379999999999s)]
*  And the authorities were saying that at least two bridges have collapsed and there is damage to the highways. [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6295.74s)]
*  Communication networks are down in many parts of the country. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6301.86s)]
*  But these the latest pictures, it is difficult to get pictures out of Myanmar because there is a difficulty in the communications there. [[01:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6307.219999999999s)]
*  And of course, all of the media is controlled by the military. [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6315.82s)]
*  But these some of the latest pictures from Myanmar itself, where a bridge has collapsed into a river near the epicentre, which is a city called Sagan. [[01:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6319.0199999999995s)]
*  This picture coming from Mandalay, which is about 16 kilometers from there. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6329.66s)]
*  So those in Myanmar. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6334.9s)]
*  Let me take you back to the live pictures from Bangkok in Thailand, where, as we mentioned, rescue workers are at the site of that building collapse. [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6336.94s)]
*  One person is now confirmed to have died. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6346.0199999999995s)]
*  As always in these situations, the number of casualties can change as more details come available. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6350.66s)]
*  But we know that 81 people, the Thai deputy prime minister saying in the last few minutes, are trapped. [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6360.34s)]
*  We were also hearing a little earlier that 21, sorry, 20 of the people who were trapped were in lift shafts. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6368.38s)]
*  As we were saying earlier, this building was under construction, a 30 story building under construction, and it came down. [[01:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6375.259999999999s)]
*  We've seen dramatic pictures of the moment that it came down, which we will show you a little later. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6382.7s)]
*  But this rescue operation underway at the moment. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6388.74s)]
*  Now, our colleague, Panisa Amotshi, is a reporter from BBC Thai, and she is very close to the scene of this collapse. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6392.94s)]
*  And she recounted the moment that the earthquake struck. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6403.26s)]
*  Yes. So when the earthquake happened, I was actually at home and was working. [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6408.22s)]
*  But then I start feeling like everybody else. [[01:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6413.900000000001s)]
*  It starts to feel like disease. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6416.02s)]
*  So I thought it was me. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6417.66s)]
*  But then I heard the neighbors shouting and everybody just like get outside of the house. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6419.14s)]
*  So I was as well. [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6423.42s)]
*  And at that point, I'm aware that, oh, there was some earthquake. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6424.5s)]
*  But at that point, I was still aware that it's this big of an earthquake. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6428.02s)]
*  So everybody was in a panic mode. [[01:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6432.5s)]
*  And then I pick up the phone from editors and then I go straight because at that point, there were a lot of report about the skyscraper in Thailand, the Aja Chouchak area you mentioned that collapse. [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6434.74s)]
*  We've seen circular of that video that is very horrific scene. [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6444.78s)]
*  So I really rushed to the scene and I am actually just like about 200 meters away from the site of the skyscraper that's collapsed. [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6449.34s)]
*  We can see the live pictures from the scene of where the skyscraper came down. [[01:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6459.14s)]
*  Just describe what is going on in that area at the moment, Panisha. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6465.18s)]
*  Yes, so actually, before joining this live, I talked to two of the survivors of the worker who worked one on the first floor of the scene of the skyscraper building scene and another person on the fifth floor. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6470.900000000001s)]
*  So at the moment, we are now on the outskirt of the scene and a lot of workers still waiting. [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6483.94s)]
*  There's a lot of very few people, a lot of police or a lot of the manager team to try to check on the number and check who is missing, which is really hard to identify. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6489.219999999999s)]
*  Because even though this project is a joint venture between two companies, but as there's also a lot of subcontractor, so they're trying to verify who has been missing. [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6500.219999999999s)]
*  So that's still in that period. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6510.46s)]
*  So people and workers are still waiting outside just on the road, just similar to what happened inside the city centers where people coming out of the big building. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6511.78s)]
*  We are now sitting on just the road and waiting to see what will be happening next. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6520.42s)]
*  What's happening next? [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6525.9800000000005s)]
*  And on the two workers that I have talked with, one of them is 18 years old. [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6527.34s)]
*  He just came here, came back from home and worked at the scene. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6532.22s)]
*  He said that at the time he's in from the upstairs because that 30 story building, there's crane, like big equipment at the top of the building. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6535.58s)]
*  So he feel that his ground is shaking. [[01:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6545.42s)]
*  So he look up and he see he saw that the crane is kind of shaking. [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6548.62s)]
*  And at that moment, he said it was a split moment of like one minute that it just like smoke everywhere and he couldn't see anything. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6552.5s)]
*  So he just run for his life. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6560.5s)]
*  So that's one guy for the for the 18 years old, an upper person. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6562.3s)]
*  He 30. He part of one of the senior one of this group. [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6566.5s)]
*  He working on the fifth floor. [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6570.22s)]
*  And he said as well that the moment he felt the shake, he said that he could feel and he was fearing for his life. [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6572.06s)]
*  He could feel that it's going to collapse. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6578.9400000000005s)]
*  And both of them said that they thought they would not survive. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6580.54s)]
*  But fortunately, they just ran as much as they can, as fast as they can and got out and just like sit and flop on the floor on the street, [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6583.58s)]
*  just next to the building. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6591.3s)]
*  Well, that a description of what happened. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6593.820000000001s)]
*  Let me take you back to the live pictures that we are getting from Bangkok. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6596.38s)]
*  And the news that we've had in the last few minutes from the deputy prime minister is that the rescuers currently trying to free 81 people that are still trapped in the rubble of that collapse building in the Thai capital, Bangkok. [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6600.9800000000005s)]
*  We understand that there were around 320 workers on the site at the time of the collapse and that around 20 of them are trapped in live shots. [[01:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6617.54s)]
*  Let me show you the dogs there. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6629.14s)]
*  We've seen the rescue dogs going in and out of that, because, of course, in a situation like this, often it is dogs that can manage to track down a scent of someone that might be trapped. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6631.06s)]
*  And that is what they will be using the emergency services, a big operation, a state of emergency declared across the whole of the Thai capital after this earthquake struck Myanmar. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6643.78s)]
*  And, of course, it being felt in Thailand there, you can see the destruction of that building. [[01:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6657.58s)]
*  Now, this building was one that was under construction. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6663.54s)]
*  It was a 30 story building. [[01:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6666.78s)]
*  It was going to be a government building. [[01:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6668.62s)]
*  And that is what has come down. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6670.54s)]
*  And I mentioned earlier and we saw them, there are some pictures and a warning. [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6672.26s)]
*  You may find them distressing, but we just want to give you a sense of the scale of the destruction and just how quickly it happened. [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6676.38s)]
*  So these are the pictures of the moment that this 30 story building came down. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6683.9800000000005s)]
*  Take a look at these. [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6690.34s)]
*  So there you can see how quickly that building came down. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6702.26s)]
*  And indeed, we were hearing from our colleague from BBC Thai how she spoke to an 18 year old who described running for their life from there. [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6711.3s)]
*  Let's take you back to the live pictures from Bangkok where that rescue operation is continuing. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6719.780000000001s)]
*  We know that there are 81 people that are currently trapped inside that collapsed building. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6726.46s)]
*  I should say that this is a thousand kilometers away from the actual epicenter of the earthquake, which happened in Myanmar. [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6734.26s)]
*  And we are getting some more details about what the scene is like in Myanmar. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6746.46s)]
*  This is coming from our colleagues at the BBC Burmese service in Yangon, a member of the rescue team based in Mandalay. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6752.06s)]
*  And Mandalay is very close to the epicenter, has told our colleagues at the BBC Burmese service that the damage is enormous. [[01:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6761.3s)]
*  That is what they are saying. They're also saying the number of deaths is also quite high. [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6770.22s)]
*  That's all we can say right now, because the rescue efforts are ongoing, they say. [[01:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6776.06s)]
*  The exact number of casualties is not yet known. [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6781.22s)]
*  But this rescuer who is in Mandalay and again, a reminder, this is about 16 kilometers from the epicenter of this 7.7 magnitude earthquake is saying that the damage is enormous. [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6784.42s)]
*  And the exact number of casualties not known, but it is at least in their hundreds. [[01:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6798.9400000000005s)]
*  We have spoken to a doctor at the Mandalay General Hospital who said that the number of people who died there was 20, with at least 300 more injured. [[01:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6803.86s)]
*  More injured people keep arriving at the Mandalay General Hospital. [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6815.219999999999s)]
*  And that is the hospital is very close to the epicenter. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6820.0199999999995s)]
*  So hundreds feared dead in Myanmar. [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6824.34s)]
*  A rescuer talking to the BBC Burmese service saying that there is enormous damage as we've been talking over the last couple of hours. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6828.14s)]
*  Getting communications in Myanmar is quite difficult. [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6836.62s)]
*  The power lines are down. The Red Cross were talking about how their operation is being hampered by the fact that they can't get through because of the power lines. [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6839.9800000000005s)]
*  Just also saying that the European Union saying that is ready to provide support to Myanmar after this earthquake. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6849.3s)]
*  We've also heard similar words from the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying that he can offer help if it is needed. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6858.1s)]
*  Often in these cases, it takes a while for us to understand the scale of what has happened in an earthquake. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6867.14s)]
*  But there you can see the emergency operation that's going in in Bangkok, where we've heard eyewitnesses talking about the shaking that they felt for about a minute. [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6874.74s)]
*  And the big focus is on that collapsed building, that 30 story building that was under construction. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6884.34s)]
*  The Thai Deputy Prime Minister saying that 81 people are trapped in that building at the moment and an operation that we can see there going on to try and rescue them. [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6892.38s)]
*  Let's talk earlier. I spoke to Paisan Lee Kitpre Chow. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6904.58s)]
*  Now he is in Bangkok. He was in his apartment on the 11th floor when the earthquake struck. [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6909.0199999999995s)]
*  Let's listen to how he described what happened when it struck. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6915.46s)]
*  Well, I was alone in an apartment with my dog and then suddenly I felt like dizzy. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6920.62s)]
*  So I thought maybe, yeah, something happening to my body. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6925.86s)]
*  Then I came actually out into the hall and then I saw the light hanging that was swaying quite big in a big way. [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6929.98s)]
*  And then I realized that it was an earthquake. So I sat down with my dog and then, yeah, and it was shaking for something like a minute, [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6942.0599999999995s)]
*  which was quite scary because I have never experienced this in Bangkok before. [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6953.54s)]
*  It's very unprecedented. And then after that, there was an aftershock about maybe 10 minutes later, which was smaller and didn't last as long. [[01:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6958.66s)]
*  So after that, it became calm. But then I also heard a lot of siren going nearby in the street. [[01:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6971.9s)]
*  And also I checked on the Internet and because I know the Queen's Circuit National Convention Center, [[01:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6982.26s)]
*  where at the moment there is the national book fair going on with like tens of thousands of people inside. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6990.22s)]
*  So I saw a video that people are evacuating and then, you know, like pouring outside and also into the park, the big park nearby. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=6997.780000000001s)]
*  So it was quite, yeah, I was shaken. But yeah, after the aftershock, nothing came anymore. [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7008.9s)]
*  So I thought that the worst has passed. But now that we are actually seeing the, you know, [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7018.98s)]
*  like the impact and the consequences of the earthquake, I am very distressed by the loss of lives of the construction workers that were trapped under that collapse. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7025.0199999999995s)]
*  Building and also the images from Myanmar. I hope that we will, the international community will quickly assemble support, search and rescue and humanitarian aid to our friends in Myanmar. [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7038.78s)]
*  Absolutely. You described how the shaking lasted for about a minute. [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7054.94s)]
*  Were there other people in your apartment block and what were they saying when you got out onto the street? [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7060.58s)]
*  Well, there were a lot of people who went out on the street and most people just, you know, in a panic and didn't know what was going on because, as I said, it's quite unprecedented. [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7067.82s)]
*  And then, yeah, we were waiting outside and yeah, nothing came further. So many of us came back into the building, but still remain vigilant. I came back and then I started to, you know, like putting things in my emergency bag. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7079.38s)]
*  So I, well, of course, I'm still vigilant and, you know, hopefully we will see through this. Hopefully there will be no more aftershocks. [[01:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7095.46s)]
*  But I guess there have been smaller ones, but never, never like this. I think, like I have also lived in Japan, Philippines and Costa Rica and have experienced some earthquakes before, but this is like the strongest that I have had, I have felt. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7105.86s)]
*  That was Paisan who was talking to us earlier, giving us a description of what happened when the quake struck on his 11th floor of his apartment. [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7123.5s)]
*  These are the live pictures that we're getting in from that huge operation that is going on very close to the site of that construction building that collapsed. [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7130.82s)]
*  It was a 30 story building that was being built and it came down during this earthquake. [[01:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7140.339999999999s)]
*  The Deputy Prime Minister telling us that 81 people are trapped in the rubble. [[01:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7146.46s)]
*  This is a close up, a live picture of that rubble. [[01:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7151.82s)]
*  There is just an enormous amount of mangled concrete and wires, as you would expect, in a building that has come down. [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7154.7s)]
*  And the additional issue is that it was being constructed, so not as strong as a building that would have already been built. [[01:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7163.9400000000005s)]
*  As we said, 81 people still trapped. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7172.66s)]
*  We were hearing earlier that at least 20 of them trapped in lifts inside. [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7175.42s)]
*  Of course, when a building is being constructed, often there are those temporary lifts that allow the workers to go up and down with the building materials that they will need. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7180.94s)]
*  But the authorities, we've seen them sending in dogs to try and find where these people are. [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7190.38s)]
*  But it is obviously a very delicate operation because the emergency workers who are going in don't want to put themselves in danger. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7197.14s)]
*  Because, of course, there are the possibility that some of that debris could come down. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7207.02s)]
*  We're seeing at the moment pieces of equipment and lights being sent to that area. [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7211.9400000000005s)]
*  Because, of course, the other thing that's going to happen is we will start getting nightfall where it will make this operation a little difficult. [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7216.54s)]
*  We've said it's a 7.7 magnitude earthquake. [[02:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7222.26s)]
*  Let's get a little bit more detail about where it struck and the details. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7225.14s)]
*  Our science reporter, Esme Stallard, is in the newsroom with more. [[02:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7228.46s)]
*  So, Esme, talk us through what we know has happened. [[02:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7232.34s)]
*  So there was this 7.7 earthquake. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7236.26s)]
*  What do we mean by that? [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7238.780000000001s)]
*  That's a measure of momentum. [[02:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7239.740000000001s)]
*  Effectively, it's a measure of how much movement there has been in the top layer of the earth and what size has moved. [[02:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7241.18s)]
*  So the earth's crust is split into lots of different plates and they're all moving constantly. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7247.42s)]
*  My my is that the confluence of four of these plates and so it's a very tectonically active region. [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7252.74s)]
*  So we had the main earthquake that occurred about 6.30 GMT around lunchtime local time. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7258.46s)]
*  And then there was a series of aftershocks which then occurred affecting the neighbouring countries. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7264.58s)]
*  But I want to talk a little bit more about that tectonic plate movement that I mentioned. [[02:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7270.099999999999s)]
*  I'm just going to show you this map here behind me, which is from the US Geological Survey. [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7274.46s)]
*  And the dot here highlighted in blue was that first initial earthquake that I mentioned. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7279.9s)]
*  But then what happens when you get that movement then settling is that you get then these aftershocks. [[02:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7285.5s)]
*  For example, there was another one here just south just 10 minutes later, which occurred. [[02:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7290.5s)]
*  Again, that was very significant. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7295.0199999999995s)]
*  It was more than six on that same scale. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7296.66s)]
*  Now, when I mentioned before those plates, what we can see here is we can see a major red line coming down close to where the earthquakes occurred. [[02:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7299.86s)]
*  That's a major fault line. [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7307.66s)]
*  So that's where some of that movement is happening. [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7309.3s)]
*  And the US Geological Survey says that the kind of conditions or characteristics of this earthquake suggest that maybe some of that movement was occurring along that fault line. [[02:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7311.66s)]
*  That's known as the Segei Fault and it's named after the area local to it. [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7321.46s)]
*  And then either side, you've got here the Indian Plate and then over here the Eurasian Plate. [[02:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7326.26s)]
*  And they're also moving. [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7330.58s)]
*  And so this is why this area is very prone to earthquakes. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7332.5s)]
*  But the sheer scale of it is quite unusual. [[02:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7335.74s)]
*  The reason that we think it was so significant is that this earthquake happened a very low area below the crust. [[02:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7338.66s)]
*  It was only 10 kilometres down. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7345.58s)]
*  It's a very shallow earthquake. [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7347.139999999999s)]
*  And that means when you get a lot of that movement between the plates, it really has a big effect on the surface. [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7349.22s)]
*  In terms of can we look at previous earthquakes? [[02:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7355.34s)]
*  Can they indicate potentially the scale? [[02:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7357.98s)]
*  When we look at other earthquakes of this size, we have seen significant fatalities. [[02:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7360.3s)]
*  And I think that is why it's such a concern for local authorities and rescue services at this time. [[02:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7365.06s)]
*  There's also, you know, mentioned just that the concern about further aftershocks. [[02:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7371.34s)]
*  So we've seen some more. [[02:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7375.26s)]
*  Those are the other orange dots here occurring. [[02:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7376.820000000001s)]
*  So there is still the risk at this time that there will be further earthquakes felt. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7378.900000000001s)]
*  But you can understand considering the kind of surrounding geology, why this occurred. [[02:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7383.54s)]
*  Esme, thank you very much for that detail. [[02:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7389.22s)]
*  Esme Stallard, who is our science reporter with detail of what we know about that 7.7 magnitude quake. [[02:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7391.3s)]
*  As she was saying, the epicentre is in Myanmar and it is difficult to get information and pictures out because we know that power lines are down. [[02:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7397.740000000001s)]
*  Communication is difficult and also the fact that it is under military control since the coup. [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7407.54s)]
*  I do want to show you some pictures that we've had in. [[02:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7413.62s)]
*  This is of a bridge that has collapsed. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7416.62s)]
*  Now, this is near Saigon, Serguine, which is where the actual earthquake was. [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7419.62s)]
*  It's near the city of Mandalay. [[02:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7428.82s)]
*  And you can see a bridge has come down. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7430.46s)]
*  We are just hearing from our colleagues at the BBC Burmese service that they know that power lines are down in Yangon and Mandalay. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7432.62s)]
*  And this some of the buildings, the damage that has happened in Mandalay. [[02:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7442.02s)]
*  A member of the rescue team telling BBC Burmese service that their damage is enormous and the number of deaths is also quite high. [[02:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7447.22s)]
*  But we don't have much information necessarily on the number of people. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7456.18s)]
*  I'm going to bring in Julia McFarland, who is with me here in the studio. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7461.06s)]
*  What is the latest we're getting from Myanmar in terms of the damage and how many people we think may be injured and have died? [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7465.34s)]
*  Right, Nikki. Well, we've had updates from two major hospitals in Myanmar, one in the capital, [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7473.9800000000005s)]
*  Napier and one in Mandalay, closer to the epicenter. [[02:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7478.38s)]
*  We have heard from a doctor in Mandalay General Hospital, which has declared a mass casualty event. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7481.34s)]
*  This doctor has told us that 20 people are believed to have died now. [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7488.66s)]
*  They believe that there are around 300 people injured. [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7493.22s)]
*  They are dealing with a huge influx of people arriving on foot on taxis. [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7496.42s)]
*  They are experiencing a dire shortage of nurses and doctors to help treat those injured people. [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7502.66s)]
*  This doctor has told us that they are also running out of cotton swabs. [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7510.18s)]
*  Meanwhile, over in the capital, Napier, it's quite rare that journalists have access to Myanmar [[02:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7514.66s)]
*  because of that military junta you mentioned. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7521.3s)]
*  But there does happen to be a team from Agence France-Presse, AFP, who are in the capital at the time of this earthquake. [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7524.18s)]
*  They have gone to the Napier d'Or General Hospital, which has now also declared mass casualties. [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7530.18s)]
*  They spoke to some doctors who are dealing with a huge influx. [[02:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7537.14s)]
*  It's a large hospital. It's got a thousand beds. [[02:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7540.900000000001s)]
*  And they also are struggling to deal with the influx of people arriving to be treated. [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7543.06s)]
*  One of those doctors said that he hasn't seen anything like this before. [[02:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7549.78s)]
*  We are trying to handle the situation. I'm so exhausted. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7554.179999999999s)]
*  Those doctors telling AFP hundreds of people are arriving. [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7557.7s)]
*  But also that part of the emergency building of that hospital has also collapsed, [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7560.66s)]
*  which of course is complicating their efforts to try and treat these people who are arriving on an ongoing basis. [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7565.7s)]
*  Absolutely. Giving you a sense of where these places are. [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7572.66s)]
*  We know that the epicenter is Sagan. That is near Mandalay. [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7576.34s)]
*  Mandalay itself is Myanmar's second biggest city. It's home to around one and a half million people. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7580.66s)]
*  And these are pictures from the airport in Mandalay. [[02:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7586.820000000001s)]
*  At the moment, the earthquake struck. People went down. People saying get down, sit down. [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7590.820000000001s)]
*  You can see that everyone going down on the floor when this shaking happened. [[02:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7596.42s)]
*  So there is a lot of confusion, of course, in that area. [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7601.14s)]
*  We've been talking about the capital, Napier. That is around 100 kilometres north of where the epicenter happened. [[02:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7605.46s)]
*  And Julia, the issue now, particularly as we are getting near nightfall, is going to be getting people into that area. [[02:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7615.06s)]
*  The Red Cross already saying they're having difficulty getting there. [[02:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7622.9s)]
*  Right. The Red Cross saying that the power outages are severely hampering their efforts. [[02:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7626.66s)]
*  Worth bringing a little update from the EU. [[02:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7631.78s)]
*  Ursula von der Leyen has said that Europe's Copernicus satellites are already helping first responders. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7635.22s)]
*  But of course, they need daylight in order to operate. [[02:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7640.179999999999s)]
*  So that is going to be something that severely impacts those rescue efforts. [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7643.78s)]
*  A really interesting piece of context that I'd like to bring you from our former Asia editor, Rebecca Henschke, [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7648.74s)]
*  who says that Sagan, which is this city very close to the epicenter, that is a stronghold, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7654.9s)]
*  she says, of pro-democracy protests in that civil war the last few years. [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7659.62s)]
*  Recent BBC data projects reveals that a patch of groups in control of Sagan, [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7664.18s)]
*  it's under the control of opposition and rebel groups, which is obviously going to impact access to those rescue efforts. [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7670.5s)]
*  The military junta now only has full control of a quarter of the country. [[02:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7680.0199999999995s)]
*  This is difficult diplomatically because Myanmar is under crippling international sanctions. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7685.46s)]
*  Absolutely. So we know that in Myanmar, the state media is saying two bridges have collapsed, buildings damaged in five cities. [[02:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7690.82s)]
*  These are the live pictures from Bangkok, because as we've been reporting, the quake was felt heavily in Thailand. [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7699.06s)]
*  And it's a thousand kilometres away from the epicenter. [[02:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7708.02s)]
*  And you can see that there is an emergency operation ongoing there, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7712.5s)]
*  because we know that 81 people are currently trapped inside the rubble of that building that collapsed. [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7716.98s)]
*  The building was being constructed, a 30-storey building. [[02:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7724.1s)]
*  We know that seven people did get out, but we understand from the authorities that there were 320 workers on the site at the time of the collapse. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7727.94s)]
*  And we can see that the light is going there as it gets dark, coming up to half past six in the evening in Bangkok. [[02:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7738.34s)]
*  Let's go live there to Jack Brown, who's lived in Bangkok for 10 years. [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7744.900000000001s)]
*  He was driving on the motorway when he saw the construction building collapse. [[02:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7748.820000000001s)]
*  And Jack, I understand you're still stuck on the road. Just describe what happened. [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7753.14s)]
*  Well, yeah, I just left my office and I was driving to visit a client for a 2pm appointment. [[02:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7759.38s)]
*  And around about 1.30, initially I thought I had a puncture in a tyre because the car was sort of shaking a little bit. [[02:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7765.06s)]
*  And immediately I thought to pull over to the left-hand side and noticed all of the other traffic on the road was sort of driving quite haphazardly and slowing down, pulling in. [[02:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7771.700000000001s)]
*  And it was only when I pulled the car in and put the car stationary, I realised the car was still moving around a lot. [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7781.860000000001s)]
*  And it was immediately at that point that I knew it was an earthquake, [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7787.700000000001s)]
*  which is strange because Bangkok doesn't really suffer from earthquakes. [[02:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7791.94s)]
*  It's the first one I've ever experienced since living here, more than 10 years. [[02:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7795.94s)]
*  And I think people were taken aback by it. Nobody was prepared or planned or really knew how to respond to an earthquake. [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7800.259999999999s)]
*  As the traffic sort of eased a little, we tried to continue on and just seen the building collapse right to the left of us there, as you can see in the footage. [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7810.98s)]
*  And we were just shocked. I mean, as you can see by the footage, it's just raw footage taken by my girlfriend in the car at the time. [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7820.74s)]
*  Everyone was just absolutely shocked and parked up their cars. People got out of the cars just in fright, really. [[02:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7829.0599999999995s)]
*  Didn't really know what to do or whether to just stop and wait on this elevated expressway, whether to continue on. [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7838.0199999999995s)]
*  And since then, it's just been absolute chaos. I mean, all of the high rise condominiums, hotels, shopping malls, offices, everyone had been evacuated for safety reasons. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7846.02s)]
*  And it's only around about now. I think that they're letting people back into these buildings. [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7858.02s)]
*  So all of these people outside in 38, 39 degree heat, obviously unprepared. [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7861.860000000001s)]
*  Some people didn't have shoes on when wearing tops or t-shirts, didn't even have time to grab their things from their office. [[02:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7866.42s)]
*  And it's just been jammed on the road since then. We tried to turn around and head back to the office. [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7874.42s)]
*  That was from half past one. It's now half past six and I'm still not even 10 percent of the way back. [[02:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7878.9800000000005s)]
*  So, Jack, we have been showing those very dramatic pictures of the moment of the collapse, which you witnessed. [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7886.5s)]
*  And you're saying that it is chaos. How far have you managed to get away from there in that traffic jam? [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7893.3s)]
*  Probably about three kilometres, four kilometres, three miles or so. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7900.5s)]
*  And have you ever, you've been living there for a while, have you ever witnessed any form of earthquake or shock in the area? [[02:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7904.66s)]
*  None whatsoever. So for me, at first, you know, my immediate reaction wasn't, is it an earthquake? [[02:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7913.38s)]
*  That's why I thought it was the car. But then when you're parked stationary and you realise everybody is also doing the same thing, [[02:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7920.26s)]
*  you just know it's an earthquake. And then I had a telephone call from my secretary saying, are you guys OK? [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7929.0599999999995s)]
*  There's an earthquake going on and what have you. So it was very, very shocking indeed. [[02:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7935.299999999999s)]
*  And my immediate reaction was to think about the people in the construction site of that building that tragically collapsed. [[02:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7940.58s)]
*  I mean, it is an active construction site. And you know that there's going to be people in there. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7948.9s)]
*  Just to see that come down, you immediately know there's going to be casualties. [[02:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7954.82s)]
*  And I think even the latest news now, there's still over 80 people unaccounted for. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7958.1s)]
*  Yes, we've been seeing the pictures from the scene of the emergency services there. [[02:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7962.820000000001s)]
*  And as you as you've been saying, the traffic completely jammed in and around that area. [[02:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7967.620000000001s)]
*  And as you mentioned, 81 people, the deputy prime minister saying trapped in the building. [[02:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7974.34s)]
*  What have the authorities been saying, particularly say on social media, or has it just been a case of everyone's been using their common sense? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7979.46s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not 100 percent sure because I've been behind the wheel most of the time. [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7989.06s)]
*  I've only just swapped now to all this interview and my girlfriend's driving. [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7992.900000000001s)]
*  So I haven't looked on social media much. [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=7996.5s)]
*  But I have from what I have seen, mostly a lot of people sharing their experiences, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8000.740000000001s)]
*  damage the buildings that they're living in or the offices that they work at, cracks in walls and things like this. [[02:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8004.9800000000005s)]
*  And I think there's been a lot of concern of people wondering if the building that they're residing in or working in is actually safe. [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8010.18s)]
*  Because aside from a collapsed building, there's also damage to other buildings. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8016.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, you've got these sort of two or three apartment buildings that have sky bridges and stuff that have been detached or there's damage between the buildings. [[02:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8021.700000000001s)]
*  So I think there's going to be some long term structural damage that needs to be assessed and properly fixed. [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8030.18s)]
*  Jack, thank you very much for joining us live as you are traveling away from the scene of that collapse. [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8037.3s)]
*  As you said, your girlfriend is driving. It's not you driving at the moment. [[02:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8042.82s)]
*  Appreciate your time live there in Bangkok. [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8045.86s)]
*  I'll tell you back to those live pictures from Bangkok where that rescue operation is going on. [[02:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8049.7s)]
*  We know that 81 people are currently trapped inside that building that has collapsed, a 30 story building that was under construction collapsed there. [[02:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8054.42s)]
*  This all after the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that has struck Myanmar. [[02:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8064.34s)]
*  That is a thousand kilometers away from Bangkok and Thailand. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8069.54s)]
*  We know that a state of emergency has been declared across large parts of Myanmar at the epicenter close to the country's second biggest city, Mandalay, home to one and a half million people. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8074.58s)]
*  Communication networks are down in parts of the country. [[02:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8087.3s)]
*  The United States Geological Survey warning that the disaster is likely to be widespread with the death toll reaching into the thousands. [[02:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8091.0599999999995s)]
*  The major hospital in the capital, Napier Door, has declared a mass casualty event, some of the wounded being treated outdoors. [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8099.86s)]
*  We will keep you updated. We have a live page up and running on the BBC News website and app. [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8109.62s)]
*  You can scan the QR code that is on the right hand side of your screen and that'll take you there. [[02:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8114.419999999999s)]
*  A powerful earthquake has struck Myanmar. [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8120.98s)]
*  The US Geological Service said it's had a magnitude of 7.7. [[02:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8128.58s)]
*  The epicenter was near the city of Mandalay. [[02:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8133.0599999999995s)]
*  Initial reports suggested caused significant damage. [[02:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8136.099999999999s)]
*  Strong tremors from the same earthquake had been felt in Bangkok in neighboring Thailand. [[02:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8139.62s)]
*  Joining us from Bangkok is Bui Tu, a resident in the city. [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8145.62s)]
*  Thank you for joining us on Newsday. Just tell us what happened where you are. [[02:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8150.34s)]
*  Hello, I'm here in Bangkok city and I wasn't home cooking. [[02:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8156.1s)]
*  Well, I felt the first strike and I was very nervous and I was very panicked. [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8160.98s)]
*  I didn't know what it was because it has been, I think, a decade since Bangkok had a really strong or powerful earthquake. [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8166.9s)]
*  So we, and then the second strike, I had to run onto the street and I saw a lot of people did the same thing out of the buildings because it's a big condo, a big apartment. [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8176.26s)]
*  So everyone ran onto the street and I saw the swimming pools, you know, like pooling water. [[02:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8189.62s)]
*  And we were very, you know, literally in panic because for the context, I think there has been an earthquake like this powerful in Bangkok for decades. [[02:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8198.5s)]
*  And Thailand is not an earthquake zone. So nearly all earthquakes with a were felt in Bangkok are in Myanmar. [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8214.98s)]
*  So that's for that reason. Buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for large earthquakes. [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8224.74s)]
*  So that's why I think that it's going to be a big damage in structure. [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8232.58s)]
*  So, and some are reported to have collapsed. Some buildings have collapsed already. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8238.9s)]
*  So I'm still monitoring the news. [[02:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8244.98s)]
*  Yeah, I'm safe now. [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8248.42s)]
*  You're safe now. We're thankful for that. [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8251.300000000001s)]
*  Just tell us what you saw around. [[02:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8254.18s)]
*  You mentioned the tremors. Any damage? [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8256.66s)]
*  Any people hurt where you are? [[02:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8260.02s)]
*  In my apartment, I just see some cracking on the wall and water splashed out of the swimming pools. [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8264.820000000002s)]
*  So and people just like yelling and they were like poor or on the exit, you know, [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8274.34s)]
*  exit floors. So we're trying to, you know, get our head around what's going on. [[02:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8282.66s)]
*  So we just like standing on the street for a long time until we have another announcement. [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8288.98s)]
*  Should we go back to our dream or not? [[02:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8294.18s)]
*  So it was literally the panic on the face of a lot of people [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8296.82s)]
*  because not only Thai people but foreigners haven't had this kind of like, [[02:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8301.699999999999s)]
*  you know, experiences as well. So we were so, you know, panic. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8306.58s)]
*  Yes, I can imagine. And it's around 20 past two in the afternoon there in Thailand. [[02:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8313.3s)]
*  I imagine lots of people would have been at work, at school, and as you were saying, you were [[02:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8320.34s)]
*  at home cooking. [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8325.779999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I can sort of some friends calling me that they were stuck in on the SkyTrain. [[02:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8327.06s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's a very, you know, big thing for a lot of people because, like I said, [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8334.74s)]
*  it's we have an experience earthquake for decades. So we didn't know that it's real. [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8342.5s)]
*  It's a real earthquake in the first place. And a lot of people definitely didn't know how to react [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8348.74s)]
*  to that. So some of them still have to wrap their head around to the minute that we decide to run [[02:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8354.74s)]
*  on the street or find a place to hide. So I hope that everyone is going to be safe. [[02:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8361.62s)]
*  But, you know, I can see that a lot of people that are in panic. [[02:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8367.78s)]
*  When I ran out of the room, I can see a lot of people that they don't know [[02:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8371.86s)]
*  should they go or they should stay at home inside the room. [[02:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8376.18s)]
*  So I really hope that people are going to be safe. [[02:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8380.9s)]
*  And you mentioned the SkyTrains, these elevated train transit systems high up in the sky there [[02:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8385.14s)]
*  in Bangkok. We understand that the government will be holding a special meeting as a result [[02:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8394.02s)]
*  of the earthquake. Has the government given you any special next? [[02:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8400.66s)]
*  Oh, we haven't received anything yet. But at that time, the BTS, sorry, the SkyTrain staff [[02:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8405.54s)]
*  has announced to flee people. So I think that they managed to control the situation. [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8414.42s)]
*  But because this is very, you know, unexpected experience for everyone. So we were very panic. [[02:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8423.78s)]
*  So I think that, you know, maybe there's going to be some chaos, of course. [[02:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8433.22s)]
*  But the situation seems under control now. [[02:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8438.66s)]
*  Bui, too. Thank you for speaking to us despite being in a very difficult situation. [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8442.179999999998s)]
*  Of course, we can also hear the emotion and the shock in your voice. [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8446.98s)]
*  Thank you for speaking to us here on Newsday. That's Bui, too, telling us about this [[02:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8450.74s)]
*  earthquake that has struck in Myanmar and tremors from the same earthquake have also [[02:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8456.82s)]
*  been felt in Bangkok, where Bui, too, was speaking to us from. [[02:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8462.26s)]
*  You're with BBC News and our breaking news out of Southeast Asia this hour, [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8468.02s)]
*  where there has been a major earthquake. It hit central Myanmar with strong tremors being felt [[02:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8472.26s)]
*  in Thailand and southwest China. Now, the main quake hit at 0620 GMT, that's 1250 local time, [[02:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8478.1s)]
*  with a magnitude of 7.7. The epicentre was close to Myanmar's second city, [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8486.9s)]
*  Mandalay. Ten minutes later, an aftershock with a magnitude of 6.4 was recorded. [[02:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8494.02s)]
*  Now, the full scale of the damage in Myanmar is still unclear. Details are coming in. [[02:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8501.779999999999s)]
*  The quake was strong enough to buckle roads around the capital, [[02:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8508.66s)]
*  Napier door, and a major hospital in the capital has declared a mass casualty area. [[02:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8512.98s)]
*  Some of the wounded are being treated outdoors. The military authorities say there is a six [[02:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8519.46s)]
*  areas are now under a state of emergency. Close to the epicentre, several spans of this major [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8525.94s)]
*  river bridge, which you can see on screen, have collapsed. This is near the epicentre, [[02:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8532.58s)]
*  which is near the city of Mandalay. Now, whenever there is an earthquake, a lot of video is [[02:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8538.82s)]
*  posted on social media. We saw that video of the moment that the building came down, important that [[02:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8545.539999999999s)]
*  we hear at the BBC, make sure that we verify all of the pictures before we show them. So that is [[02:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8554.1s)]
*  what our team is doing at the moment. And Jake Horton is part of the BBC Verify team and he's [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8559.38s)]
*  with me in the studio. So Jake, it is difficult whenever there is a disaster, there's a lot of [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8564.74s)]
*  video posted on social media. You've been going through it. [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8570.58s)]
*  Yes, everyone at the team at BBC Verify has been going through a slew of video that comes in to [[02:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8573.22s)]
*  verify if it's genuine, if it's recent, if it's new, and if it shows the earthquake in Myanmar. [[02:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8578.02s)]
*  And one of the biggest difficulties we found is that internet access in Myanmar is restricted [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8584.82s)]
*  since the military took over the country in 2021. And also, obviously, there's service issues at [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8591.14s)]
*  the moment, because there's been a major earthquake in the country. We have managed to verify some [[02:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8596.18s)]
*  videos out of Myanmar, including one we can play for you now, which shows the scene at Mandalay [[02:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8601.3s)]
*  International Airport, which is about 18 kilometres from the epicentre of the earthquake. And in the [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8606.66s)]
*  video, you can see about a couple dozen people taking cover on the tarmac of that airport. [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8611.619999999999s)]
*  And you can also see in the video, you can see the triangular structures on the roof, [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8617.94s)]
*  they're quite distinctive. And we can pair those triangular structures you can see on the roof [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8624.66s)]
*  of that airport hangar to satellite images we have on Google Earth. So that's how we [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8629.86s)]
*  confirm that that airport was taken at Mandalay Airport. And we also do reverse image searches, [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8636.66s)]
*  which tell us how recent that video was. And we can say that video was posted this morning, [[02:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8642.34s)]
*  there are no earlier versions of that video online that we can find. So we can say where it is, [[02:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8647.54s)]
*  and how recent it was. I find this fascinating you as the teammate, and you're saying literally, [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8651.86s)]
*  because those buildings have the triangular bits at the top, that is how you can confirm that that [[02:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8657.460000000001s)]
*  is Mandalay. Yes, they're quite distinctive. You can see the colours and the patterns on the [[02:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8663.7s)]
*  triangular formations on the top of that roof are quite distinctive. And you can look at aerial [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8667.54s)]
*  pictures of Mandalay Airport on Google Earth, and they're quite easy to match up. So yeah, [[02:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8671.140000000001s)]
*  that is how we verified that one. And there's also been more footage out of Bangkok. You've [[02:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8676.58s)]
*  been reporting on the skyscraper that collapsed, the 30 story skyscraper that collapsed, and we [[02:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8682.02s)]
*  managed to verify two pieces of video of that. This is one from close up just below the building [[02:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8686.5s)]
*  as it collapses. And we also have another one which is further away. And we managed to do that [[02:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8692.58s)]
*  by looking at Google Street View in Bangkok. And the building is in the northeast of the city, [[02:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8697.7s)]
*  and the exterior of the building on Google Street View matches the exterior of the building we see [[02:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8704.02s)]
*  in this video. So it's about 30 stories high, like you said, it's under construction, but images on [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8708.66s)]
*  Google Street View at the end of last year match the exterior, and we confirm it is where it is [[02:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8713.300000000001s)]
*  by doing that sort of work at BBC Verify. And you also mentioned with the pictures from Mandalay, [[02:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8718.66s)]
*  this reverse image search. Just explain how that works. Yeah, so it sounds more complicated and [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8724.02s)]
*  scientific than what it is basically. Basically, you take screen grabs of videos and you put them [[02:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8731.54s)]
*  through a search engine like Google or the other reverse image search engines, and that will give [[02:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8736.42s)]
*  you previous results of when that image was posted elsewhere online before. And it's not 100% certain, [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8741.140000000001s)]
*  there might be times where certain results don't come up. But for instance, in this case, we can [[02:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8747.7s)]
*  see that no images matching that skyscraper or the similar images we saw at Mandalay Airport [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8752.02s)]
*  have appeared online before this morning. So we can say with a good degree of certainty [[02:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8758.26s)]
*  that they haven't been posted before, so they're likely to be recent images of the incident. [[02:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8764.82s)]
*  Our main news, which is that massive earthquake, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that has hit Myanmar. [[02:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8848.26s)]
*  I want to take you to the live pictures from Bangkok. Now, the reason that we are taking you [[02:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8868.02s)]
*  there is because the quake was felt there and a 30-storey building that was under construction [[02:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8873.22s)]
*  has collapsed. And this is just coming up to seven o'clock, quarter to seven in the evening in Bangkok. [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8880.66s)]
*  So the lights have been brought out to try and illuminate this scene. Now, this building, this [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8886.58s)]
*  30-storey building that was under construction collapsed. We know that there are currently 81 [[02:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8892.74s)]
*  people who are trapped inside that building. And there is a big operation underway. We've seen dogs [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8899.14s)]
*  and equipment being taken in there to try and get them out. We understand that some of them [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8905.539999999999s)]
*  were in lifts at the time. A figure earlier said that 20 people were in lifts inside that area that [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8910.66s)]
*  has come down. And as I said, the authorities are sending search and rescue teams into the [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8920.5s)]
*  area. 81 people. We're also getting a bit more information about the number working on the site. [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8929.460000000001s)]
*  The Thai public health minister now saying there was as many as 409 people working on the site [[02:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8936.26s)]
*  when it collapsed. So as is often the case in these situations, details become clearer as time [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8944.02s)]
*  goes on. So 409 people working on the site when it collapsed. Earlier they said that 70 people were [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8950.58s)]
*  trapped. It is now 81 people that are missing at that site and that operation going on. Now, [[02:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8958.58s)]
*  we've been talking to people who witnessed the earthquake. One of them is Fraser Morton. He's [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8966.5s)]
*  a filmmaker who was in Bangkok when it happened. And I want to show you the footage that he filmed. [[02:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8972.74s)]
*  Let's take a look at that. So this is his footage of people as they have come outside. Of course, [[02:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8978.74s)]
*  lots of people were in buildings and they went for safety to open areas. You can see this is near [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8986.66s)]
*  those high rise buildings. Also water. He recorded at the time a description of what happened. Let's [[02:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8992.82s)]
*  have a listen to that. I'm currently in a park just off Sukhumvit Road, one of Bangkok's busiest [[02:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=8999.78s)]
*  tourist destinations and shopping streets. And as you can see behind me, there are [[02:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9007.86s)]
*  thousands of people who have come to this park to try and stay safe in case there are any more [[02:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9012.1s)]
*  aftershocks. It's about an hour now since the earthquake struck. And when it did, I was in that [[02:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9017.220000000001s)]
*  white shopping mall that you can see behind me called the EM quarter. I was in a camera store [[02:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9023.140000000001s)]
*  and the whole building began to shake. Immediately people began to scream. There was a lot of chaos. [[02:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9028.1s)]
*  There were sounds of debris falling and everybody ran as fast as they could out to street level. [[02:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9034.5s)]
*  And when we got outside, these tall buildings that you can see were shaking in the background. [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9040.1s)]
*  And so this is not something that Bangkok residents are used to. Earthquakes happen very rarely here. [[02:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9046.34s)]
*  And so now everybody just has to wait and see and try and stay safe in this park. [[02:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9052.74s)]
*  Well, that is Fraser a little while ago. He can now join us live from Bangkok. Fraser, [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9057.38s)]
*  you're a reporter in Making There. Just describe to us what the scene is there now as it's beginning [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9061.94s)]
*  to get dark in Bangkok. Well, yeah, as you can see, the sun is setting on quite a monumental day [[02:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9067.86s)]
*  in Bangkok. There's lots of people still milling around. I think a lot of people don't really know [[02:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9075.94s)]
*  what to do. Yeah, like I said earlier, I think that people in Bangkok are not really used to [[02:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9081.62s)]
*  earthquakes. And so actually having communication is coming through in dribs and drabs. And so [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9088.5s)]
*  there's a lot of people here. There's maybe a thousand people still in this park. But I did [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9095.94s)]
*  go out onto the streets about 20 minutes ago and Bangkok life seems to be resuming. We heard a [[02:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9099.380000000001s)]
*  little bit in what you filmed. Just describe the moment that the earthquake happened and what you [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9106.5s)]
*  felt. Oh, well, there was there's that split second when we initially felt the tremor. [[02:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9112.26s)]
*  And you pause for a moment because you don't know how big this earthquake is going to be. [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9121.78s)]
*  And I've been in a few earthquakes in different parts of the world, but it was immediately clear [[02:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9126.02s)]
*  that this was something big and something different. And so panic set in pretty quickly. [[02:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9130.18s)]
*  Yeah, everyone just rushing to try and get out. I was on the third floor of a shopping mall. [[02:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9137.46s)]
*  I ended up running down an escalator the wrong way. People obviously panicking and screaming. [[02:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9142.74s)]
*  And then we got out onto the street. And because you're in Bangkok, the immediate thing to do is [[02:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9147.46s)]
*  you look up because there's so many skyscrapers around. And yeah, it was building swaying, [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9152.26s)]
*  debris. And also there was a swimming pool nearby that was overflowing as well. And so, [[02:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9159.62s)]
*  yeah, it was it was pretty intense. And Fraser, what was other people who obviously have come out [[02:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9165.62s)]
*  onto the streets, you've managed to speak to them. What have they been saying to you? [[02:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9172.5s)]
*  Yeah, I spoke to three young guys from the UK who are here on holiday. They were in a hotel nearby [[02:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9177.300000000001s)]
*  Sukhumvit Road, which is one of the main tourist destination, tourist areas in Bangkok. Their hotel [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9183.86s)]
*  room, they said the plaster was falling off the walls. The whole building was shaking. And so they [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9189.78s)]
*  just ran out as fast as they could. But obviously they couldn't use the elevators. So they had to [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9195.06s)]
*  run down flights and stairs. I did actually also speak to a tourist from Myanmar in the park that [[02:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9200.26s)]
*  I've been in. He's here with his elderly family. And he's devastated, of course, just hearing the [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9205.619999999999s)]
*  news coming out of out of his home country. Absolutely. So you have said that some people [[02:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9210.98s)]
*  are sort of deciding when to and if to go back into buildings. I suppose the concern is if there are [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9217.539999999999s)]
*  any aftershocks. Yeah, exactly. I think that's what people are doing in this park. I don't know [[02:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9223.38s)]
*  if you can see behind me, but there's still a couple of thousand people in this park that I'm at. [[02:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9229.859999999999s)]
*  From a personal sense, I guess it was lucky that I was so close to this park. [[02:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9236.019999999999s)]
*  But so many people in Bangkok, there's just so many high rise buildings and there's very little [[02:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9240.9s)]
*  open space like I'm currently in just now. So people are kind of seeking refuge, I guess. [[02:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9245.38s)]
*  Yes, yeah, just letting the day sink in and just hanging out here until they get more updates. [[02:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9251.14s)]
*  And I suppose as the night goes on, that will become a bigger decision for people to make [[02:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9258.66s)]
*  as it gets later. Yeah, exactly. I mean, there are not as many people as there was earlier today [[02:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9265.14s)]
*  when I first arrived here, but there are still quite a lot of people deciding to stay and wait [[02:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9271.779999999999s)]
*  on more news updates as they come. Fraser, we do appreciate your time and stay safe there in Bangkok. [[02:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9278.42s)]
*  That's Fraser Morton joining us live from Bangkok. Let me take you back to another area of Bangkok. [[02:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9285.94s)]
*  This is where that rescue operation is going on at the scene of that collapsed building. It's a [[02:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9291.62s)]
*  30-storey building that came down when the earthquake struck. We now know that 81 people [[02:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9297.86s)]
*  are trapped inside that wreckage at the moment. They are sending search and rescue teams. We've [[02:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9306.34s)]
*  seen dogs going into that area and equipment and the authorities trying to rescue the people that [[02:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9314.02s)]
*  are stuck inside. We heard earlier that at least 20 were stuck in lifts that obviously when buildings [[02:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9320.74s)]
*  are being constructed, lifts are designed to get the workers up and down. So that's the scene live [[02:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9327.62s)]
*  in the Thai capital Bangkok. But a reminder that this earthquake actually struck a thousand [[02:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9333.38s)]
*  kilometres away from Thailand in Myanmar. And I want to show you some of the latest pictures [[02:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9339.779999999999s)]
*  that state TV are showing in Myanmar. And you can see that there's damage in the area. Now, [[02:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9346.42s)]
*  I don't know where these pictures are from, but they look similar to ones that we saw earlier from [[02:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9354.019999999999s)]
*  Napier Dor, which is the capital. It's about 100 kilometres north of where the epicentre was. Now, [[02:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9358.74s)]
*  the epicentre itself was in the city of Sagan. That is near a big city called Mandalay. And you [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9366.66s)]
*  can see there that there is damage to buildings and people are out and about on the streets. [[02:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9376.5s)]
*  We know that the humanitarian situation already difficult and there lots of damage and wreckage. [[02:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9385.22s)]
*  Myanmar's isolated military governments made a rare request for international help after that [[02:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9393.38s)]
*  powerful earthquake hit the country. A spokesman in the capital told the French news agency AFP [[02:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9400.34s)]
*  that humanitarian aid was needed as soon as possible. As I said, the quakes epicentre was [[02:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9406.42s)]
*  near the city of Mandalay. That is home to one and a half million people. But these, [[02:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9414.02s)]
*  the latest pictures that state TV is showing in Myanmar of the aftermath of that earthquake, [[02:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9420.58s)]
*  a 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck at around 620 GMT. Do stay with us here on BBC News. These [[02:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9428.74s)]
*  are the live pictures from Bangkok. Christian Fraser will have the very latest in BBC News now. [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9437.78s)]
*  That's coming up at the top of the hour here on BBC News. Let's go to Tom Beeston, who lives and [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9442.98s)]
*  works in Bangkok and joins us now. Tom, thank you very much for your time here on BBC News. Can [[02:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9453.38s)]
*  you describe what happened to you when the quake struck? Yeah, it was one of the weirdest things [[02:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9458.18s)]
*  I've ever lived for, to be honest. We were on the 31st floor of our co-working building. I was with [[02:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9464.26s)]
*  a friend and he kind of looked at me funny and said, like, oh, I think I've got bird to go. And [[02:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9468.34s)]
*  then suddenly everyone else around us started also, you know, looking at each other. And then [[02:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9472.42s)]
*  people, thankfully, were with us and people knew what they were doing. They ducked straight under [[02:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9477.220000000001s)]
*  the desks. And you have that moment where you don't really know what's happening. Then it suddenly [[02:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9480.9s)]
*  clicks. Oh, this is an earthquake. So, yeah, we kind of got under our desk, ducked, covered. [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9484.82s)]
*  And then there was that weird period where because we were so high up, we were like, [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9489.779999999999s)]
*  are we better off sheltering here or should we kind of try and get downstairs as quickly as [[02:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9493.14s)]
*  possible? So then before we knew it, we were all rushing down the stairs as fast as we can with, [[02:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9496.9s)]
*  you know, hundreds of other people around us. And yeah, it was chaos. How long did the tremor go [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9501.46s)]
*  on for? And you say you were on the 31st floor. What were the other people around you like on [[02:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9508.02s)]
*  that floor? Yeah, I mean, it was confusion and then a bit of panic and then just kind of trying [[02:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9513.94s)]
*  to get yourself together to actually think about what to do. But, you know, we could see the [[02:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9520.26s)]
*  building really felt like it was shaking. We could also see across from us swimming pools and other [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9526.26s)]
*  buildings were overflowing. So then when you realize that an earthquake is actually happening, [[02:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9530.9s)]
*  it's then OK, we need to get ourselves downstairs. But it's very confusing, very panicky. And yeah. [[02:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9535.54s)]
*  So you ended up on the street outside. How many other people were there and what was their [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9543.14s)]
*  reaction, the other people there? There was hundreds and hundreds of people. The roads are [[02:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9548.98s)]
*  all gridlocked as well. And it was mainly people on phones trying to call family, friends, kind of [[02:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9553.86s)]
*  see what's going on, see if everything's OK. And again, it's just you sometimes look at people [[02:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9559.7s)]
*  and kind of laugh because you don't know what's just happened and what you've just been through. [[02:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9564.02s)]
*  Look at other people, you just kind of have a disbelieved shock. And yeah. [[02:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9567.62s)]
*  How long have you lived in Bangkok and have you ever witnessed anything like this before? [[02:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9573.54s)]
*  Being in Thailand for about 18 months now, and no, and it's one of those things where [[02:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9580.18s)]
*  you never think it can happen to you. And that's why at the start, there was such a period of [[02:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9585.060000000001s)]
*  not knowing what was going on. And I had a thought, oh, this is an earthquake. Then a [[02:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9589.62s)]
*  secondary thought of, no, it can't be, that wouldn't happen here. But then you very honestly [[02:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9593.86s)]
*  sit in. And yes, the first time I've ever experienced something like this. [[02:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9598.82s)]
*  You mentioned the swimming pools. Let me show our audience, if they're watching here on BBC [[02:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9603.220000000001s)]
*  News, exactly what you were talking about. So it's pools on the top of these very tall [[02:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9607.54s)]
*  apartment buildings. And the strength of the shaking meant that the water came over, [[02:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9612.66s)]
*  Tom, almost like a waterfall. Yeah. I thought one building had like a [[02:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9617.78s)]
*  burst pipe or something, because from our angle, it was just torrents and torrents of water coming [[02:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9622.74s)]
*  outside. And what have the emergency services said? Have you had any messages about what you are [[02:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9627.38s)]
*  supposed to do? Or was it a case of the people who were outside a bit of common sense going on? [[02:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9633.94s)]
*  Yeah, definitely a long period of staying outside, not going back into buildings, [[02:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9639.3s)]
*  things like that, because aftershocks are common. And for a long time after, I think we were sat [[02:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9643.619999999999s)]
*  outside the building for a good 90 minutes, just everyone just kind of sat there, not really sure [[02:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9648.18s)]
*  when to move or what to do. And we walked to go find like an outdoor area and there were closed [[02:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9652.9s)]
*  businesses with the staff kind of sitting outside. Everyone just kind of sat around talking. And it's [[02:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9658.58s)]
*  definitely like an air of uncertainty of kind of when to go back to normal and how long you kind [[02:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9662.98s)]
*  of should wait in this kind of circumstance. And you're obviously inside at the moment. [[02:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9667.220000000001s)]
*  Have you gone back into the building or have you gone somewhere else? [[02:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9672.58s)]
*  We did. We waited about an hour to 90 minutes and we sprinted up the 31 flights of stairs to get [[02:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9676.419999999998s)]
*  our laptops. Not sure if that's the best judgment call. I'm not saying we should have done that, [[02:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9682.9s)]
*  but we didn't trust the lifts. So we had a very sweaty run up to the 31st floor and a very quick [[02:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9686.74s)]
*  sprint back downstairs just so we could get away from the city centre and get ourselves to an open [[02:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9691.22s)]
*  area with our valuables. Concerned, I assume, that there might be aftershocks? [[02:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9696.179999999998s)]
*  Yes, yeah exactly. You never know what you do hear about it. [[02:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9701.46s)]
*  Okay, Tom, thank you very much for your time. Appreciate it. Glad you're safe after that [[02:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9705.78s)]
*  experience on the 31st floor of that tower block. Appreciate your time. That's Tom Beeston who works [[02:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9710.58s)]
*  and lives in Bangkok. You're with BBC News. [[02:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9715.22s)]
*  Hello, I'm Christian Fraser. Welcome to BBC News. [[02:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9730.5s)]
*  A state of emergency is in place across an enormous swathe of South East Asia after a [[02:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9761.14s)]
*  powerful earthquake shook Myanmar, Thailand and parts of southwest China. The main quake came [[02:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9766.5s)]
*  during the early afternoon. It was recorded at 7.7 magnitude and just six miles deep. The epicentre [[02:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9772.74s)]
*  was close to Myanmar's second city, Mandalay. But there were powerful tremors felt some 600 miles [[02:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9780.18s)]
*  away in the Thai capital Bangkok and far beyond. Ten minutes later there was a strong aftershock of [[02:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9786.1s)]
*  6.4. The reports of damage from Myanmar have been slow to emerge. This is a country embroiled in a [[02:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9792.5s)]
*  civil war but in the last hour the ruling military have asked for international help which is rare. [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9798.9s)]
*  The Red Cross said there are downed power lines in the Mandalay and Zhejiang regions. We've seen [[02:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9804.58s)]
*  videos and pictures of bridges collapsing, pagodas and temples destroyed and there are real [[02:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9810.1s)]
*  concerns now about the safety of several important dams. The pictures of the roads which you're [[02:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9816.02s)]
*  looking at which buckled around the capital, Nyipido, will give you some idea of the force [[02:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9821.7s)]
*  of the quake. A major hospital in the capital has been declared a mass casualty area. There are [[02:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9827.460000000001s)]
*  reports that some of the injured are being treated outdoors. Big tremors too in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[02:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9832.5s)]
*  The Department of Disaster Prevention there said the quake was felt in almost every region of the [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9839.78s)]
*  country. There are 17 million people in Bangkok and the surrounding suburbs, many of whom live in [[02:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9844.58s)]
*  these high-rise apartments. The main focus right now though is a rescue effort at a construction [[02:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9850.820000000002s)]
*  site in central Bangkok. They were pictures widely circulated on social media of a multi-story [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9857.300000000001s)]
*  building which collapsed with a crane on top of it into a cloud of dust. The Thai Defense Minister [[02:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9864.9s)]
*  says 81 people are trapped beneath that rubble. Three bodies have already been recovered from the site. [[02:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9871.38s)]
*  With us to begin our coverage, this is Panisa Emocheshi, a reporter for BBC Thai. Thank you very [[02:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9878.42s)]
*  much, Panisa, for being with us. Tell us where you are as the sun starts to go down. I'm sure [[02:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9883.859999999999s)]
*  there are plenty of anxious people in the city. What does it feel like there? [[02:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9889.7s)]
*  Yeah, so let's begin with arm scanning on the bridge that actually located near the collapsed [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9894.5s)]
*  building. If you can see behind me, this is more of the bird eye view into the buildings that collapsed. [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9899.54s)]
*  You can see over there does the pie of concrete from 30 story buildings that collapse. Next to that, [[02:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9905.62s)]
*  you can see that it's about three story tall at the moment and rescue teams has been going inside [[02:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9912.26s)]
*  since early in the afternoon. We have felt the shakiness of the earthquake at around 1 pm Thai time [[02:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9917.78s)]
*  and we already spoke BBC Thai and BBC already spoke to two of the workers who were actually [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9925.060000000001s)]
*  in that building at the time that there were earthquake and we feel the shaking that and they [[02:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9931.94s)]
*  were running for their life. And as you already mentioned, at the top of that 30 story building [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9936.980000000001s)]
*  construction, there were cranes and one of the workers that survived from that collapse said that [[02:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9942.34s)]
*  the moment he feel the shakiness, he looked back and he saw the crane on the top of the building [[02:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9950.02s)]
*  was start shaking as well. He was just running for his life and for a split moment he thought he [[02:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9955.460000000001s)]
*  could make it. So that's where we are. We've had a statement from the defence minister who says [[02:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9960.1s)]
*  they've pulled three bodies from the site. Do they have the teams on location at the moment [[02:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9968.1s)]
*  and do they know about the other eight or so people that are trapped beneath it? [[02:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9974.18s)]
*  Yeah, so it has been reported that about 400 people were working on the site and at the moment [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9979.94s)]
*  about 69 is still missing but you can see that the rescue team is still going because it's already [[02:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9985.62s)]
*  sunset and they've been setting light everywhere to try to make sure that they rescue everyone. [[02:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9992.9s)]
*  Let's talk about the wider situation. There is a state of emergency in place. What does that mean [[02:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=9998.66s)]
*  in real terms? What does that enable the government to do? So basically with Bangkok, the Bangkok [[02:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10004.82s)]
*  governor is basically one of the main ones but also every department that related for the [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10010.5s)]
*  government trying to do this and at the moment we're sitting on the street that no particular [[02:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10015.46s)]
*  ordinary car can walk by or can drive by because this street at the moment that led to the size of [[02:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10020.74s)]
*  the collapsed building is already full of rescues and full of equipment to be used for this rescue [[02:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10026.74s)]
*  team. So this emergency is really actually help worker and also helps rescue team to make sure [[02:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10033.699999999999s)]
*  that they can do their job especially. So in terms of the critical infrastructure, the transport [[02:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10040.82s)]
*  links, the roads, the power lines, a lot of that information still coming in. They've not had many [[02:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10047.06s)]
*  hours to get information from outside Bangkok but do we have a more considered assessment of how [[02:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10052.74s)]
*  far reaching the damage has been? Yeah so at the moment we still have like internet and everything [[02:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10060.18s)]
*  is still intact in line. Apart from this big collapsed building and that's went online because [[02:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10066.58s)]
*  of a very horrific scenes that everybody can see there are also some reports as well. There's some [[02:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10071.699999999999s)]
*  old buildings also have collapsed and also you can see some cracks. A lot of veterans also show [[02:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10076.98s)]
*  that their condominium or their apartment especially those with high rises they start [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10083.38s)]
*  seeing cracks or windows start cracking down as well because actually Thailand is really not familiar [[02:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10087.859999999999s)]
*  with this type of shakiness with this type of earthquake. This is one of the first time for many [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10094.58s)]
*  Thai especially those living in Bangkok to feeling this shakiness. I was on the ground. I was at my [[02:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10100.26s)]
*  house on the ground for the moment at 1 pm when it start to shake and you start feeling this [[02:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10106.9s)]
*  in us to the level I never felt before. Right. What will people do tonight? There'll be a lot of [[02:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10112.74s)]
*  worry, a lot of fear in the city. We've seen pictures of people outside on the streets. I [[02:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10119.460000000001s)]
*  know people in Thailand are used to this sort of thing but are people still feeling aftershocks? [[02:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10123.7s)]
*  Is there concern there's more to come? Yes, we are still concerned. Essentially earlier than this [[02:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10129.62s)]
*  because to be out earlier there's still report from an announcement from the government that warned [[02:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10135.78s)]
*  that there will be aftershock coming and it's been reported at least eight aftershocks coming in and [[02:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10141.460000000001s)]
*  happened after that 1 pm from big earthquake and we can see that actually around me, local citizens, [[02:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10147.62s)]
*  local citizens still up here on the bridge along with all the media personnel to witness the [[02:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10154.82s)]
*  list routine. So people at the scene at Chatuchak area was actually nearby the famous Chatuchak [[02:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10160.34s)]
*  market for all foreign militants that come to join Thailand. So we still see people here want to know [[02:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10166.02s)]
*  what happened. Some might fear but a lot of a lot of citizens also go back to their house and stay [[02:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10171.699999999999s)]
*  informed. Mainly they're waiting for what to come next. What was the announcement from the government [[02:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10178.34s)]
*  that advised to do? The advice for them. Perisa, thank you very much for that. We'll no doubt come [[02:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10183.62s)]
*  back to you through the course of the next few hours. Let's get a view then from someone else [[02:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10189.78s)]
*  who was in Bangkok, the filmmaker Mikko Shea. He was eating in a cafe when the earthquake struck [[02:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10195.460000000001s)]
*  and he rushed to help at a nearby hospital that was evacuating its patients. I've seen some of [[02:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10200.5s)]
*  those pictures actually. Where are you now and what can you tell us about the picture around you? [[02:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10206.1s)]
*  Yes, so I'm actually in a part of the King's Royal Palace in downtown Bangkok which is attached to [[02:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10212.9s)]
*  a hospital and they call the King Mongkut Hospital and I happened to be having a meal there when the [[02:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10218.34s)]
*  earthquake hit and like everyone else I rushed outside and to try and get away from the high-rise [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10224.82s)]
*  buildings because there was actually masonry and bits of concrete falling off the high-rises and [[02:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10229.78s)]
*  landing on the streets. So me and a bunch of people run across the road to a park and then [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10234.5s)]
*  I noticed that the hospital was being evacuated and it was quite chaotic because they started [[02:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10239.94s)]
*  bringing people out in wheelchairs and stretcher beds but then they must have run out of wheelchairs [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10244.26s)]
*  and stretcher beds. They were carrying people out by their arms and legs and on people's backs [[02:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10249.54s)]
*  so I ran in to try and help evacuate the hospital and I helped rescue one lady in a wheelchair get [[02:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10253.54s)]
*  there outside into the park and I went back to get someone else and then the security wouldn't [[02:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10260.18s)]
*  let me in but when I went back I saw that there was a car park on the road like where I was running [[02:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10265.060000000001s)]
*  back and forth and there was about like 200 kilos of concrete and masonry had landed on the car, [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10269.78s)]
*  smashed all the front windscreen, the whole bonnet was smashed in so it had obviously fallen from a [[02:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10276.02s)]
*  great height and it was very clear that if anyone was in the way of that they wouldn't survive so [[02:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10280.980000000001s)]
*  it was yeah quite intimidating to see that much stuff falling off the buildings. I imagine so. [[02:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10286.5s)]
*  Have you been in an earthquake before? I have actually yeah I was in a 7.9 Richter scale earthquake [[02:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10291.54s)]
*  in in Asia once before and that was I was right near the epicenter so that was a lot stronger [[02:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10297.46s)]
*  but there wasn't a lot of high rises around there so I think actually I felt safer in the [[02:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10302.5s)]
*  7.9 right near the epicenter than I did today in Bangkok because there's a lot of high rises [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10308.5s)]
*  around me with projectiles falling off of it. How long did it last? It lasted I would say at [[02:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10313.3s)]
*  least a minute so you know like it started when I was in this food court and I had time to like [[02:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10322.1s)]
*  get out of the food court, get across the street into the park and the things were still swaying [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10328.9s)]
*  I'd say at least a minute. Yeah I know I mean this is a subjective question but and it's difficult [[02:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10333.7s)]
*  I know from where you are to give a sort of assessment but news drifts in quite slowly [[02:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10338.74s)]
*  at the beginning of these sort of disasters. Do you get a sense that we don't know the half of it [[02:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10344.42s)]
*  at the moment? Yeah absolutely because like I can say I walked past about four buildings between [[02:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10348.26s)]
*  where I kind of helped to evacuate the building to the park and just along those four buildings [[02:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10354.98s)]
*  there was like hundreds of kilos and these were quite new buildings hundreds of kilos of concrete [[02:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10361.380000000001s)]
*  that had fallen off from great height and landed on the street and I assume I can only assume that [[02:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10366.5s)]
*  that's it's a similar circumstance all across the city and this is a city of 17 million people with [[02:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10371.94s)]
*  thousands of thousands of high-rise buildings so I think it must be similar throughout the city [[02:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10377.06s)]
*  I assume. And have you given thought as to where you'll go tonight what you will do? [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10382.82s)]
*  I'm sorry can you repeat that? Have you given any thought as to where you'll go tonight and what you [[02:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10388.18s)]
*  will do? The first thing I'm going to do when I leave the hospital here and get back to my apartment [[02:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10392.18s)]
*  is I'm going to do a bit of a structural assessment and figure out whether I want to sleep there [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10397.3s)]
*  tonight so I'm going to do a good walk around all of the car parks and the structural areas that I [[02:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10401.06s)]
*  can access and see if there's any cracks. Yeah that sounds pretty sensible to me and just in [[02:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10405.86s)]
*  terms of the the patients that were evacuated from the hospital have they been taken back in [[02:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10410.82s)]
*  or are they now being treated outside? So there's about 100 people in this room behind me and they [[02:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10415.140000000001s)]
*  are all the patients of the hospital there's that over a thousand people were evacuated most of them [[02:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10421.380000000001s)]
*  haven't been let back into the hospital yet because it hasn't been cleared by the authorities as being [[02:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10426.26s)]
*  structurally safe so they're actually going to spend the night here and I know for a fact that [[02:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10432.02s)]
*  there was two people had heart attacks just during the evacuation so obviously there's a lot of risks [[02:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10436.34s)]
*  that come with these sorts of things that carry on after the initial event so all these people that [[02:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10441.94s)]
*  should be in ICUs tonight they're actually in these makeshift rooms outside of hospitals. [[02:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10447.220000000001s)]
*  Goodness me quite a situation Mick it's really good to talk to you you take care thank you very [[02:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10452.66s)]
*  much for coming on the program. Thank you I'm sorry it's a bit noisy here no don't worry we [[02:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10457.38s)]
*  know it's there's a lot of commotion in Bangkok at the moment and now we've seen other pictures from [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10462.179999999998s)]
*  around the city of Bangkok of water pouring down the side of high-rise buildings this is water [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10467.14s)]
*  that's been sloshing out of the swimming pools on the top of the more upmarket skyscrapers. [[02:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10472.98s)]
*  In Myanmar we've been looking at pictures of the Arva Bridge near Mandalay it was first built by [[02:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10479.06s)]
*  the British Army in 1934 it spans the Irawadi River there are 16 sections to this bridge [[02:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10484.74s)]
*  but you will see there that many of them are now in the water it's not clear if anyone was hurt [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10492.74s)]
*  but it's a pretty old bridge that one and you will see as we pan to the right that there's another [[02:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10497.46s)]
*  crossing just next to it which was more recently built which appears to be still standing. We're [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10501.86s)]
*  going to get a more considered view from Myanmar just after this break. Around the world and across [[02:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10508.18s)]
*  the UK you're watching BBC News. [[02:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10513.14s)]
*  Right we're going to continue our coverage of the situation in Myanmar and Bangkok if you are just [[02:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10573.14s)]
*  joining us we can tell you that there was a 7.7 earthquake which shook the region for hundreds of [[02:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10594.42s)]
*  miles. 10 kilometers doesn't it to a layman like me it sounds quite deep but actually in geological [[02:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10603.06s)]
*  terms that is that is pretty shallow and you'll see from the build the pictures we're looking at [[02:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10609.86s)]
*  at the moment these are in central Bangkok this is the multi-story building that was under [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10614.1s)]
*  construction that is what is left it is now bathed in light these are artificial lights [[02:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10619.86s)]
*  because the sun has gone down and you'll see there in the foreground the rescue workers [[02:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10626.900000000001s)]
*  assessing the scene from our correspondent who we've just spoken to they're around 60 [[02:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10631.460000000001s)]
*  60 people we think who are underneath that building but you can see how tricky that is [[02:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10638.74s)]
*  going to be to extract anybody from that alive it's a very difficult and serious situation. [[02:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10645.7s)]
*  Let's speak to Richard Dr Richard Luckett he's a seismologist at the British Geological Survey. [[02:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10652.02s)]
*  Daltar it's good to have you with us talk to me about an earthquake like this 7.7 magnitude at a [[02:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10658.66s)]
*  depth of 10 miles what does that mean to a seismologist like you? Well as you say it is [[02:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10665.380000000001s)]
*  pretty shallow in geological terms and in fact it has reached the surface because an earthquake [[02:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10672.9s)]
*  like this has is big which means that the fault that has moved is 200 kilometers long at the [[02:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10678.98s)]
*  longest point it's moved about five meters and in height it's come up from 10 kilometers down all [[02:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10686.82s)]
*  the way to the surface so it's a really large rock interface that has moved to cause an earthquake [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10693.859999999999s)]
*  this big. Right okay so what is happening in that part of the world to create an earthquake [[02:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10699.14s)]
*  of that magnitude? It's plate tectonics the India plate is shifting north it's actually what's [[02:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10705.06s)]
*  causing the Himalayas the India plate is piling into the Eurasian plate in China and pushing up [[02:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10712.82s)]
*  the Himalayas which are growing constantly and in this particular place the India plate is moving [[02:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10719.38s)]
*  north about five centimeters a year but to the east of it the plate in a different plate is not [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10725.46s)]
*  moving nearly as much so what you've got is the western part of the land moving more than the [[02:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10732.179999999998s)]
*  eastern chunk and you've got this massive fault right on that boundary. I know you're always [[02:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10738.9s)]
*  asked this question but what does it mean going forward in the days ahead? Can you predict at all [[02:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10746.98s)]
*  the size of the aftershocks and how many there might be? [[02:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10752.5s)]
*  Well no but you can forecast that there will be a lot of aftershocks many of them will be big enough [[02:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10757.3s)]
*  to be felt and some of them like the the first one the 6.4 will be damaging in their own right [[02:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10764.1s)]
*  they tend to drop off with size so you get the biggest aftershocks soon after the earthquake [[02:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10771.14s)]
*  as the days and the weeks go by the aftershocks will continue but in general they'll get smaller. [[02:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10777.3s)]
*  We're trying to put our finger on the scale of what we're dealing with here for someone who has [[02:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10783.539999999999s)]
*  vast experience of earthquakes what would you assess will be the damage across these three countries? [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10788.18s)]
*  Well certainly the damage in Myanmar will be big I mean [[02:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10795.3s)]
*  in Bangkok and you think that's a thousand kilometers away the actual earthquake was only [[03:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10800.42s)]
*  16 kilometers away from a city with 1.2 million people in. We think there's sort of maybe [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10810.98s)]
*  well over two million people within the area of maximum shaking so we can expect a lot of [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10818.58s)]
*  casualties I'm afraid. Right there are buildings in Bangkok that are built to withstand earthquakes [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10826.02s)]
*  does the integrity of these high-rise buildings depend on the type of earthquake that it is? [[03:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10832.34s)]
*  Not if it's engineered properly I mean if you go to Tokyo the skyscrapers there are built to [[03:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10839.54s)]
*  withstand very large earthquakes of a variety of different types. In general Bangkok that's not [[03:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10845.78s)]
*  the case just because they don't get very many earthquakes I mean it's not in an earthquake zone [[03:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10853.78s)]
*  so if you feel an earthquake in Bangkok it's very likely to be one in Myanmar so you know the [[03:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10859.060000000001s)]
*  earthquake is much further away from Bangkok and the engineering is not done in the same way there. [[03:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10866.5s)]
*  Dr Richard Lockett thank you very much for that that gives us some idea of what we're talking [[03:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10872.42s)]
*  about let's find out what it felt like we can speak to the BBC's Lindell Markwell who is in [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10876.74s)]
*  Bangkok near one of those collapsed buildings she's our senior producer in Bangkok where were [[03:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10882.26s)]
*  you at the time of the earthquake? I was at home and only on the first floor when the earthquake [[03:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10887.14s)]
*  hit and I actually just thought I was having a dizzy spell then I left my flat went downstairs [[03:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10894.82s)]
*  the ground floor has a pool in it and the water even on the ground floor pool was sloshing out of [[03:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10900.82s)]
*  it as we left the building we then started to see the high rises around us I saw at least two [[03:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10905.62s)]
*  buildings with pools on the top having water cascading down the side of the building as you've [[03:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10911.14s)]
*  probably seen in some of these pictures today but I've now come across the city it took me over an [[03:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10915.7s)]
*  hour on a motorbike weaving out in and out of traffic with sirens wailing and ambulances trying [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10922.02s)]
*  to get through much much thicker traffic mostly gridlock to be honest than we normally see in [[03:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10926.82s)]
*  Bangkok although it's a city of bad traffic and I've come across to the north west of the city to [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10931.54s)]
*  Chatterjack where this collapsed building is the Thai Prime Minister has been here this evening [[03:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10937.3s)]
*  she's at the site at the moment we understand she has said this is the site of the most severe [[03:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10943.699999999999s)]
*  damage in Bangkok and across the rest of the city they now say that the other high rises are safe [[03:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10948.66s)]
*  for people to return to and they haven't sustained as much damage as might have been concerned we [[03:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10954.259999999998s)]
*  might have been concerned about earlier. They've worked very quickly Lindell to get the the [[03:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10959.22s)]
*  artificial lighting in place before the sun went down but we're seeing in the foreground here [[03:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10963.38s)]
*  group of rescue workers standing and looking at the construction is it I mean it's just an [[03:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10968.42s)]
*  extraordinary pile of rubble is it is it at this moment a case of trying to find the the best way in? [[03:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10974.42s)]
*  I think so I think one of the problems they've had so far this afternoon is they didn't have [[03:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10984.179999999998s)]
*  the correct machinery down here to start the rescue process so we have seen in the last half [[03:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10988.34s)]
*  hour some of the diggers coming in they're waiting for some large cranes to start that process as [[03:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10993.380000000001s)]
*  well you know we have hundreds of firefighters medical staff they've set up a field hospital [[03:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=10998.02s)]
*  down here but they haven't been able to start moving things on the site yet I think they're [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11002.5s)]
*  hoping to do that imminently but we're still waiting for that to start. I know you're gathering [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11006.5s)]
*  for us Lindell so we'll let you go thank you very much for the moment for that we've had a little [[03:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11013.460000000001s)]
*  bit on the tectonic plates let's get some more our science reporter Esméan is here in the studio [[03:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11018.02s)]
*  with more detail hi. Hi Christian so behind me I've got this map from the US Geological Survey and [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11022.9s)]
*  they are the group that monitor earthquakes globally and first flagged this earthquake [[03:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11029.060000000001s)]
*  now the first one we know struck at about 6.30 6.20 GMT or around lunchtime local time and [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11033.060000000001s)]
*  that's that big orange dot here which I've now just highlighted blue but then 12 minutes later [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11040.26s)]
*  we got a series of aftershocks and there was another one just south of that first one which [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11045.3s)]
*  was also very significant and we had further north as well some more occurring now we've heard about [[03:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11049.619999999999s)]
*  tectonic plates so what are they effectively the earth's crust that upper layer of the earth is [[03:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11056.34s)]
*  split into lots of different plates and they are all moving past each other and that creates a lot [[03:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11061.859999999999s)]
*  of friction now the main plates in this area are the Eurasian plate which is up here and the Indian [[03:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11066.9s)]
*  plate and as they move a lot of stress builds up and that gets released as a lot of energy [[03:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11072.42s)]
*  in this case there is a major fault the Segei fault which is more than a thousand kilometers [[03:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11077.460000000001s)]
*  long running very close to here where we think at this time maybe a lot of that energy has been [[03:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11082.82s)]
*  released now we know it's a 7.7 earthquake what does that mean effectively that is the amount of [[03:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11088.18s)]
*  movement along those plates and this is huge I mean we've heard already about the size of the [[03:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11093.94s)]
*  damage in Bangkok and that is a thousand kilometers south of here we're still waiting [[03:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11099.46s)]
*  to hear about the level of damage actually at the epicenter but the reason we're so concerned is [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11104.5s)]
*  that even though this area is very active we're actually concerned that it's a very shallow [[03:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11109.859999999999s)]
*  earthquake and that means that it was and that's why you got so much impact on other countries [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11127.38s)]
*  surrounding it as well so not only Myanmar but also Thailand China and Bangladesh as well so at [[03:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11134.74s)]
*  the moment we're still waiting for more information but it's not surprising that we had this earthquake [[03:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11141.619999999999s)]
*  but what is concerning is the sheer scale of the impact I'll hand back to you Kristen. [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11146.82s)]
*  Asma thank you very much it's really interesting to see that actually in visual terms I think it'll [[03:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11152.9s)]
*  give our viewers an idea of just how extensive things are in that region of south east Asia I'm [[03:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11156.9s)]
*  just looking at some of the pictures on our screens of these rescue workers going in and out of this [[03:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11165.46s)]
*  construction in in central Bangkok many of you will have seen on social media the the collapse [[03:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11169.94s)]
*  of that building there were quite a lot of cameras on it at the time with this crane on top and it [[03:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11176.34s)]
*  just imploded inwards with the crane collapsing into the rubble just in a pile of dust with [[03:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11182.18s)]
*  workers that were on the ground running in every direction but we think according to our correspondent [[03:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11189.220000000001s)]
*  there was 60 people unaccounted for beneath that rubble but how on earth through the night they [[03:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11195.06s)]
*  begin to get into that structure that is clearly a lot of the focus at the moment and it's going to [[03:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11201.380000000001s)]
*  be a very difficult task now I'm conscious that we focused an awful lot on Thailand so far but we [[03:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11207.62s)]
*  have Rebecca Heschke with us in the studio she's a former Asia editor we're going to get her [[03:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11215.220000000001s)]
*  thoughts after the break there is no one who knows Myanmar better I can tell you that so we'll get [[03:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11219.460000000001s)]
*  an impression of what the junta might be doing what the conditions in Myanmar might be like [[03:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11224.18s)]
*  and who is there to help them because it is rare in fact for the junta to ask for outside help that [[03:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11229.380000000001s)]
*  perhaps tells you of the size of and scale of things that they are dealing with there [[03:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11235.46s)]
*  plenty more to come do stay with us here on BBC News [[03:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11240.58s)]
*  you [[03:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11265.939999999999s)]
*  let's go to Tom Beeston who lives and works in Bangkok and joins us now Tom thank you very [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11286.019999999999s)]
*  much for your time here on BBC News can you describe what happened to you when the quake struck [[03:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11291.54s)]
*  yeah it was one of the weirdest things I've ever lived for each one of us we're on the 31st floor [[03:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11298.26s)]
*  of our co-working building I was with a friend and he kind of looked at me funny and said like oh I [[03:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11301.62s)]
*  think I've got vertigo and then suddenly everyone else around us started also you know looking at [[03:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11306.34s)]
*  each other and then people thankfully were with us and people who knew what they were doing they [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11311.54s)]
*  ducked straight under the desks and you have that moment where you don't really know what's [[03:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11315.460000000001s)]
*  happening then it suddenly clicks like oh this this is an earthquake so yeah we kind of got under [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11319.14s)]
*  our desk duck cover and then there was that weird period where because we were so high up we were [[03:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11323.859999999999s)]
*  like are we better off sheltering here or should we kind of try and get downstairs as quickly as [[03:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11328.019999999999s)]
*  possible so then before we knew it we were all rushing down the stairs as fast as we can with [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11332.18s)]
*  you know hundreds of other people around us and yeah it was uh it was chaos how long did the [[03:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11336.74s)]
*  tremor go on for and and and you say you were on the 31st floor what were the other people around [[03:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11342.42s)]
*  you like on that floor yeah I mean it was confusion and then a bit of panic and then just kind of [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11348.5s)]
*  trying to get yourself together to actually think about what to do but you know we could see the [[03:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11355.14s)]
*  building really felt like it was shaking we could also see across from us swimming pools and other [[03:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11361.46s)]
*  buildings were overflowing so then when you realize that an earthquake is actually happening it's [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11366.1s)]
*  okay we need to get ourselves downstairs but it's it was very confusing very panicky and uh yeah [[03:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11371.06s)]
*  so you ended up on the street outside how many other people were were there and what was their [[03:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11378.34s)]
*  reaction the other people there uh there was hundreds of hundreds of people the roads are all [[03:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11384.18s)]
*  gridlocked as well and it's gone there was mainly people on phones trying to fool family friends [[03:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11389.22s)]
*  kind of see what's going on see if everything's okay and again it's just you sometimes look at [[03:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11394.58s)]
*  people and kind of laugh because you don't know like what's just happened and what you've just [[03:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11398.9s)]
*  been through look at other people you just kind of have a disbelieved shock and uh yeah and have [[03:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11402.02s)]
*  how long have you lived in bangkok and have you ever witnessed anything like this before [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11408.74s)]
*  uh been in thailand for about 18 months now and no and it's one of those things where you never [[03:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11415.14s)]
*  think it can happen to you and that's why at the start there was such a period of not knowing what [[03:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11420.66s)]
*  was going on and i i have a thought oh this is an earthquake then a secondary thought of no it can't [[03:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11425.38s)]
*  be you know that that wouldn't happen here but then you bring out the six six that's in and [[03:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11430.82s)]
*  yes the first time i've ever experienced something like this you mentioned the swimming pools let me [[03:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11435.14s)]
*  show our audience if they're watching here on bbc news exactly what you were talking about so it's [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11440.5s)]
*  pulls on the top of these very tall apartment buildings and the strength of the shaking meant [[03:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11445.46s)]
*  that the water came over uh tom almost like a waterfall yeah i thought one building had like a [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11451.06s)]
*  burst pipe or something because from our angle it was just torrents and torrents of water coming [[03:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11458.02s)]
*  outside ways and what have the emergency services said have you had any messages about what you are [[03:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11462.58s)]
*  supposed to do or was it a case of the people who were outside a bit of common sense going on [[03:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11469.14s)]
*  yeah definitely a long period of staying outside not going you know back into buildings things [[03:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11474.58s)]
*  like that because aftershocks are common and for a long time after i think we were sat outside the [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11479.06s)]
*  building for a good 90 minutes just everyone just kind of sat there not really sure when to move or [[03:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11483.859999999999s)]
*  what to do and we walked uh we found we walked to go find like an outdoor area and there were closed [[03:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11488.98s)]
*  businesses with the staff kind of sitting outside everyone just kind of sat around talking and [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11493.859999999999s)]
*  it's definitely like an air of uncertainty of kind of when to go back to normal and how long [[03:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11498.18s)]
*  you kind of should wait in this kind of circumstance and [[03:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11502.18s)]
*  You [[03:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11509.46s)]
*  You [[03:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11510.46s)]
*  You [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11511.46s)]
*  so [[03:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11523.3s)]
*  So, as we've been discussing, the epicenter of this earthquake was in Myanmar. [[03:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11528.66s)]
*  To be honest, we're still trying to get a sense of the scale, which I'm not sure we're getting yet. [[03:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11558.58s)]
*  The internet is down, power lines are down, the Red Cross have already told us they are struggling to get around. [[03:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11563.14s)]
*  What we have been focusing on are the pictures of this bridge, the Ava Bridge. [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11568.5s)]
*  I'm not quite sure how it's pronounced, but it crosses one of the main rivers. [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11573.94s)]
*  This is the Sagai region, where some of the fiercest fighting has been concentrated. [[03:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11578.58s)]
*  There are 16 sections to that bridge. You can see most of them are in the Irawabu River now. [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11583.06s)]
*  So that is going to create real problems. [[03:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11587.78s)]
*  Although as we pan to the right there, you'll see a more modern bridge is still intact. [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11589.54s)]
*  With me in the studio is our former Asia editor, Rebecca Heschke, who's an expert on Myanmar [[03:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11595.7s)]
*  and the military junta that rules the country. [[03:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11601.62s)]
*  So let's begin, if we could please, with the political situation in the country and the fighting, [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11603.94s)]
*  because it was already a very difficult situation. [[03:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11609.94s)]
*  It was. This earthquake has hit Myanmar at possibly the worst time. [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11613.86s)]
*  For the last four years, Myanmar has been in the grips of a fierce civil war. [[03:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11618.74s)]
*  The Myanmar military sees power in a coup. [[03:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11623.380000000001s)]
*  There are now pro-democracy rebels who are fighting the military to try and over topple them, [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11626.66s)]
*  to bring a democratic government into power. [[03:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11632.1s)]
*  And the Sagai region, where this earthquake, the epicenter of this earthquake hit, [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11635.140000000001s)]
*  is a key battleground in that civil war. [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11639.86s)]
*  It's where we've seen some of the fiercest fighting between these pro-democracy groups [[03:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11643.46s)]
*  that call themselves the People's Defence Forces and the military. [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11647.619999999999s)]
*  So the military's been carrying out airstrikes in that area. [[03:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11651.22s)]
*  And also, we recently investigated who's now in control of Myanmar four years after the coup. [[03:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11654.82s)]
*  And particularly when you looked at Sagai, it was almost like a patchwork [[03:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11662.099999999999s)]
*  because the military no longer has full control of that region. [[03:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11666.259999999998s)]
*  There's different resistance groups. [[03:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11670.419999999998s)]
*  So that's going to be very key when we look at the relief and recovery area, [[03:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11672.18s)]
*  the recovery of this area after this devastating earthquake. [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11677.86s)]
*  We know them as the Tatmadaw, the junta. [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11681.220000000001s)]
*  There are some estimates that they only control around 20% of the country now, [[03:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11684.66s)]
*  largely the urban areas. [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11688.74s)]
*  Is it rare for them to invite outside help in? [[03:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11690.58s)]
*  Definitely. This plea for help is a sign of the serious situation that they're facing. [[03:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11694.26s)]
*  We see on your programme, we're seeing pictures coming out of Thailand, a detailed picture. [[03:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11699.62s)]
*  But in Myanmar, we're not getting that level of information. [[03:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11704.26s)]
*  And that's because the Tatmadaw, the military, [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11706.980000000001s)]
*  has effectively shut the country off from the outside world. [[03:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11709.86s)]
*  Foreign journalists are banned in the country. [[03:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11713.380000000001s)]
*  Independent media is effectively banned. [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11715.94s)]
*  Foreign aid groups are having to work through local partners. [[03:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11719.380000000001s)]
*  They're very, very isolated. [[03:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11722.42s)]
*  And that's how they operate. [[03:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11724.58s)]
*  So for them to say, yes, we need help, [[03:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11726.02s)]
*  is a huge admission of how serious the situation is in the country. [[03:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11728.9s)]
*  Who is in there? [[03:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11734.5s)]
*  I mean, what sort of agencies and organisations are able to offer immediate help? [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11735.380000000001s)]
*  Most of the big organisations, Red Cross, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11740.82s)]
*  other UN agencies, they're all working through local partners. [[03:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11745.78s)]
*  But they are already warning. [[03:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11750.1s)]
*  I mean, the United Nations just recently warned that the country [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11752.18s)]
*  is already facing a dire situation. [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11755.7s)]
*  They're saying a third of the country would need aid this year. [[03:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11758.5s)]
*  That's before the earthquake. [[03:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11762.26s)]
*  They're talking about three million people have been displaced [[03:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11763.86s)]
*  from their homes because of the civil war. [[03:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11767.7s)]
*  So all the aid agencies are now saying, [[03:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11770.1s)]
*  OK, the Tatmadaw, the junta has asked for help. [[03:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11773.300000000001s)]
*  That needs to be unrestricted access to the country. [[03:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11776.18s)]
*  That means foreign nationals being able to come in. [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11780.34s)]
*  The full force of what a normal aid operation looks like needs to happen. [[03:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11783.94s)]
*  That's unlikely. [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11788.9s)]
*  But as you've just described, that's not an easy situation. [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11789.62s)]
*  I mean, you've got tens of thousands, nearly a million people internally displaced [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11792.42s)]
*  and a civil war underway. [[03:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11796.5s)]
*  So to reach the more remote areas where they may need this aid [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11799.380000000001s)]
*  would be a brave endeavour for any agency. [[03:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11803.78s)]
*  It will be very difficult. [[03:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11806.02s)]
*  Also going back to that, who's in control? [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11807.619999999999s)]
*  I mean, the government doesn't have access to large areas. [[03:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11810.58s)]
*  We've spoken to me and my soldiers who say they're scared to leave their barracks [[03:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11814.019999999999s)]
*  in certain areas. [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11818.339999999998s)]
*  So even if the military wanted to roll out an aid relief program, [[03:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11819.38s)]
*  they would be restricted in doing that. [[03:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11824.339999999998s)]
*  People are just struggling with basic needs at the moment. [[03:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11827.779999999999s)]
*  There's a lack of coordinated control that will make this aid relief effort [[03:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11831.859999999999s)]
*  extremely difficult. [[03:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11836.9s)]
*  Fascinating. [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11839.3s)]
*  It's really good context. [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11840.02s)]
*  Rebecca, thank you for coming into the studio. [[03:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11841.38s)]
*  We'll keep in touch through the course of the day [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11842.98s)]
*  because plenty more news coming out of Myanmar. [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11845.3s)]
*  As I mentioned, it is a big earthquake. [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11860.58s)]
*  It's 7.7 on in terms of the magnitude. [[03:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11862.5s)]
*  And Dr. Brian Bapty is a seismologist at the British Geological Survey. [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11866.82s)]
*  He explained how serious a quake of that magnitude is. [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11872.02s)]
*  Quake. [[03:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11876.9s)]
*  It's capable of causing extreme damage close to the epicenter [[03:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11877.62s)]
*  and it's likely to have been felt further away. [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11882.42s)]
*  The city of Mandalay, which is the second largest city in Myanmar [[03:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11885.78s)]
*  and has a population of over a million, [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11888.9s)]
*  was only about 17 kilometres away from the epicenter. [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11891.14s)]
*  So it seems likely that there'll be significant damage and fatalities there. [[03:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11895.14s)]
*  And just to explain, we also heard that it was what's known as a shallow earthquake. [[03:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11900.34s)]
*  Explain what that is and the significance of that. [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11905.539999999999s)]
*  So earthquakes occur at a range of depths throughout the Earth's crust and deeper. [[03:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11909.94s)]
*  But in this particular region of the Burmese arc, if you like, [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11915.22s)]
*  earthquakes are generally quite shallow. [[03:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11919.46s)]
*  We think that this earthquake occurred on a kind of major fault system [[03:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11922.42s)]
*  that marks the plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian or Tsunder plates [[03:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11926.34s)]
*  and earthquakes that are typically at depths of less than 20 kilometres. [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11932.099999999999s)]
*  So you mentioned the plates. [[03:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11936.74s)]
*  Just explain how many are in that area. [[03:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11939.38s)]
*  And the basics of how an earthquake would happen with those plates. [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11942.58s)]
*  So the outer shell of the Earth is made up of all these different segments. [[03:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11948.26s)]
*  And those segments are moving around. [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11953.3s)]
*  Now they're moving pretty slowly, maybe a few centimetres a year. [[03:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11955.14s)]
*  But as they collide with and move past each other, that generates incredible forces. [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11958.82s)]
*  And over time, those forces build up in the form of strain. [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11963.78s)]
*  And eventually some of that strain needs to be accommodated, [[03:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11967.22s)]
*  either in the form of deformation or in the form of slip on earthquake faults. [[03:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11970.74s)]
*  And when the rocks on either side of those faults slide past each other, [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11976.26s)]
*  and in a magnitude 7.7, we'd expect the kind of rupture to move several metres. [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11980.1s)]
*  And that releases huge amounts of energy. [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11985.22s)]
*  And that causes the shaking that people feel at the surface. [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11987.3s)]
*  And we had the initial earthquake, but then a second one of 6.4, slightly after. [[03:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=11991.3s)]
*  Is that classed as an aftershock or is it a separate earthquake? [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12000.1s)]
*  No, that would be classed as an aftershock. [[03:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12005.140000000001s)]
*  Large earthquakes, and in fact, most earthquakes are followed by aftershocks. [[03:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12007.380000000001s)]
*  Those aftershocks occur because of the kind of change in stress in the Earth's crust. [[03:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12012.5s)]
*  So some of that stress is accommodated in the form of these additional earthquakes, [[03:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12017.300000000001s)]
*  as stress is kind of transferred onto different parts of fault systems. [[03:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12021.380000000001s)]
*  And I assume there is now a concern that there will be further aftershocks. [[03:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12026.5s)]
*  How likely would that be? [[03:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12031.54s)]
*  I think that aftershocks are almost certain. [[03:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12034.34s)]
*  For a magnitude 7.7, the rule of thumb is that the largest aftershocks are likely to be [[03:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12037.380000000001s)]
*  round about magnitude 6.7. [[03:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12043.060000000001s)]
*  So that 6.4 that happened earlier this morning, [[03:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12045.060000000001s)]
*  that's probably close to being the kind of largest magnitude of aftershock we would expect. [[03:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12047.78s)]
*  The aftershocks typically decay quite quickly with time after the main shock, [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12052.82s)]
*  so the number will decrease rapidly after a few days or weeks. [[03:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12058.58s)]
*  But large earthquakes can still occur and those could still be a concern and could still cause [[03:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12063.3s)]
*  damage, especially to buildings that are already badly damaged. [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12068.66s)]
*  Just give us a sense of how prone Myanmar itself is to earthquakes. [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12073.14s)]
*  How many have there been in the past and have they been as big as this one? [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12078.18s)]
*  Yeah, so this is an area where the earthquake hazard is high and many large earthquakes have [[03:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12083.3s)]
*  occurred in the region. [[03:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12088.82s)]
*  In the last 100 years or so, there have been 14 earthquakes with a magnitude of 6 or above, [[03:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12090.5s)]
*  within 200 kilometres of the epicentre of today's earthquake. [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12096.98s)]
*  The largest of those had a magnitude of 7.6, so similar to today's earthquake, [[03:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12101.460000000001s)]
*  but it occurred in 1946, a little bit further north in the Saigang region. [[03:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12106.26s)]
*  There was also a magnitude 6.8 in 1956 that was quite close to Mandalay. [[03:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12111.38s)]
*  That did cause quite significant damage, but fortunately the number of casualties or the [[03:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12117.14s)]
*  number of reported casualties anyway was quite small. [[03:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12121.86s)]
*  And this is always the situation when there's an earthquake. [[03:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12124.98s)]
*  We get the initial report from the US Geological Survey and I know that you in the UK would have [[03:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12128.18s)]
*  monitoring as well. [[03:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12133.94s)]
*  It is always a bit later once we get to see the pictures and the authorities get there on the [[03:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12135.06s)]
*  scale of an earthquake. [[03:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12140.34s)]
*  I think the impact of an earthquake always unfolds with time as more information becomes [[03:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12144.26s)]
*  available. [[03:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12148.98s)]
*  At the moment we expect it to be devastating. [[03:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12149.78s)]
*  There is likely to be very significant damage and the fact that there's a large exposed population [[03:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12153.86s)]
*  living in vulnerable buildings close to where the shaking was strongest probably means there [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12160.1s)]
*  will be large numbers of fatalities. [[03:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12165.22s)]
*  And were you surprised by the fact that it has been felt so strongly a thousand kilometres away [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12166.98s)]
*  in the Thai capital? [[03:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12175.22s)]
*  I'm not surprised that it's felt. [[03:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12177.06s)]
*  I think that you might expect that, but I am a bit surprised that it's caused the collapse [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12179.06s)]
*  of the building that's been seen in those media clips. [[03:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12185.06s)]
*  Yes, because modern buildings are some of them. [[03:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12188.18s)]
*  We know that Thailand itself isn't particularly earthquake prone, but [[03:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12192.5s)]
*  there are when buildings are constructed people do think about things like that. [[03:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12196.58s)]
*  I would expect any large tower block or any large building even in areas that maybe aren't so prone [[03:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12201.7s)]
*  to earthquakes to have been designed with earthquakes in mind. [[03:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12208.58s)]
*  It seems that this building was actually under construction so I don't know what the exact [[03:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12213.380000000001s)]
*  situation was. [[03:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12217.300000000001s)]
*  Similarly, I don't know exactly what the planning regulations are in Thailand. [[03:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12218.820000000002s)]
*  Are you interested in the fact that it was felt very strongly in Thailand, but we're getting [[03:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12222.82s)]
*  less reports from Bangladesh, which is the other side? [[03:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12229.22s)]
*  Yes, that's possible because the earthquake occurred on this major fault system that I [[03:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12233.94s)]
*  mentioned and it runs north-south. [[03:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12240.26s)]
*  So it's possible that the shaking was somewhat larger to the south than to the west of the epicentre. [[03:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12243.06s)]
*  So that could be what's called a radiation effect. [[03:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12251.38s)]
*  Let's talk to another eyewitness. [[03:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12256.5s)]
*  This is Jonathan Hugen, who was on the eighth floor of his apartment block in Bangkok. [[03:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12257.94s)]
*  So not quite as high as the 31st floor, Jonathan, but just describe what happened to you when the [[03:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12262.66s)]
*  earthquake hit. [[03:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12268.02s)]
*  To be honest, I grew up in California and Hawaii and I've kind of experienced earthquakes before, [[03:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12271.22s)]
*  so it was kind of a deja vu feeling. [[03:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12277.7s)]
*  I've been in Thailand 12 years and never experienced anything like it here. [[03:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12280.820000000002s)]
*  And I just kind of like, wow, I've felt this before. [[03:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12285.86s)]
*  And then the initial shock of being in an earthquake kind of wore out. [[03:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12289.220000000001s)]
*  I was like, oh, this is an earthquake. [[03:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12294.58s)]
*  So in the building I was in, it was pretty substantial. [[03:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12296.1s)]
*  I mean, it really did shake this place and it lasted. [[03:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12303.140000000001s)]
*  It felt like an eternity, but it probably lasted a good 30 seconds to a minute. [[03:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12307.619999999999s)]
*  And it was pretty scary, to be honest with you. [[03:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12311.3s)]
*  I haven't felt that in a long time. [[03:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12315.7s)]
*  I was going to say, if you've grown up in California, of course, you are alert to earthquakes, [[03:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12317.14s)]
*  but that's not necessarily the case for people who live in Thailand. [[03:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12322.26s)]
*  No, I could instantly hear the screams from my neighbours. [[03:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12327.22s)]
*  Like the whole building just erupted in a frantic screaming. [[03:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12330.9s)]
*  And I was like, oh, OK. [[03:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12334.9s)]
*  All right, I've been through this before, no big deal. [[03:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12337.86s)]
*  I'm an old hat, so to speak. [[03:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12339.54s)]
*  And yeah, the Thais, they're not used to this at all. [[03:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12341.22s)]
*  This was a very traumatic experience, to say the least, for them. [[03:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12345.78s)]
*  And what was the mood amongst the other people when you got out on the street? [[03:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12350.42s)]
*  I guess I'm a knucklehead because I just stayed in my room. [[03:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12357.3s)]
*  And then I had my fiance call me and said, there's going to be an aftershock. [[03:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12360.74s)]
*  You need to get out. [[03:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12364.02s)]
*  And I was like, OK. [[03:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12365.220000000001s)]
*  So I grabbed my cash and I grabbed my passport and just some basic stuff. [[03:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12367.380000000001s)]
*  And I went downstairs. [[03:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12372.66s)]
*  And the Thais are very happy people. [[03:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12373.7s)]
*  That's one of the reasons I live here. [[03:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12377.62s)]
*  The country is a great country to live in. [[03:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12378.98s)]
*  And I've never seen the look of shock and of just utter, I mean, just the best way to describe it [[03:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12381.060000000001s)]
*  was shock. [[03:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12388.66s)]
*  I've never seen them with a blank expression. [[03:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12389.380000000001s)]
*  They're always smiling. [[03:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12391.060000000001s)]
*  They're always a very great culture here. [[03:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12392.1s)]
*  And I've just never seen them with that kind of blank, shocked expression on their face. [[03:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12395.460000000001s)]
*  They're scared. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12401.140000000001s)]
*  They're very scared, to be honest. [[03:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12401.78s)]
*  And what is the mood now? [[03:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12403.86s)]
*  We're a few hours now after the earthquake. [[03:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12405.460000000001s)]
*  Right now, it's still kind of a panic situation because my fiance works out at the airport. [[03:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12410.5s)]
*  And where she's at, it's just sirens. [[03:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12417.62s)]
*  I think out there got hit pretty hard. [[03:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12421.779999999999s)]
*  I'm on more of the Sukhumvit area, kind of the touristy area, I guess you could call it. [[03:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12423.539999999999s)]
*  And she's more out by the business side of it. [[03:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12427.699999999999s)]
*  I guess you'd call it Don Mung. [[03:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12430.74s)]
*  It's the airport out there. [[03:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12432.5s)]
*  And she sent me a video and it's just pure, like, everybody sitting on the ground and [[03:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12434.019999999999s)]
*  all you hear is sirens. [[03:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12438.98s)]
*  So that's not a good sign when you hear that. [[03:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12440.66s)]
*  But yeah, the overall feeling still right now, I can look out and most of the people [[03:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12444.5s)]
*  are still outside. [[03:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12448.74s)]
*  They're still pretty scared, to be honest with you. [[03:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12449.86s)]
*  So you're the hard man inside while they're outside. [[03:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12452.900000000001s)]
*  You know, like I said, I've been through this before. [[03:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12456.74s)]
*  And the building I'm in, I don't know if I'd be in the same situation if I was in a 30 or [[03:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12459.060000000001s)]
*  40 story building with, you know, like you just interviewed the last guy and those pools [[03:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12464.18s)]
*  were rocking. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12468.1s)]
*  I just got out of the swimming pool at my gym, which is an infinity pool, two hours ago. [[03:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12468.74s)]
*  And that would probably not have been good for me. [[03:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12473.220000000001s)]
*  I mean, after seeing some of those pools splashing over the edges, you know, [[03:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12475.220000000001s)]
*  yeah, I guess I dodged the bullet on that one. [[03:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12480.02s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much for describing your experience there in Bangkok. [[03:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12484.18s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[03:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12488.66s)]
*  Let's get a little bit more detail about where it struck and the details. [[03:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12490.34s)]
*  Our science reporter, Esme Stallard, is in the newsroom with more. [[03:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12493.7s)]
*  So Esme, talk us through what we know has happened. [[03:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12497.62s)]
*  So there was this 7.7 earthquake. [[03:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12501.54s)]
*  What do we mean by that? [[03:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12504.02s)]
*  That's a measure of momentum. [[03:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12505.060000000001s)]
*  Effectively, it's a measure of how much movement there has been in the top layer of the earth [[03:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12506.5s)]
*  and what size has moved. [[03:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12511.06s)]
*  So the Earth's crust is split into lots of different plates and they're all moving constantly. [[03:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12512.74s)]
*  And Myanmar is at the confluence of four of these plates. [[03:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12517.94s)]
*  And so it's a very tectonically active region. [[03:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12520.9s)]
*  So we had the main earthquake that occurred about 630 GMT around lunchtime local time. [[03:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12523.78s)]
*  And then there was a series of aftershocks, which then occurred, affecting the neighboring countries. [[03:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12529.86s)]
*  But I want to talk a little bit more about that tectonic plate movement that I mentioned. [[03:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12535.38s)]
*  I'm just going to show you this map here behind me, which is from the US Geological Survey. [[03:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12539.779999999999s)]
*  And the dot here, highlighted in blue, was that first initial earthquake that I mentioned. [[03:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12545.22s)]
*  But then what happens when you get that movement then settling is that you get then these aftershocks. [[03:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12550.74s)]
*  For example, there was another one here just south, just 10 minutes later, which occurred. [[03:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12555.779999999999s)]
*  Again, that was very significant. [[03:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12560.339999999998s)]
*  It was more than six on that same scale. [[03:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12562.019999999999s)]
*  Now, when I mentioned before those plates, what we can see here is we can see a major red line coming down close to where the earthquakes occurred. [[03:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12565.22s)]
*  That's a major fault line. [[03:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12572.98s)]
*  So that's where some of that movement is happening. [[03:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12574.58s)]
*  And the US Geological Survey says that the kind of conditions or characteristics of this earthquake suggest that maybe some of that movement was occurring along that fault line. [[03:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12576.9s)]
*  That's known as the Segei Fault and it's named after the area local to it. [[03:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12586.74s)]
*  And then either side, you've got here the Indian Plate and then over here the Eurasian Plate, and they're also moving. [[03:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12591.62s)]
*  And so this is why this area is very prone to earthquakes. [[03:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12597.78s)]
*  But the sheer scale of it is quite unusual. [[03:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12601.140000000001s)]
*  The reason that we think it was so significant is that this earthquake happened a very low area below the crust. [[03:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12604.02s)]
*  It was only 10 kilometers down. [[03:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12610.980000000001s)]
*  It's a very shallow earthquake. [[03:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12612.5s)]
*  And that means when you get a lot of that movement between the plates, it really has a big effect on the surface. [[03:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12614.580000000002s)]
*  In terms of can we look at previous earthquakes, can they indicate potentially the scale? [[03:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12620.74s)]
*  When we look at other earthquakes of this size, we have seen significant fatalities. [[03:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12625.619999999999s)]
*  And I think that is why it's such a concern for local authorities and rescue services at this time. [[03:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12630.42s)]
*  And there's also, you know, mentioned just there the concern about further aftershocks. [[03:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12636.42s)]
*  So we've seen some more. [[03:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12640.66s)]
*  Those are the other orange dots here occurring. [[03:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12642.1s)]
*  So there is still the risk at this time that there will be further earthquakes felt. [[03:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12644.26s)]
*  But you can understand considering the kind of surround in geology, why this occurred. [[03:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12648.9s)]
*  Jack, I understand you're still stuck on the road. [[03:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12653.539999999999s)]
*  Just describe what happened. [[03:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12656.98s)]
*  Well, yeah, I just left my office and I was driving to visit a client for a 2pm appointment. [[03:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12658.58s)]
*  And around about 1.30, initially I thought I had a puncture in a tire because the car was sort of shaking a little bit. [[03:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12665.14s)]
*  And immediately I thought to pull over to the left hand side and notice all of the other traffic on the road. [[03:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12671.94s)]
*  We're sort of driving quite haphazardly and slowing down, pulling in. [[03:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12677.619999999999s)]
*  And it was only when I pulled the car in and put the car stationary, I realized the car was still moving around a lot. [[03:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12682.18s)]
*  And it was immediately at that point that I knew it was an earthquake, which is strange because Bangkok doesn't really suffer from earthquakes. [[03:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12688.099999999999s)]
*  It's the first one I've ever experienced since living here more than 10 years. [[03:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12696.34s)]
*  And I think people were taken aback by it. [[03:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12700.74s)]
*  Nobody was prepared or planned or really knew how to respond to an earthquake. [[03:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12702.82s)]
*  As the traffic sort of eased a little, we tried to continue on and just seen the building collapse right to the left of us there, as you can see in the footage. [[03:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12711.46s)]
*  And we were just shocked. [[03:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12721.14s)]
*  I mean, as you can see by the footage, it's just raw footage taken by my girlfriend in the car at the time. [[03:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12722.58s)]
*  Everyone was just absolutely shocked and parked up the cars. [[03:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12728.18s)]
*  People got out of the cars just in fright, really. [[03:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12733.380000000001s)]
*  Didn't really know what to do or whether to just stop and wait on this elevated expressway, whether to continue on. [[03:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12737.140000000001s)]
*  And since then, it's just been absolute chaos. [[03:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12745.94s)]
*  I mean, all of the high rise condominiums, hotels, shopping malls, offices, everyone had been evacuated for safety reasons. [[03:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12748.900000000001s)]
*  And it's only around about now, I think, that they're letting people back into these buildings. [[03:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12758.42s)]
*  So all of these people outside in 38, 39 degree heat, obviously unprepared. [[03:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12762.26s)]
*  Some people didn't have shoes on when wearing tops or t-shirts, didn't even have time to grab their things from their office. [[03:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12766.820000000002s)]
*  And it's just been jammed on the road since then. [[03:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12774.820000000002s)]
*  We tried to turn around and head back to the office. [[03:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12776.900000000001s)]
*  That was from half past one. [[03:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12779.460000000001s)]
*  It's now half past six and I'm still not even 10 percent of the way back. [[03:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12780.5s)]
*  So, Jack, we have been showing those very dramatic pictures of the moment of the collapse which you witnessed. [[03:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12786.9s)]
*  And you're saying that it is chaos. [[03:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12793.7s)]
*  How far have you managed to get away from there in that traffic jam? [[03:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12795.460000000001s)]
*  Probably about three kilometres, four kilometres, right? [[03:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12800.9s)]
*  Three miles or so. [[03:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12803.300000000001s)]
*  And have you ever, you've been living there for a while, have you ever witnessed any form of earthquake or shock in the area? [[03:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12805.140000000001s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[03:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12813.86s)]
*  So for me, at first, you know, my immediate reaction wasn't, is it an earthquake? [[03:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12815.22s)]
*  That's why I thought it was the car. [[03:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12820.74s)]
*  But then when you're parked stationary and you realise everybody is also doing the same thing, you just know it's an earthquake. [[03:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12822.9s)]
*  And then I had a telephone call from my secretary saying, are you guys OK? [[03:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12830.74s)]
*  Is earthquake going on? [[03:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12835.7s)]
*  And what have you. [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12838.1s)]
*  So it was very, very shocking indeed. [[03:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12838.74s)]
*  And my immediate reaction was to think about the people in the construction site of that building that tragically collapsed. [[03:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12840.98s)]
*  I mean, it is an active construction site and you know that there's going to be people in there. [[03:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12849.539999999999s)]
*  Just to see that come down, you immediately know there's going to be casualties. [[03:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12855.699999999999s)]
*  And I think even the latest news now, there's still over 80 people unaccounted for. [[03:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12858.5s)]
*  Yes, we've been seeing the pictures from the scene of the emergency services there. [[03:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12863.22s)]
*  And as you as you've been saying, the traffic completely jammed in and around that area. [[03:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12868.1s)]
*  And as you mentioned, 81 people, the deputy prime minister saying trapped in the building. [[03:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12875.06s)]
*  What have the authorities been saying, particularly say on social media or has it just been a case of everyone's been using their common sense? [[03:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12879.94s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not 100 per cent sure because I've been behind the wheel most of the time. [[03:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12890.34s)]
*  I've only just swapped now to all this interview and my girlfriend's driving. [[03:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12893.380000000001s)]
*  So I haven't looked on social media much, but I have from what I have seen, [[03:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12896.98s)]
*  mostly a lot of people sharing their experiences, damage the buildings that they're living in or the offices that they work at, cracks in walls and things like this. [[03:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12902.98s)]
*  And I think there's been a lot of concern of people wondering if the building that they're residing in or working in is actually safe. [[03:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12910.66s)]
*  Because aside from a collapsed building, there's also damage to other buildings where you've got these sort of two or three apartment buildings that have sky bridges. [[03:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12917.46s)]
*  And stuff that have been detached or there's damage between the buildings. [[03:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12926.82s)]
*  So I think there's going to be some long term structural damage that needs to be assessed and properly fixed. [[03:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12930.66s)]
*  Fraser, you're a reporter in making there. [[03:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12937.46s)]
*  Just describe to us what the scene is there now as it's beginning to get dark in Bangkok. [[03:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12940.18s)]
*  Well, yeah, as you can see, the sun is setting on quite a monumental day in Bangkok. [[03:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12946.34s)]
*  There's lots of people still milling around. [[03:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12953.86s)]
*  I think a lot of people don't really know what to do. [[03:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12955.62s)]
*  Yeah, like I said earlier, I think that people in Bangkok are not really used to earthquakes. [[03:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12959.7s)]
*  And so actually having communication is coming through in dribs and drabs. [[03:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12965.140000000001s)]
*  And so there's a lot of people here. [[03:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12971.140000000001s)]
*  There's maybe a thousand people still in this park. [[03:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12972.660000000002s)]
*  But I did go out onto the streets about 20 minutes ago and Bangkok life seems to be resuming. [[03:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12974.740000000002s)]
*  We heard a little bit in what you filmed. [[03:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12981.859999999999s)]
*  Just describe the moment that the earthquake happened and what you felt. [[03:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12983.94s)]
*  Oh, well, there was there's that split second when we initially felt the tremor. [[03:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12990.34s)]
*  And you pause for a moment because you don't know how big this earthquake is going to be. [[03:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=12997.619999999999s)]
*  And I've been in a few earthquakes in different parts of the world, [[03:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13001.94s)]
*  but it was immediately clear that this was something big and something different. [[03:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13004.58s)]
*  And so panic set in pretty quickly. [[03:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13008.5s)]
*  Yeah, everyone just rushing to try and get out. [[03:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13013.460000000001s)]
*  I was on the third floor of a shopping mall. [[03:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13015.62s)]
*  I ended up running down an escalator the wrong way. [[03:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13018.66s)]
*  People obviously panicking and screaming. [[03:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13021.62s)]
*  And then we got out onto the street. [[03:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13023.38s)]
*  And because you're in Bangkok, the immediate thing to do is you look up [[03:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13025.62s)]
*  because there's so many skyscrapers around. [[03:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13028.74s)]
*  And yeah, it was building swaying debris. [[03:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13032.1s)]
*  And also there was a swimming pool nearby that was overflowing as well. [[03:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13036.34s)]
*  And so, yeah, it was it was pretty intense. [[03:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13040.82s)]
*  And Fraser, what was other people who obviously have come out onto the streets? [[03:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13044.34s)]
*  You've managed to speak to them. [[03:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13048.98s)]
*  What have they been saying to you? [[03:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13050.42s)]
*  Yeah, I spoke to three young guys from the UK who are here on holiday. [[03:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13053.22s)]
*  They were in a hotel nearby Sukhumvit Road, [[03:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13058.34s)]
*  which is one of the main tourist destination tourist areas in Bangkok. [[03:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13060.5s)]
*  Their hotel room, they said the plaster was falling off the walls. [[03:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13064.42s)]
*  The whole building was shaking. [[03:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13068.980000000001s)]
*  And so they just ran out as fast as they could. [[03:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13070.42s)]
*  But obviously they couldn't use the elevators. [[03:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13072.740000000002s)]
*  So they had to run down flights of stairs. [[03:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13075.060000000001s)]
*  I did actually also speak to a tourist from Myanmar in the park that I've been in. [[03:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13077.7s)]
*  He's here with his elderly family and he's devastated, of course, [[03:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13082.58s)]
*  just hearing the news coming out of out of his home country. [[03:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13086.34s)]
*  Absolutely. [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13090.26s)]
*  So you have said that some people are sort of deciding when to and if to go back into buildings. [[03:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13090.9s)]
*  I suppose the concern is if there are any aftershocks. [[03:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13097.38s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[03:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13101.619999999999s)]
*  I think that's what people are doing in this park. [[03:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13102.34s)]
*  You know, I don't know if you can see behind me, [[03:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13104.98s)]
*  but there's still a couple of thousand people in this park that I'm at. [[03:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13106.9s)]
*  From a personal sense, I guess it was lucky that I was so close to this park. [[03:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13111.94s)]
*  But so many people in Bangkok, you know, [[03:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13116.82s)]
*  there's just so many high rise buildings and there's very little open space like I'm currently [[03:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13118.9s)]
*  in just now. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13123.06s)]
*  So people are kind of seeking refuge, I guess. [[03:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13123.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just letting the day sink in and just hanging out here until they get more updates. [[03:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13128.26s)]
*  And I suppose as the night goes on, that will become [[03:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13134.58s)]
*  a bigger decision for people to make as it gets later. [[03:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13138.42s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. [[03:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13143.22s)]
*  I mean, there are not as many people as there was earlier today when I first arrived here. [[03:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13144.1s)]
*  There are still, yeah, quite a lot of people deciding to stay and wait on more news updates as they come. [[03:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13149.859999999999s)]
*  The Thai defence minister says 81 people are trapped beneath that rubble. [[03:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13157.06s)]
*  Three bodies have already been recovered from the site. [[03:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13160.74s)]
*  With us to begin our coverage, this is Panisa Emotshashi, a reporter for BBC Thai. [[03:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13165.3s)]
*  Thank you very much, Panisa, for being with us. [[03:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13170.26s)]
*  Tell us where you are as the sun starts to go down. [[03:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13172.5s)]
*  I'm sure there are plenty of anxious people in the city. [[03:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13176.26s)]
*  What does it feel like there? [[03:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13178.98s)]
*  Yeah, so let's begin with unscanning on the bridge that actually located near the collab building. [[03:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13181.460000000001s)]
*  If you can see behind me, this is more of the bird eye view into the building that collapsed. [[03:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13187.14s)]
*  You can see over there does supply of concrete from 30 story building that collapsed. [[03:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13192.58s)]
*  Next to that, you can see that it's about three story tall at the moment. [[03:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13198.58s)]
*  And rescue teams has been going inside since early in the afternoon. [[03:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13202.34s)]
*  We have felt the shakiness of the earthquake at around 1 p.m. Thai time. [[03:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13206.82s)]
*  And we already spoke BBC Thai and BBC already spoke to two of the worker who were actually in [[03:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13212.02s)]
*  that building at the time that there were earthquake and we feel the shaking net and [[03:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13219.06s)]
*  they were running for their life. [[03:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13223.78s)]
*  And as you already mentioned, at the top of that 30 story building construction, [[03:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13225.22s)]
*  there were cranes and one of the workers that survived from that collapse said that [[03:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13230.1s)]
*  the moment he feel the shakiness, he looked back and he saw the crane on the top of the building [[03:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13236.98s)]
*  was start shaking as well. [[03:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13242.42s)]
*  He was just running for his life. [[03:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13243.86s)]
*  And for a split moment, he thought he could make it. [[03:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13245.460000000001s)]
*  So that's where we are. [[03:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13248.18s)]
*  We've had a statement from the defence minister who says they've pulled three bodies from the side. [[03:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13251.380000000001s)]
*  Do they have the teams on location at the moment? [[03:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13257.859999999999s)]
*  And do they know about the other eight or so people that are trapped beneath it? [[03:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13261.06s)]
*  Yeah, so it has been reported that about 400 people were working on the sides and at the moment [[03:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13266.82s)]
*  about six in eye is still missing. [[03:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13272.5s)]
*  But you can see that the rescue team is still going because it's already sunset. [[03:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13275.619999999999s)]
*  And they've been setting light everywhere to try to make sure that their rescues have been. [[03:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13280.5s)]
*  I was. [[03:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13318.099999999999s)]
*  Hello, I'm Christian Fraser. [[03:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13345.859999999999s)]
*  Welcome to News Now. [[03:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13346.9s)]
*  A state of emergency is in place across an enormous swathe of Southeast Asia after a [[03:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13348.5s)]
*  powerful earthquake shook Myanmar, Thailand and parts of southwest China. [[03:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13353.94s)]
*  The main quake came during the early afternoon. [[03:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13359.22s)]
*  It was recorded at 7.7 magnitude and just six miles deep. [[03:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13361.22s)]
*  The epicenter was close to Myanmar's second city, Mandalay, but there were powerful tremors felt [[03:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13366.58s)]
*  some 600 miles away in the Thai capital Bangkok and far beyond. [[03:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13372.34s)]
*  10 minutes later, there was a strong aftershock of 6.4. [[03:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13377.46s)]
*  The reports of damage from Myanmar have been slow to emerge. [[03:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13382.5s)]
*  This is a country, of course, embroiled in a bitter civil war. [[03:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13385.699999999999s)]
*  But in the last hour, the ruling military have asked for international help, which is rare. [[03:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13389.14s)]
*  The Red Cross said there are downed power lines in the Mandalay and Sagaing regions. [[03:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13394.66s)]
*  We have seen videos and pictures of bridges collapsing, pagodas and temples destroyed. [[03:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13400.66s)]
*  And there are real concerns now about the safety of some of the key infrastructure, [[03:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13407.3s)]
*  including some of the important dams. [[03:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13412.02s)]
*  The pictures of the roads that you're looking at, which are buckled in many places around the [[03:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13415.38s)]
*  capital, Nyepado, will give you some idea of the force of this quake. [[03:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13421.46s)]
*  Major hospital in the capital has been declared a mass casualty area. [[03:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13426.74s)]
*  There are reports that some of the injured are having to be treated outdoors. [[03:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13431.22s)]
*  Big tremors too in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[03:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13436.82s)]
*  The Department of Disaster Prevention said the quake was felt in almost every region of the country. [[03:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13439.22s)]
*  Now, there are 17 million people in Bangkok and the surrounding suburbs, many of whom [[03:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13446.1s)]
*  live in high-rise apartments. [[03:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13451.619999999999s)]
*  The main focus though right now is a rescue effort at a construction site in central Bangkok. [[03:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13454.18s)]
*  There were pictures widely circulated on social media like this one of this multi-story building [[03:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13461.300000000001s)]
*  with a crane on top of it collapsing, as you can see, into a cloud of dust with workers running [[03:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13467.220000000001s)]
*  in every direction. [[03:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13474.18s)]
*  The Thai Defence Minister says 81 are trapped beneath that rubble. [[03:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13475.460000000001s)]
*  Three bodies have already been recovered from the site. [[03:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13480.02s)]
*  Penisa Aymircha is a reporter for BBC Thai. [[03:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13484.58s)]
*  She gave us this update from that district of Bangkok. [[03:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13487.460000000001s)]
*  I'm scanning on the bridge that actually located near the collapsed building. [[03:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13491.78s)]
*  If you can see behind me, this is more of the bird eye view into the buildings that collapsed. [[03:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13496.18s)]
*  You can see over there does supply of concrete from 30-story buildings that collapsed. [[03:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13501.62s)]
*  Next to that, you can see that it's about three story tall at the moment and rescue teams [[03:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13507.62s)]
*  has been going inside since early in the afternoon. [[03:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13512.58s)]
*  We have felt the shakiness of the earthquake at around 1 pm Thai time and we already spoke, [[03:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13515.94s)]
*  BBC Thai and BBC already spoke to two of the workers who were actually in that building [[03:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13522.5s)]
*  at the time that there were earthquake and we feel the shaking that and they were running [[03:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13529.38s)]
*  for their life. [[03:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13533.62s)]
*  And as you already mentioned, at the top of that 30-story building construction, there were a crane [[03:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13534.34s)]
*  and one of the workers that survived from that collapse said that the moment he felt the [[03:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13540.5s)]
*  shakiness, he looked back and he saw the crane on the top of the building was shaking as well. [[03:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13547.3s)]
*  He was just running for his life and for a split moment, he thought he could make it. [[03:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13552.98s)]
*  So that's where we are. [[03:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13557.3s)]
*  We've had a statement from the defence minister who says they've pulled three bodies from the site. [[03:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13560.5s)]
*  Do they have the teams on location at the moment and do they know about the other 80 or so people [[03:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13566.98s)]
*  that are trapped beneath it? [[03:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13573.3s)]
*  Yeah, so it has been reported that about 400 people were working on the site and at the moment, [[03:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13575.94s)]
*  about 69 is still missing. [[03:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13581.62s)]
*  But you can see that the rescue team is still going because it's already sunset and they've [[03:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13584.74s)]
*  been setting light everywhere to try to make sure that they're rescues. [[03:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13589.94s)]
*  Let's talk about the wider situation. [[03:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13593.22s)]
*  There is a state of emergency in place. [[03:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13597.779999999999s)]
*  What does that mean in real terms? [[03:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13600.099999999999s)]
*  What does that enable the government to do? [[03:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13601.38s)]
*  Basically, with Bangkok, the Bangkok governor is basically one of the main ones, but also [[03:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13604.74s)]
*  every department that related for the government trying to do this. [[03:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13609.779999999999s)]
*  And at the moment, we're sitting on the street that no particular ordinary car can walk by [[03:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13613.3s)]
*  because this street at the moment that led to the collapse of the collapsed building [[03:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13619.619999999999s)]
*  is already full of rescues and full of equipment to be used for this rescue team. [[03:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13623.94s)]
*  So this emergency is really actually helped workers and also helps rescue teams to make [[03:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13630.18s)]
*  sure that they can do their job especially. [[03:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13636.66s)]
*  So in terms of the critical infrastructure, the transport links, the roads, the power lines, [[03:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13640.42s)]
*  a lot of that information is still coming in. [[03:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13645.22s)]
*  They've not had many hours to get information from outside Bangkok, but do we have a more [[03:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13647.699999999999s)]
*  considered assessment of how far reaching the damage has been? [[03:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13653.06s)]
*  Yeah, so at the moment, we still have like internet and everything is still intact in [[03:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13659.3s)]
*  light. [[03:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13663.859999999999s)]
*  Apart from this big collapsed building, and that's went online because of a very horrific [[03:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13664.259999999998s)]
*  scenes that everybody can see, there are also some report as well. [[03:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13668.98s)]
*  There's some old buildings also have collapsed. [[03:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13672.5s)]
*  And also you can see some cracks. [[03:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13675.38s)]
*  A lot of medicines also show that their condominium or their apartment, especially those with [[03:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13677.3s)]
*  tyroses, disgusting cracks or windows start cracking down as well. [[03:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13682.58s)]
*  Because actually Thailand is really not familiar with this type of shakiness, with this type [[03:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13687.539999999999s)]
*  of earthquake. [[03:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13693.38s)]
*  This is one of the first time for many Thai, especially those living in Bangkok, to feeling [[03:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13694.259999999998s)]
*  this shakiness. [[03:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13699.699999999999s)]
*  I was on the ground. [[03:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13700.9s)]
*  I was at my house on the ground for the moment at 1pm when it started to shake. [[03:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13702.18s)]
*  And you start feeling this to the level I never felt before. [[03:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13707.300000000001s)]
*  Panisa Amadshah there describing the situation around that construction site. [[03:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13712.42s)]
*  There is a state of emergency in place now in Bangkok. [[03:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13716.98s)]
*  We can show you some live pictures of the Prime Minister, Pithong Thai, seeing for herself [[03:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13721.06s)]
*  the rescue effort that's underway. [[03:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13726.82s)]
*  She's only been in office actually six or seven months. [[03:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13728.26s)]
*  An enormous challenge for her and her young government. [[03:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13730.5s)]
*  This is of course the scene in Bangkok, but right across the country, every region felt [[03:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13734.18s)]
*  the tremors. [[03:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13739.78s)]
*  So they will be making an urgent assessment of infrastructure and buildings down right [[03:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13740.42s)]
*  across the country. [[03:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13745.86s)]
*  But for now, the national focus seems very much to be on this side of this multi-storey [[03:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13746.74s)]
*  building which came down just after lunchtime with the crane on top of it. [[03:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13751.86s)]
*  You can see that in the last few minutes that rescue team which was in the foreground [[03:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13756.5s)]
*  has now moved further into the site looking for… [[03:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13760.82s)]
*  The numbers are a bit vague, but we think around 81 people. [[03:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13765.86s)]
*  There have been varying numbers that have come out over the last few hours. [[03:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13769.14s)]
*  As you were hearing from our correspondent, there are 400 people that were around the [[03:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13773.38s)]
*  site or were 400 people around the site when it came down. [[03:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13778.74s)]
*  And we've seen them running in all directions. [[03:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13781.94s)]
*  But the big question is how do you get into something like that under artificial light? [[03:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13785.06s)]
*  Because the sun has gone down. [[03:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13789.78s)]
*  You can see it's a mangled pile of rubble. [[03:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13791.46s)]
*  And beginning that process of locating the people that were trapped underneath it is [[03:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13794.98s)]
*  not going to be very easy at all. [[03:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13800.82s)]
*  So that process underway and you would think that will be going on for many hours, possibly [[03:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13803.62s)]
*  days to come. [[03:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13808.82s)]
*  We'll continue to watch that. [[03:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13810.34s)]
*  Now, in the hours after the main quake struck Myanmar, we didn't get much, but there is [[03:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13811.86s)]
*  a little bit more in terms of video and images that's emerged in the last hour or so. [[03:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13818.42s)]
*  Much of it shared on social media from there in Myanmar and from surrounding countries. [[03:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13823.54s)]
*  The BBC Verify team have been having a look at them. [[03:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13829.78s)]
*  Jake Horton can give us his assessment of what he's seen. [[03:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13832.82s)]
*  At BBC Verify, we've been examining dozens of videos posted on social media in the aftermath [[03:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13837.06s)]
*  of the earthquake. [[03:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13842.26s)]
*  One of the biggest challenges is that Myanmar, where the earthquake struck, has limited internet [[03:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13843.220000000001s)]
*  access, even in normal times, due to restrictions by the ruling military government there. [[03:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13847.54s)]
*  But we have managed to verify some video near the epicentre in the city of Sagayin. [[03:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13852.18s)]
*  This is one of them, where you can see a bridge which has collapsed into a river on the outskirts [[03:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13857.140000000001s)]
*  of the city. [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13862.18s)]
*  You can see several sections of that bridge have collapsed into the river here. [[03:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13862.9s)]
*  And another bridge is still standing next to it though. [[03:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13866.42s)]
*  This is another video that we verified from Mandalay International Airport, about 17 kilometres [[03:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13869.859999999999s)]
*  from the epicentre. [[03:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13874.58s)]
*  Dozens of people are seen crouching on the tarmac as they are ordered to take cover. [[03:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13875.779999999999s)]
*  We verified this video by matching the distinctive triangular structures on that roof and the [[03:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13880.02s)]
*  signs on the roof to previous images of the same airport. [[03:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13884.5s)]
*  We've also checked and the first version we could find was from this morning. [[03:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13887.859999999999s)]
*  People in the city of Mandalay have also been sending images to BBC's Burmese service, [[03:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13892.1s)]
*  which we've also verified. [[03:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13896.740000000002s)]
*  Another image here, you can see a collapsed building and rubble on the pavements there. [[03:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13898.740000000002s)]
*  And the tremors haven't just been felt in Myanmar, they've also been felt in Thailand, [[03:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13903.380000000001s)]
*  which is more than a thousand kilometres away. [[03:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13907.94s)]
*  This is a video from the capital of Bangkok. [[03:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13910.18s)]
*  We verified the location of this high-rise building, which is under construction in the [[03:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13912.740000000002s)]
*  north east of the capital. [[03:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13916.660000000002s)]
*  And this is footage of the same building collapsing from up close as construction workers [[03:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13918.66s)]
*  there run to take cover. [[03:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13923.220000000001s)]
*  The authorities in Thailand believe dozens of workers are missing at the site. [[03:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13924.980000000001s)]
*  At BBC Verify, we'll continue to go through video to bring you a better picture of what [[03:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13928.66s)]
*  is happening on the ground. [[03:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13932.82s)]
*  Thanks to Jake for that. [[03:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13934.980000000001s)]
*  Let's get some eyewitness idea of what went on at the time. [[03:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13936.18s)]
*  We can speak to Travis Leon. [[03:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13940.980000000001s)]
*  He's a content creator from Ireland who is based in Thailand. [[03:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13942.26s)]
*  He was up on the 40th floor of his apartment block when the earthquake hit. [[03:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13945.86s)]
*  Goodness me, that must have been scary. [[03:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13950.66s)]
*  Yeah, it was absolutely terrifying. [[03:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13954.1s)]
*  I think most people like myself thought they were having vertigo when this occurred. [[03:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13956.58s)]
*  I was sitting at my desk as I normally do work in the morning time and my chair started [[03:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13961.220000000001s)]
*  to swivel. [[03:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13966.82s)]
*  So I thought I was experiencing vertigo and I stood up and then my balcony door slid open. [[03:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13967.7s)]
*  That's when I went outside to the balcony and had a good peek and I could see all the [[03:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13973.06s)]
*  water from the rooftop pool sloshing back and forth. [[03:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13976.74s)]
*  It was a real run for your life kind of moment. [[03:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13980.1s)]
*  I've never experienced anything like that. [[03:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13982.66s)]
*  When you say it was a run for your life moment, how did you get out? [[03:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13985.06s)]
*  Well, I'm up on the 40th floor and, you know, having seen movies, I just know the elevator [[03:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13992.1s)]
*  is a no-go. [[03:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13997.54s)]
*  So I know there's an emergency staircase. [[03:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=13998.26s)]
*  And yeah, it took me quite a minute to actually realize what was going on. [[03:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14000.9s)]
*  I've never experienced an earthquake in my life. [[03:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14004.98s)]
*  They're not very common here in Thailand either. [[03:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14006.9s)]
*  So it was kind of the last thing that I thought was happening. [[03:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14008.82s)]
*  But once I did realize, I ran outside my apartment barefoot and I got into the emergency [[03:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14012.26s)]
*  stairwell and I made my way down 40 floors and that took about 15, 20 minutes. [[03:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14017.86s)]
*  Everyone was panicking, running past me. [[03:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14023.78s)]
*  Cracks were appearing down the side of the walls. [[03:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14025.94s)]
*  It was surreal. [[03:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14029.46s)]
*  But yeah, we made it down and everyone was, you know, situated outside the condo. [[03:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14031.06s)]
*  Because presumably it's an earthquake-proof building. [[03:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14036.9s)]
*  Was it shaking? [[03:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14039.46s)]
*  Was it swaying at the time you were running down the stairs? [[03:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14040.18s)]
*  It was absolutely swaying. [[03:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14043.94s)]
*  Yeah, that was the most crazy part about it because it was a sensation that you really [[03:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14045.22s)]
*  not used to feeling, especially on a high-up building, the whole building moving back and [[03:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14052.98s)]
*  forth. [[03:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14057.7s)]
*  And when I really realized this was happening was when I went out to the balcony and I was [[03:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14058.02s)]
*  moving forward. [[03:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14062.42s)]
*  It's a big drop down below. [[03:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14063.220000000001s)]
*  You can see all the way down. [[03:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14064.42s)]
*  You know, everyone looks like little Lego characters. [[03:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14065.94s)]
*  And once you look over and you could feel it going forward, I knew straight away I had [[03:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14068.5s)]
*  to get out of there. [[03:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14074.26s)]
*  Goodness me. [[03:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14074.980000000001s)]
*  So you get outside onto the street. [[03:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14076.34s)]
*  We're trying still to piece together the extent of the damage. [[03:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14078.66s)]
*  What have you seen as you've walked around the city? [[03:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14082.42s)]
*  Yeah, so I didn't go too far from my condo, but I made it out to the street and instantly [[03:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14084.98s)]
*  I knew what was going on, especially when I saw everyone running past me on the stairs. [[03:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14090.9s)]
*  There were people who were running in panics. [[03:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14094.58s)]
*  This has not happened to this magnitude in Thailand before. [[03:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14098.5s)]
*  So absolutely no one was expecting it. [[03:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14102.5s)]
*  But yeah, everything was built up in traffic. [[03:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14105.3s)]
*  What I did witness and I put in my TikTok video was as I was recording the video, something [[03:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14108.5s)]
*  fell from the building beside me and everyone ran screaming down the street. [[03:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14113.859999999999s)]
*  Once I got on social media, I saw the horrific scenes of buildings just completely collapsing. [[03:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14118.66s)]
*  They looked like, you know, crumbled with nothing. [[03:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14124.5s)]
*  So that was quite tragic. [[03:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14129.38s)]
*  Yeah, that building in the northeast of the capital, which we've been looking at, [[03:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14131.859999999999s)]
*  yeah, appalling for the workers that were on that. [[03:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14135.46s)]
*  So it looks to me like you're back in the flat. [[03:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14137.699999999999s)]
*  I'm back. [[03:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14141.699999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we weren't allowed in for, it must have been about three or four hours. [[03:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14142.18s)]
*  We were all waiting for updates from the juristic building management. [[03:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14146.98s)]
*  And they were basically unaware of whether these aftershocks were coming or not, [[03:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14152.02s)]
*  how strong they would be. [[03:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14156.58s)]
*  So we had to wait for that. [[03:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14157.54s)]
*  And also they had to do the mandatory checks. [[03:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14159.06s)]
*  You know, is there any gas leaks? [[03:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14161.54s)]
*  Is the electric, you know, circuits OK? [[03:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14162.9s)]
*  All these kind of little things to ensure that the building's safe, because [[03:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14165.7s)]
*  as you probably know, Bangkok is full of these condos. [[03:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14169.38s)]
*  They're massive and they're filled with hundreds of people. [[03:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14171.7s)]
*  So yeah, obviously we had to make sure they were fine. [[03:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14173.7s)]
*  But eventually we got back in. [[03:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14176.42s)]
*  The lifts still do not work. [[03:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14178.18s)]
*  Is the power back up? [[03:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14179.62s)]
*  The power's not back up. [[03:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14180.58s)]
*  No, I thought you were in the dark. [[03:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14183.22s)]
*  I didn't know whether you were doing it for effect, but I guess that the power wasn't on. [[03:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14184.82s)]
*  So I mean, you're a long way up. [[03:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14190.82s)]
*  Are you feeling a bit anxious? [[03:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14194.1s)]
*  Not anymore. [[03:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14196.98s)]
*  Not anymore. [[03:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14197.7s)]
*  I mean, God, there could be after tremors. [[03:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14198.42s)]
*  But from what I've seen online, they've already happened in their [[03:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14200.740000000002s)]
*  appointment in school now. [[03:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14203.86s)]
*  What I've read again online is they can occur within weeks or months after. [[03:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14205.380000000001s)]
*  I don't know if this is a new thing we have to get used to now, [[03:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14210.26s)]
*  but it certainly is made apartment with a nice view. [[03:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14212.58s)]
*  Well, I'm glad you got out safely. [[03:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14218.02s)]
*  And it's really good of you to come and talk to us after such a day. [[03:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14220.26s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[03:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14224.1s)]
*  Sleep well. [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14225.300000000001s)]
*  I was going to sleep very well tonight. [[03:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14225.94s)]
*  We've got a couple of cans here, so we're going to relax with our candlelight here. [[03:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14228.9s)]
*  Right, so you're well equipped. [[03:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14236.66s)]
*  Very good. [[03:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14238.18s)]
*  Travis, it's good to talk to you. [[03:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14240.5s)]
*  Thank you for coming on the program. [[03:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14241.7s)]
*  Lovely. [[03:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14242.82s)]
*  Let's get a view, shall we, from our senior producer in Bangkok, Lindell Markwell. [[03:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14244.5s)]
*  You have to smile sometimes, don't you? [[03:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14249.7s)]
*  But it's a really serious situation for a lot of people across the city, [[03:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14251.060000000001s)]
*  particularly the families of the workers in that building, [[03:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14254.26s)]
*  which you can see behind Lindell there. [[03:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14258.42s)]
*  We've just seen pictures, Lindell, of the Prime Minister on location taking a view. [[03:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14260.42s)]
*  Do they have everything they need there to begin that rescue operation? [[03:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14267.06s)]
*  They're still working by the sounds of it to get everything here that they need. [[03:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14273.94s)]
*  We've seen in the last couple of hours some diggers arriving, [[03:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14277.7s)]
*  some much more heavy machinery. [[03:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14280.26s)]
*  At first we were just seeing fire trucks, medical professionals, [[03:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14281.7s)]
*  a field hospital being set up, but now we're seeing on the site they've got a few diggers. [[03:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14285.86s)]
*  They're waiting for some cranes. [[03:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14290.1s)]
*  We've also seen they've been using drones to survey the site. [[03:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14292.820000000002s)]
*  There have been some dogs arriving, some sniffer dogs. [[03:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14295.54s)]
*  So they're getting ready. [[03:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14298.740000000002s)]
*  They've set up floodlights, as you can see, across the site [[03:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14299.94s)]
*  so that they can work through the night here. [[03:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14303.460000000001s)]
*  I was just mentioning to our viewers that she's not been in office very long, [[03:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14305.54s)]
*  six or seven months. [[03:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14309.94s)]
*  It's a big challenge for her because this has been felt right across the country. [[03:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14311.7s)]
*  There will be people who need help. [[03:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14315.380000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a huge challenge when an earthquake strikes any country. [[03:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14320.34s)]
*  And obviously they'll be looking to Myanmar as well. [[03:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14323.94s)]
*  And the huge destruction that we understand has taken place there today [[03:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14326.18s)]
*  and looking to how they can help their neighbour, I'm sure, as well. [[03:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14330.18s)]
*  But I think one thing that she did make clear this evening [[03:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14332.980000000001s)]
*  is that she's spoken to engineers across the city. [[03:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14335.54s)]
*  And they believe that other tower blocks, other buildings across the city [[03:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14337.78s)]
*  have been able to withstand this level of earthquake. [[03:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14341.86s)]
*  And they are safe for people to return to their homes this evening. [[03:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14344.26s)]
*  So many people are now off the streets. [[03:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14347.460000000001s)]
*  They were waiting in the streets earlier. [[03:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14349.060000000001s)]
*  They're now returning to their buildings. [[03:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14350.26s)]
*  There is damage still. [[03:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14353.54s)]
*  And there will be a lot of repairs to be done across the city. [[03:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14354.42s)]
*  Obviously, not only with this situation here that they need to deal with imminently, [[03:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14357.060000000001s)]
*  but there will be other repairs that need to take place. [[03:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14361.300000000001s)]
*  And people will be concerned by some of the damage they've seen. [[03:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14363.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course they will. [[03:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14366.58s)]
*  I've been in one myself. [[03:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14367.78s)]
*  I know that it plays on your nerves. [[03:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14369.3s)]
*  You feel the anxiety, particularly at nightfall [[03:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14371.699999999999s)]
*  when you're thinking about going to bed. [[03:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14374.66s)]
*  Just remind us where you were and what you felt and how scary it was. [[03:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14376.82s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I was at home, fortunately, and I live on the first floor. [[03:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14383.3s)]
*  So I felt as though the room was swaying. [[03:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14386.66s)]
*  I actually thought I've not had lunch and maybe I'm a bit dizzy. [[03:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14390.5s)]
*  And then I started to think, well, maybe this is an earthquake. [[03:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14393.46s)]
*  I've never experienced one in Bangkok. [[03:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14395.619999999999s)]
*  I've been here over two years. [[03:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14397.38s)]
*  And my other colleagues here say it's incredibly rare. [[03:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14398.9s)]
*  This is the biggest they've felt in decades. [[04:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14401.38s)]
*  I went down to the ground floor where the pool on the ground floor was sloshing out water. [[04:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14404.26s)]
*  And then when I went outside of my building, [[04:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14408.74s)]
*  I could see the tower blocks around me with water cascading down, [[04:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14410.74s)]
*  more than two of them in the close surrounds to where I was. [[04:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14414.82s)]
*  It was a very strange feeling. [[04:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14419.38s)]
*  Lots of people very confused and trying to understand what was happening. [[04:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14421.38s)]
*  There was no warning of this earthquake as far as we were aware. [[04:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14426.5s)]
*  And in the hour afterwards, there was also concern about aftershocks. [[04:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14430.66s)]
*  I felt a very small one. [[04:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14434.74s)]
*  The bigger one we were concerned about didn't come. [[04:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14436.58s)]
*  But the traffic ended up, Bangkok is a very, very busy city. [[04:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14439.460000000001s)]
*  And the traffic's bad a lot of the time anyway. [[04:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14444.1s)]
*  But the traffic in the aftermath was gridlock. [[04:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14446.1s)]
*  And to get across the city, I was in the east of the city. [[04:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14448.98s)]
*  I've come to the northwest where this construction site is. [[04:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14451.460000000001s)]
*  It took a long time to get across the city. [[04:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14454.58s)]
*  The only way to do it was on a motorbike, really, to weave in and out the traffic. [[04:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14456.42s)]
*  There were sirens howling the whole time. [[04:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14459.46s)]
*  Emergency service vehicles trying to get across the city as well. [[04:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14462.42s)]
*  So it's been a very strange day for many people in Bangkok. [[04:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14465.7s)]
*  A very strange day for Thai people and for people in Myanmar as well. [[04:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14468.98s)]
*  But I'm very conscious as well that there are a lot of tourists, [[04:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14473.38s)]
*  a lot of Brits and Europeans who go to Thailand [[04:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14476.74s)]
*  and will be there for the Easter holidays perhaps. [[04:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14480.18s)]
*  And they might be watching us across Thailand. [[04:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14482.82s)]
*  Do they have reason to be concerned? [[04:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14485.22s)]
*  Has there been any advice put out to expats, [[04:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14486.98s)]
*  travelling people in the country, what they should do, [[04:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14490.34s)]
*  maybe who they should call? [[04:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14493.22s)]
*  And is there a problem with any infrastructure at the airports? [[04:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14494.9s)]
*  As far as we're aware in terms of the infrastructure, [[04:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14501.699999999999s)]
*  I mean within Bangkok, the MRT and the BTS, [[04:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14504.02s)]
*  which is the transport system, the train transport system across the city, [[04:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14507.539999999999s)]
*  that has been suspended, was suspended and remains suspended this evening. [[04:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14510.58s)]
*  And it's been very difficult moving around the city. [[04:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14516.02s)]
*  One of the airports there were delays at, [[04:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14517.94s)]
*  one of the airports was still functioning as far as we're aware. [[04:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14520.82s)]
*  Some of the roads were shut down, so it was harder to get around the city. [[04:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14523.22s)]
*  But we're not hearing about any injuries of expats. [[04:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14526.18s)]
*  We're not hearing of there being concerns more widely. [[04:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14529.3s)]
*  It's unclear when the transport system will be fully up and running again, [[04:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14533.86s)]
*  if people are trying to travel from one place to another. [[04:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14537.62s)]
*  Not all the flights have been taking off. [[04:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14540.66s)]
*  And also it was hard to get to an airport even if your flight was taking off. [[04:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14542.02s)]
*  There isn't a specific concern in Bangkok in terms of other people being injured at the moment. [[04:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14545.62s)]
*  And I think this is really our focus tonight in terms of the people across the city. [[04:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14550.5s)]
*  This is where everyone's focusing now tonight to hope these people are rescued. [[04:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14556.980000000001s)]
*  Linda Markwell, thank you very much indeed for that. [[04:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14561.7s)]
*  I am conscious that we're focusing a lot on Thailand, [[04:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14564.900000000001s)]
*  but that's where the information is coming from. [[04:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14567.54s)]
*  We're trying to get much more from Myanmar where [[04:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14569.380000000001s)]
*  there's a fair chance that this situation is much more serious. [[04:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14571.78s)]
*  A country already on its knees of course. [[04:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14574.820000000002s)]
*  We'll get to that shortly around the world and across the UK. [[04:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14577.380000000001s)]
*  You're watching BBC News. [[04:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14580.5s)]
*  Welcome back. [[04:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14627.54s)]
*  We are continuing to cover that enormous earthquake that has rocked Southeast Asia today. [[04:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14650.5s)]
*  Particularly we're focusing on the rescue effort that's underway in Bangkok. [[04:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14656.66s)]
*  In the northeast part of the city where this multi-story building came down [[04:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14661.460000000001s)]
*  while the tremors were shaking the city. [[04:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14667.38s)]
*  There was a crane on top of this building. [[04:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14670.18s)]
*  You can see that it's now just a heap of mangled wreckage with rescue workers trying [[04:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14672.58s)]
*  under artificial lights now to try and pick their way through that rubble to find or search for [[04:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14679.06s)]
*  we think around 80 people who are still missing. [[04:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14686.42s)]
*  They have pulled some bodies out of the site. [[04:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14689.78s)]
*  So around three bodies I think have been recovered so far. [[04:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14692.82s)]
*  They've had drones up tonight trying to get a broader idea of what they're facing there. [[04:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14696.26s)]
*  But clearly you can see from that it's going to be a very difficult and complex operation. [[04:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14701.86s)]
*  I said before the break that we wanted to focus on Myanmar where the military junta, [[04:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14708.18s)]
*  the Tatmadaw are fighting a civil war. [[04:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14712.42s)]
*  They do not control the entirety of the country. [[04:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14715.46s)]
*  In fact by some estimates they only control around 20% of it. [[04:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14717.619999999999s)]
*  So there are rural parts of Myanmar from which it's going to be very difficult to get information. [[04:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14721.779999999999s)]
*  But most certainly we'll need some sort of relief effort. [[04:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14727.06s)]
*  So let's speak to James Rodehevo. [[04:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14730.82s)]
*  He's the chief of the Myanmar team at the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner [[04:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14732.9s)]
*  for Human Rights. [[04:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14737.779999999999s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us. [[04:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14738.74s)]
*  Could you give me a broad picture first of all of what sort of help [[04:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14741.539999999999s)]
*  is currently in country in Myanmar? [[04:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14745.06s)]
*  Well, technically there should be a lot of help because you have a UN, [[04:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14749.3s)]
*  an entire team of UN humanitarian agencies that work in Myanmar and in theory have the [[04:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14755.06s)]
*  capacity to deliver the aid that millions of Myanmar citizens need as a result of this [[04:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14763.539999999999s)]
*  crisis that the military created. [[04:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14770.66s)]
*  Unfortunately, the humanitarians in the country have often been restricted in the areas that [[04:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14772.98s)]
*  they are allowed to go to and in their ability to get basic relief supplies out of customs [[04:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14779.06s)]
*  or out of the ports. [[04:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14787.779999999999s)]
*  And then whenever they actually try to deliver that aid, it's often stopped, it's often hindered. [[04:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14789.779999999999s)]
*  And so it's very difficult at times to get. [[04:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14797.46s)]
*  We are only, I think, getting an initial impression of the extent of the damage in Myanmar. [[04:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14799.78s)]
*  Someone who's just spoken to the BBC says, who was in Myanmar, says that they've seen [[04:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14806.58s)]
*  extensive damage around Mandalay. [[04:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14812.740000000002s)]
*  There are hospitals that have collapsed, pagodas that are down. [[04:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14814.900000000001s)]
*  How difficult will it be to sort of get an assessment of the damage and, as you say, [[04:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14818.58s)]
*  to get people into those more remote areas? [[04:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14825.220000000001s)]
*  Well, hopefully in cities like Mandalay, where some of the destruction has been the worst, [[04:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14829.86s)]
*  hopefully that will be slightly easier because those are areas where some humanitarian agencies [[04:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14834.1s)]
*  are already located. [[04:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14841.94s)]
*  So there should be some supplies closer to the points of need. [[04:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14843.140000000001s)]
*  But ensuring that first responders can actually get to those locations, that they'll be secure [[04:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14846.820000000002s)]
*  and that their protection can be guaranteed, things like that are what I guess still needs [[04:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14853.220000000001s)]
*  to be seen. [[04:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14859.14s)]
*  Then there's the broader area where the impacts of this earthquake have been felt in Sagaing [[04:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14860.18s)]
*  and in Shan State, areas where control of those areas is much less secure. [[04:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14867.14s)]
*  And that is part of the reason why some of this is extremely troubling because it's not [[04:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14874.9s)]
*  entirely clear that humanitarians will be able to get their supplies and their personnel [[04:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14881.539999999999s)]
*  to those areas. [[04:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14888.66s)]
*  James Rodehaver, thank you very much indeed for that. [[04:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14890.26s)]
*  We'll continue to keep an eye on the situation in Myanmar. [[04:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14893.54s)]
*  Plenty more to come on the earthquake coverage. [[04:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14896.66s)]
*  Do stay with us. [[04:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14899.460000000001s)]
*  You're watching BBC News. [[04:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=14900.34s)]
*  Let me bring you some of the latest pictures that we are getting from Myanmar. [[04:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15158.34s)]
*  Not easy because power lines are down, the internet is down in the country. [[04:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15177.7s)]
*  Some of these pictures shared on social media from neighbouring countries. [[04:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15182.98s)]
*  You'll see that a lot of the low-rise buildings are down. [[04:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15188.74s)]
*  The biggest damage is in Mandalay, which is the second biggest city. [[04:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15193.78s)]
*  It's a bit of a cultural hub, Mandalay. [[04:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15198.74s)]
*  There are a number of Buddhist monasteries there, pagodas, historical landmarks. [[04:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15201.86s)]
*  We've been told that some of those pagodas have collapsed as well as a hospital in the city. [[04:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15206.42s)]
*  And there you see some of the rescue teams picking their way through the rubble. [[04:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15212.1s)]
*  We've seen pictures of a bridge that is down over the neighbouring river. [[04:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15217.62s)]
*  But as our correspondent was telling me a little earlier, [[04:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15223.300000000001s)]
*  the Sagan region, which Mandalay is in, is involved, embroiled in the civil war. [[04:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15227.060000000001s)]
*  So outside the city in the more remote parts around Mandalay, access is quite difficult. [[04:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15233.86s)]
*  You see there some of the pagodas and the temples and the damage that has been left. [[04:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15241.3s)]
*  These are ancient structures, of course, which have been shucked to their foundations. [[04:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15246.9s)]
*  You would expect right across the country damage like this. [[04:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15251.46s)]
*  We've been hearing from the UN that they do have local teams that they work with on the ground, [[04:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15255.38s)]
*  but they need access through the junta. [[04:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15260.18s)]
*  That access has not been available in recent months and years. [[04:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15263.3s)]
*  So when they appeal for outside help, there will be governments looking for reassurance [[04:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15267.86s)]
*  from the junta that it will be access all areas and not just those areas which the military controls. [[04:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15273.7s)]
*  Let us speak to someone who was in Bangkok when the earthquake struck. [[04:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15283.94s)]
*  Zach Liu, he is an instructor at the World Study Centre in Bangkok. [[04:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15288.26s)]
*  Thank you very much, Zach, for being with us. [[04:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15293.78s)]
*  Tell us your experience. [[04:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15295.62s)]
*  Where were you? [[04:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15297.06s)]
*  I was actually walking around inside the shopping mall. [[04:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15299.46s)]
*  In fact, my school is located inside the shopping mall too. [[04:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15303.06s)]
*  And at that time, my family actually came to visit me. [[04:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15306.9s)]
*  And so we did not have any appointment. [[04:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15310.5s)]
*  I was talking to them. [[04:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15312.66s)]
*  We were sitting at a table and then all of a sudden I felt this vertigo. [[04:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15314.019999999999s)]
*  I thought I was having hypertension. [[04:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15319.22s)]
*  But in fact, you know, it turned out to be the earthquake. [[04:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15322.26s)]
*  I did not know anything about the earthquake at the moment. [[04:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15325.86s)]
*  But I saw lots and lots of people running for their lives. [[04:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15328.34s)]
*  And at first I thought it was actually a bomb or maybe a group of students fighting one another. [[04:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15332.820000000002s)]
*  That was just what happened only last week in Bangkok. [[04:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15339.78s)]
*  And so at the time, I decided to just take everyone in my family, my whole family, to try to get out. [[04:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15343.460000000001s)]
*  And what are you feeling now? [[04:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15353.7s)]
*  Where are you going to stay tonight? [[04:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15356.74s)]
*  How concerned are you about your family and where everybody is? [[04:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15358.820000000002s)]
*  To be honest, I'm not even home yet. [[04:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15363.62s)]
*  I also live in a condo, which is also a high-rise building. [[04:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15366.820000000002s)]
*  And that's why I'm not sure if I should really go back there at the moment. [[04:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15370.26s)]
*  I don't think it's the wise decision. [[04:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15374.66s)]
*  So I talked to my sister who lives nearby and I am hanging around in her home. [[04:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15376.02s)]
*  In fact, you know, my sister just came back to her home too. [[04:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15382.9s)]
*  The traffic outside is also very bad. [[04:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15387.619999999999s)]
*  It's really back to back. [[04:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15389.619999999999s)]
*  And in fact, you know, the last time I talked to my sister just now, [[04:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15391.06s)]
*  she said that she was on the road for about four hours. [[04:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15396.1s)]
*  And in fact, you know, it should have taken her only one hour to get back home. [[04:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15400.58s)]
*  The Prime Minister used to be not the construction site that collapsed. [[04:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15405.779999999999s)]
*  She said that the structural integrity of many of the buildings in Bangkok is sound, [[04:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15410.66s)]
*  which I guess is a credit to the things the authorities have put in place. [[04:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15416.1s)]
*  It's not a city that suffers a lot of tremors like this, [[04:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15421.3s)]
*  but the earthquake protection under the building seems to have worked. [[04:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15425.14s)]
*  In fact, the building that you probably see going on viral on the internet [[04:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15432.74s)]
*  is probably the one that is under construction. [[04:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15437.78s)]
*  And that's why it probably did not have any strong foundation. [[04:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15440.5s)]
*  Most buildings are probably OK, although I can't say that, [[04:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15444.58s)]
*  you know, for people living in very high-rise buildings. [[04:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15449.380000000001s)]
*  The one that I was in was actually a four-story shopping mall and that was still OK. [[04:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15453.140000000001s)]
*  But even that, you know, a lot of people started running for their lives [[04:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15460.02s)]
*  and we tried to get out of the building as quickly as possible. [[04:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15463.220000000001s)]
*  In fact, I parked my car in the basement and my first thought was actually to leave my car [[04:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15466.98s)]
*  like that. [[04:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15474.66s)]
*  But then luckily I parked just close to the street, [[04:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15475.06s)]
*  so I quickly got in and tried to get out as quickly as possible. [[04:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15479.539999999999s)]
*  Zaliu, thank you. [[04:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15485.3s)]
*  You have to say one thing. [[04:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15486.74s)]
*  Of course. [[04:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15487.619999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if you could say one thing, it would be much better if you could have this [[04:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15490.5s)]
*  warning system like in what they do in Korea or in Japan where if there is an earthquake, [[04:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15494.5s)]
*  then an SMS message can probably be sent to everyone just to warn people. [[04:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15500.66s)]
*  That's a very interesting point, actually, because I mean, [[04:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15505.22s)]
*  we're 20 years on from the tsunami, which I covered extensively, [[04:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15508.98s)]
*  and there were all sorts of preparations and things that were put, [[04:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15512.42s)]
*  you know, in the coastal areas. [[04:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15515.94s)]
*  Do you feel in Bangkok there should be an early warning system? [[04:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15517.78s)]
*  Of course, because we don't know what is going to happen. [[04:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15521.14s)]
*  And so if you can have a system like that installed, in fact, you know, [[04:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15524.18s)]
*  we can probably save a lot more people, don't you think? [[04:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15528.82s)]
*  I think it's a really good idea, particularly if you're in an earthquake area. [[04:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15531.78s)]
*  Yes. [[04:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15534.74s)]
*  Well, maybe the authorities will be listening, Zach, and we'll pay attention to that. [[04:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15535.14s)]
*  It usually forces change when something like this happens. [[04:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15538.66s)]
*  But thank you very much for coming on the program. [[04:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15541.86s)]
*  There'll be a lot of people wondering why Bangkok doesn't normally expand. [[04:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15544.9s)]
*  Normally experience things like this. [[04:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15550.18s)]
*  It is slightly outside the earthquake area. [[04:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15551.78s)]
*  But let's get more from Esme Stallard, who's here and could give us a broader idea of the map [[04:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15554.1s)]
*  and where Thailand is in relation to the plates, Esme. [[04:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15559.380000000001s)]
*  Exactly. [[04:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15563.94s)]
*  So if we just start from the beginning. [[04:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15564.42s)]
*  So we had this earthquake at 6.20 GMT around lunchtime, local time, [[04:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15566.02s)]
*  and it occurred here near Segei in Myanmar. [[04:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15571.54s)]
*  Now, that's a thousand kilometers away from Bangkok. [[04:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15574.82s)]
*  But this was such a big earthquake that it was felt as far away as that. [[04:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15577.38s)]
*  Now, I'm going to now show you some of the other aftershocks that happen. [[04:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15581.3s)]
*  So this is a map from the US Geological Survey. [[04:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15585.06s)]
*  So they are the US government science arm that monitors earthquakes. [[04:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15587.779999999999s)]
*  And there was this first one, that one that I mentioned there. [[04:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15591.939999999999s)]
*  But then later, just 12 minutes afterwards, there was another one just south of it, [[04:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15594.259999999998s)]
*  which is also very significant, and a series of other ones in the north. [[04:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15598.42s)]
*  Now, why are they occurring in this region? [[04:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15602.9s)]
*  Well, that's to do with the different plate boundaries that are here. [[04:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15605.22s)]
*  So the earth is covered in a crust, and that is split into lots of different plates. [[04:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15608.66s)]
*  And they're constantly moving past or below or above each other. [[04:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15612.82s)]
*  And sometimes when they get stuck, a lot of friction builds up, [[04:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15616.5s)]
*  and that gets released as a huge amount of energy in earthquakes. [[04:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15619.46s)]
*  Now, Myanmar is in a very active zone. [[04:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15622.82s)]
*  The Indian Plate is down here, the Eurasian Plate up here. [[04:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15625.779999999999s)]
*  They are colliding. [[04:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15628.66s)]
*  And then there is a big fault zone here, the Segei Fault. [[04:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15629.779999999999s)]
*  Now, friction, we think, has built up along that fault. [[04:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15633.7s)]
*  And as it got released, it created this earthquake. [[04:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15636.34s)]
*  Now, you can see on this map how far away Bangkok is. [[04:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15639.460000000001s)]
*  And that shows how big an earthquake it was. [[04:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15642.34s)]
*  The other thing we're quite concerned about is, [[04:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15645.060000000001s)]
*  even though we expect earthquakes in this area, it was very shallow. [[04:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15646.820000000002s)]
*  So it was only about 10 kilometres below the surface. [[04:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15650.34s)]
*  That means it can going to be felt quite significantly there. [[04:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15653.54s)]
*  The other thing, the reason we think it was felt so far away, [[04:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15656.820000000002s)]
*  is that this fault line is actually quite straight, [[04:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15659.62s)]
*  which means the energy can really travel down it to other countries. [[04:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15662.26s)]
*  Now, we haven't heard that much about what's actually happening on the ground in Myanmar. [[04:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15666.18s)]
*  Obviously, we know that's because some of the telegraph lines are down. [[04:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15670.5s)]
*  But I think we can take from what's happening in Bangkok [[04:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15673.78s)]
*  as evidence of how serious this is. [[04:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15676.18s)]
*  And the US Geological Survey, who I mentioned before, [[04:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15678.26s)]
*  said for an earthquake of this size, [[04:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15680.98s)]
*  we could be looking at deaths in excess of tens of thousands of people. [[04:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15683.22s)]
*  So it is quite concerning at the moment, Christian. [[04:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15687.62s)]
*  That's me. Yeah. [[04:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15689.7s)]
*  And you look at that map, you can see actually the proximity of southwest China, [[04:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15690.26s)]
*  which we've not talked about, and Laos as well. [[04:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15693.62s)]
*  Not much news from those areas at the moment, although we do know they are affected. [[04:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15695.78s)]
*  That's me. For the moment, thank you so much for that. [[04:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15699.14s)]
*  We'll bring you plenty more reaction and news from Southeast Asia as and when we get it. [[04:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15702.18s)]
*  But let's for a moment... [[04:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15706.82s)]
*  ...the filmmaker Mick O'Shea, he was eating in a cafe when the earthquake struck [[04:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15707.62s)]
*  and he rushed to help at a nearby hospital that was evacuating its patients. [[04:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15723.54s)]
*  I've seen some of those pictures, actually. [[04:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15728.58s)]
*  Where are you now? [[04:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15730.5s)]
*  And what can you tell us about the picture around you? [[04:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15732.1s)]
*  Yes, I'm actually in a part of the King's Royal Palace in downtown Bangkok, [[04:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15735.22s)]
*  which is attached to a hospital and they call the King Mongkut Hospital. [[04:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15739.14s)]
*  And I happened to be having a meal there when the earthquake hit. [[04:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15743.859999999999s)]
*  And like everyone else, I rushed outside and to try and get away from the high rise buildings, [[04:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15747.699999999999s)]
*  because there was actually masonry and bits of concrete falling off the high rises [[04:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15752.1s)]
*  and landing on the streets. [[04:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15756.1s)]
*  So me and a bunch of people run across the road to a park. [[04:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15757.619999999999s)]
*  And then I noticed that the hospital was being evacuated and it was quite chaotic [[04:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15760.42s)]
*  because they started bringing people out in wheelchairs and stretcher beds. [[04:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15764.42s)]
*  But then they must have run out of wheelchairs and stretcher beds. [[04:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15768.5s)]
*  They were carrying people out by their arms and legs and on people's backs. [[04:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15771.14s)]
*  So I ran in to try and help evacuate the hospital. [[04:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15774.42s)]
*  And I helped rescue one lady in a wheelchair get there outside into the park. [[04:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15777.54s)]
*  And I went back to get someone else and then the security wouldn't let me in. [[04:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15782.74s)]
*  But when I went back, I saw that there was a car parked on the road, [[04:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15786.82s)]
*  like where I was running back and forth. [[04:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15790.42s)]
*  And there was about like 200 kilos of concrete and masonry had landed on the car, [[04:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15792.26s)]
*  smashed all the front windows to the windscreen. [[04:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15797.539999999999s)]
*  The whole bonnet was smashed in. [[04:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15799.619999999999s)]
*  So it had obviously fallen from a great height. [[04:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15801.14s)]
*  And it was very clear that if anyone was in the way of that, they wouldn't survive. [[04:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15803.539999999999s)]
*  So it was quite intimidating to see that much stuff falling off the buildings. [[04:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15806.82s)]
*  I imagine so. [[04:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15811.94s)]
*  Have you been in an earthquake before? [[04:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15812.98s)]
*  I have actually. [[04:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15814.74s)]
*  Yeah, I was in a 7.9 Richter scale earthquake in Indonesia once before. [[04:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15815.38s)]
*  And I was right near the epicenter. [[04:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15819.3s)]
*  So that was a lot stronger. [[04:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15821.3s)]
*  But there wasn't a lot of high rises around there. [[04:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15822.66s)]
*  So I think actually I felt safer in the 7.9 right near the epicenter than I did today [[04:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15826.18s)]
*  in Bangkok because there's a lot of high rises around me with projectiles falling off. [[04:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15831.699999999999s)]
*  How long did it last? [[04:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15837.619999999999s)]
*  It lasted, I would say, about a week. [[04:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15840.34s)]
*  It lasted, I would say, at least a minute. [[04:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15843.22s)]
*  So it started when I was in this food court. [[04:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15846.1s)]
*  And I had time to get out of the food court, get across the street into the park, [[04:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15850.82s)]
*  and the things were still swaying. [[04:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15854.82s)]
*  I'd say at least a minute. [[04:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15856.82s)]
*  Yeah, I know this is a subjective question. [[04:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15858.26s)]
*  But it's difficult, I know, from where you are to give a sort of assessment. [[04:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15860.9s)]
*  But news drifts in quite slowly at the beginning of these sort of disasters. [[04:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15864.66s)]
*  Do you get a sense that we don't know the half of it at the moment? [[04:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15869.3s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[04:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15872.82s)]
*  Because like I can say, I walked past about four buildings between where [[04:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15873.86s)]
*  I kind of helped to evacuate the building to the park. [[04:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15878.980000000001s)]
*  And just along those four buildings, there was like hundreds of kilos. [[04:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15882.26s)]
*  And these were quite new buildings, hundreds of kilos of concrete that had fallen off [[04:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15886.66s)]
*  from great height and landed on the street. [[04:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15890.34s)]
*  And I assume, I can only assume that that's a similar circumstance all across the city. [[04:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15892.900000000001s)]
*  And this is a city of 17 million people with thousands of thousands of high rise [[04:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15897.86s)]
*  buildings. So I think it must be similar throughout the city, I assume. [[04:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15901.62s)]
*  And have you given thought as to where you'll go tonight, what you will do? [[04:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15906.980000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, can you repeat that? [[04:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15911.220000000001s)]
*  Have you given any thought as to where you'll go tonight and what you will do? [[04:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15912.34s)]
*  The first thing I'm going to do when I leave the hospital here and get back to my apartment is [[04:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15916.740000000002s)]
*  I'm going to do a bit of a structural assessment and figure out whether I want to sleep there [[04:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15920.5s)]
*  tonight. So I'm going to do a good walk around all of the car parks and the structural areas [[04:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15924.1s)]
*  that I can access and see if there's any cracks. [[04:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15928.740000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that sounds pretty sensible to me. And just in terms of the patients that were evacuated from [[04:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15931.3s)]
*  the hospital, have they been taken back in or are they now being treated outside? [[04:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15936.58s)]
*  So there's about 100 people in this room behind me and they are all the patients of the hospital. [[04:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15941.3s)]
*  There's over a thousand people evacuated. Most of them haven't been let back into the hospital [[04:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15946.5s)]
*  yet because it hasn't been cleared by the authorities as being structurally safe. [[04:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15951.14s)]
*  So they're actually going to spend the night here. And I know for a fact that there was two [[04:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15955.86s)]
*  people who had heart attacks just during the evacuation. So obviously there's a lot of risks [[04:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15959.94s)]
*  that come with these sorts of things that carry on after the initial event. So all these people [[04:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15964.980000000001s)]
*  that should be in ICUs tonight, they're actually in these makeshift rooms outside of hospitals. [[04:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15970.1s)]
*  A state of emergency has been declared across large parts of Myanmar after a powerful 7.7 magnitude [[04:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15975.86s)]
*  earthquake. Hundreds are feared to have died. The quake's epicentre was near Mandalay, home to [[04:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15982.58s)]
*  one and a half million people. Heavy shaking also reported in Bangkok, the capital of neighbouring [[04:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15988.66s)]
*  Thailand. And tremors were felt in parts of China, India, Bangladesh. Teams from the Red Cross are [[04:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=15994.58s)]
*  attempting to respond but facing challenges due to a lack of power in the affected areas. Well, [[04:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16000.9s)]
*  it's now just after eight o'clock at night there in Bangkok. These are the live pictures, workers [[04:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16006.98s)]
*  at the scene of one of the buildings that's collapsed. Graham Satchel has this. [[04:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16012.34s)]
*  All right. [[04:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16018.66s)]
*  The terrifying moments of building collapses in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[04:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16024.66s)]
*  Construction workers screaming and running for their lives. [[04:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16033.38s)]
*  The same moment was captured more than a mile away by a member of the public. [[04:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16042.18s)]
*  You can feel the panic and horror as people try to get away. [[04:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16045.46s)]
*  The high-rise building was reduced to rubble in just a few seconds. [[04:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16055.619999999999s)]
*  Emergency services were on the scene quickly to help the injured, but it's thought hundreds of [[04:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16059.859999999999s)]
*  workers were on the site when the building collapsed and dozens may be trapped in the wreckage. [[04:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16064.5s)]
*  The moment the earthquake struck was caught on camera in this Bangkok office. [[04:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16069.94s)]
*  You can see the building rocking backwards and forwards. [[04:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16077.220000000001s)]
*  Almost immediately, every office block in Bangkok started to evacuate. [[04:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16083.140000000001s)]
*  People running down stairwells, heading for the safety of the street. [[04:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16087.78s)]
*  A lot of screaming, a lot of panic, people running the wrong way down the escalators, [[04:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16092.18s)]
*  people running the wrong way down the escalators, like lots of banging and crashing inside the mall. [[04:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16096.74s)]
*  I got outside and then looked up at the building, that one there, [[04:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16102.98s)]
*  and this whole building was just moving, dust and debris. It was pretty intense. [[04:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16107.14s)]
*  At first, I thought my head was spinning, so I moved to see what was happening, [[04:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16114.26s)]
*  and things started swaying even more, so I quickly ran to my kids. [[04:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16118.26s)]
*  I told my kids, we can't stay here. We have to get out of here. [[04:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16122.18s)]
*  So we ran down to get outside. [[04:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16126.1s)]
*  I went on the street and I looked up and a building equivalent to this one here [[04:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16128.58s)]
*  was actually, you could see it compared to the next one, it was actually moving. [[04:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16134.18s)]
*  It was swaying and all the water was coming from the top of the, [[04:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16138.660000000002s)]
*  yeah, and that's when it caught me, you know. [[04:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16143.140000000001s)]
*  Across Bangkok, extraordinary pictures of water cascading down the side of swaying [[04:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16146.26s)]
*  buildings from rooftop swimming pools. [[04:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16151.7s)]
*  The center of this earthquake struck hundreds of miles further north in Myanmar. [[04:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16164.66s)]
*  It completely destroyed the Ava Bridge over the river Irrawaddy near Mandalay. [[04:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16170.980000000001s)]
*  In Napier Dore, the capital, roads were left bent and buckled by the quake. [[04:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16176.26s)]
*  Hospitals in the capital have declared a mass casualty event. [[04:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16183.060000000001s)]
*  It's been difficult to get information out of Myanmar, but the ruling military junta there [[04:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16187.140000000001s)]
*  has made a rare appeal for international aid, [[04:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16191.78s)]
*  and the American Geological Survey has said there could be thousands of cases. [[04:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16194.740000000002s)]
*  In Bangkok, the focus of attention is specialists, sniffer dogs have been brought in to try and find [[04:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16205.62s)]
*  survivors. It's thought as many as 80 people may be trapped inside, but already emergency services [[04:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16218.42s)]
*  are retrieving the bodies of those who lost their lives in this tragedy. [[04:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16225.78s)]
*  Graham Satchel, BBC News. [[04:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16231.14s)]
*  Well, the BBC's Lindell Markwell is at that construction site in Bangkok. [[04:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16233.94s)]
*  Lindell, what have you seen there? [[04:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16238.42s)]
*  We have had hundreds of rescue vehicles arriving here in the last few hours, [[04:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16243.14s)]
*  firefighters, medical professionals. There's a field hospital that's been set up here, [[04:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16249.300000000001s)]
*  and in the last hour or so, the Thai Prime Minister came to the site to meet with rescue [[04:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16255.62s)]
*  workers, survey the scene. One thing that hasn't happened yet is them starting to actually move the [[04:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16259.7s)]
*  rubble in this building and start the rescue process. They've been waiting for the big machinery [[04:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16266.66s)]
*  to come in. We've seen some of the big diggers coming in, but we're still waiting for cranes to [[04:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16272.26s)]
*  arrive as well so they can start the process of trying to rescue people stuck inside the building. [[04:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16276.18s)]
*  We believe some of them may be stuck inside the lift shaft inside the building here. [[04:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16281.300000000001s)]
*  So there's a lot of waiting, a lot of concern across the city. One thing the Prime Minister [[04:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16286.42s)]
*  did say is that she's spoken to engineers and they believe other buildings across the city are [[04:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16290.74s)]
*  now safe. This is the only one thought to have collapsed in the earthquake today, but I have seen [[04:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16295.380000000001s)]
*  cracks in other buildings. We've seen kind of bridges broken, windows smashed. I also saw [[04:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16301.060000000001s)]
*  water cascading down numerous buildings close to where I was on the other side of the city. [[04:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16308.34s)]
*  There's a lot of surprise here tonight still at what happened. We're not used to having big [[04:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16313.3s)]
*  earthquakes here and many say that this is probably the biggest one anyone here can remember in decades. [[04:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16317.3s)]
*  So lots of confusion, but most people are able to go back to their homes safely this evening. [[04:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16324.58s)]
*  Let's get some eyewitness idea of what went on at the time. We can speak to Travis Leon. He's a [[04:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16328.9s)]
*  content creator from Ireland who is based in Thailand. He was up on the 40th floor of his [[04:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16335.3s)]
*  apartment block when the earthquake hit. Goodness me, that must have been scary. [[04:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16341.7s)]
*  Yeah, it was absolutely terrifying. I think most people like myself thought they were having vertigo [[04:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16346.820000000002s)]
*  when this occurred. I was sitting at my desk as I normally do work in the morning time and my chair [[04:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16353.060000000001s)]
*  started to swivel. So I thought I was experiencing vertigo and I stood up and then my balcony door [[04:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16359.220000000001s)]
*  slid open and that's when I went outside to the balcony and had a good peek and I could see all [[04:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16364.18s)]
*  the water from the rooftop pool sloshing back and forth. It was a real run for your life kind [[04:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16368.98s)]
*  of moment. I've never experienced anything like that. When you say it was a run for your life [[04:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16374.9s)]
*  moment, how did you get out? Well, I'm up on the 40th floor and, you know, having seen movies, [[04:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16380.02s)]
*  I just know the elevator is a no-go. So I know there's an emergency staircase and yeah, it took [[04:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16388.98s)]
*  me quite a minute to actually realize what was going on. I've never experienced an earthquake in [[04:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16394.74s)]
*  my life. They're not very common here in Thailand either, so it was kind of the last thing that I [[04:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16398.980000000003s)]
*  thought was happening. But once I did realize, I ran outside my apartment barefoot and I got into [[04:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16403.780000000002s)]
*  the emergency stairwell and I made my way down 40 floors and that took about 15, 20 minutes. [[04:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16409.460000000003s)]
*  Everyone was panicking, running past me. Cracks were appearing down the side of the walls. It was [[04:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16416.5s)]
*  surreal. But yeah, we made it down and everyone was, you know, situated outside the condo. [[04:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16422.58s)]
*  Because presumably it's an earthquake-proof building, was it shaking? Was it swaying at [[04:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16429.7s)]
*  the time you were running down the stairs? It was absolutely swaying, yeah. That was the most crazy [[04:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16433.780000000002s)]
*  part about it because it was a sensation that you really not used to feeling, especially on a high [[04:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16441.06s)]
*  up building, the whole building moving back and forth. And when I really realized this was happening [[04:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16448.26s)]
*  was when I went out to the balcony and I was moving forward. It's a big drop down below. You can see [[04:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16453.14s)]
*  all the way down, you know, everyone looks like little Lego characters. And once you look over [[04:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16457.94s)]
*  and you could feel it going forward, I knew straight away I had to get out of there. [[04:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16462.98s)]
*  Goodness me. Stree, we're trying still to piece together the extent of the damage. What have you [[04:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16467.699999999997s)]
*  seen as you've walked around the city? Yeah, so I didn't go too far from my condo, but I made it [[04:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16473.7s)]
*  out to the street and, you know, instantly I knew what was going on, especially when I saw everyone [[04:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16480.260000000002s)]
*  running past me on the stairs. You know, there were people who were running in panics. And, [[04:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16484.260000000002s)]
*  you know, this has not happened to this magnitude in Thailand before. So no, absolutely no one [[04:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16489.46s)]
*  was expecting it. But yeah, you know, everything was built up in traffic. What I did witness and I [[04:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16494.82s)]
*  put in my TikTok video was as I was recording the video, something fell from the building beside me [[04:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16500.82s)]
*  and everyone ran screaming down the street. Once I got on social media, you know, I saw the horrific [[04:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16506.579999999998s)]
*  scenes of buildings just completely collapsing. You know, they looked like it was a controlled [[04:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16512.5s)]
*  demolition. They just fell right, you know, crumbled with nothing. So, you know, that was [[04:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16517.46s)]
*  quite tragic. Yeah, that building in the northeast of the capital, which we've been looking at, [[04:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16523.3s)]
*  yeah, appalling for the workers that were on that. So it looks to me like you're back in the flat. [[04:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16528.26s)]
*  I'm back. Yeah, we weren't allowed in for, it must have been about three or four hours. [[04:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16534.5s)]
*  We were all waiting for updates from the juristic building management. And they were basically [[04:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16539.78s)]
*  unaware of whether these aftershocks were coming or not, how strong they would be. So [[04:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16546.66s)]
*  we had to wait for that. And also they had to do the mandatory checks. You know, is there any gas [[04:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16550.899999999998s)]
*  leaks? Is the electric, you know, circuits okay? All these kind of little things to ensure that [[04:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16555.22s)]
*  the building's safe, because as you probably know, Bangkok is full of these condos. They're [[04:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16560.18s)]
*  massive and they're filled with hundreds of people. So yeah, obviously we had to make sure [[04:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16564.66s)]
*  they were fine. But eventually we got back in. The lifts still do not work. The electricity is still [[04:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16568.66s)]
*  not... The power's not back up. No, I thought you were in the dark. I didn't know whether you were [[04:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16574.100000000002s)]
*  doing it for effect, but I guess that the power wasn't on. So I mean, [[04:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16578.9s)]
*  you're a long way up. Are you feeling a bit anxious? Not anymore. Not anymore. I mean, [[04:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16586.02s)]
*  God, there could be after tremors. But from what I've seen online, they've already happened in [[04:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16591.7s)]
*  their appointment in school now. What I've read again online is they can occur within weeks or [[04:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16596.5s)]
*  months after. I don't know if this is a new thing we have to get used to now, but it certainly has [[04:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16601.300000000003s)]
*  made me rethink about getting an apartment with a nice view. Well, I'm glad you got out safely. [[04:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16606.9s)]
*  And it's really good of you to come and talk to us after such a day. Thank you very much. Sleep well. [[04:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16614.980000000003s)]
*  I was going to sleep very well tonight. We've got a couple of cans here, so we're going to relax [[04:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16621.940000000002s)]
*  with our candlelight here. Have a nice evening. Right, so you're well equipped. Very good. [[04:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16629.06s)]
*  Barely. Travis, it's good to talk to you. Thank you for coming on the programme. Lovely. [[04:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16634.02s)]
*  We've just seen pictures, Lynel, of the Prime Minister on location taking a view. [[04:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16638.100000000002s)]
*  Do they have everything they need there to begin that rescue operation? [[04:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16644.74s)]
*  They're still working by the sounds of it to get everything here that they need. We've seen in the [[04:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16651.620000000003s)]
*  last couple of hours some diggers arriving, some much more heavy machinery. At first, we were just [[04:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16656.100000000002s)]
*  seeing fire trucks, medical professionals, a field hospital being set up, but now we're seeing on the [[04:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16660.74s)]
*  site they've got a few diggers. They're waiting for some cranes. We've also seen they've been [[04:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16666.34s)]
*  using drones to survey the site. There have been some dogs arriving, some sniffer dogs. So they're [[04:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16671.38s)]
*  getting ready. They've set up floodlights, as you can see, across the site so that they can work [[04:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16676.9s)]
*  through the night here. I was just mentioning to our viewers that she's not been in office very long, [[04:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16682.02s)]
*  six or seven months. It's a big challenge for her because this has been felt right across the country. [[04:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16687.7s)]
*  There will be people who need help. [[04:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16692.98s)]
*  It's a huge challenge when an earthquake strikes any country. Obviously, they'll be looking to [[04:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16698.420000000002s)]
*  Myanmar as well and the huge destruction that we understand has taken place there today and looking [[04:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16703.06s)]
*  to how they can help their neighbour, I'm sure, as well. I think one thing that she did make clear [[04:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16708.5s)]
*  this evening is that she's spoken to engineers across the city and they believe that other tower [[04:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16712.74s)]
*  blocks, other buildings across the city, have been able to withstand this level of earthquake and they [[04:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16717.38s)]
*  are safe for people to return to their homes this evening. So many people are now off the streets. [[04:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16722.260000000002s)]
*  They were waiting in the streets earlier. They're now returning to their buildings. [[04:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16726.74s)]
*  There is damage still and there will be a lot of repairs to be done across the city. Obviously, [[04:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16731.22s)]
*  not only with this situation here that they need to deal with imminently, but there will be other [[04:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16735.22s)]
*  repairs that need to take place and people will be concerned by some of the damage they've seen. [[04:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16739.7s)]
*  Yeah, of course they will. I've been in one myself and I know that it plays on your nerves. You feel [[04:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16744.260000000002s)]
*  the anxiety, particularly at nightfall when you're thinking about going to bed. Just remind us where [[04:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16749.7s)]
*  you were and what you felt and how scary it was. Yeah, I mean, I was at home, fortunately, and I [[04:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16755.46s)]
*  live on the first floor. So I felt as though the room was swaying. I actually thought I've not had [[04:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16763.22s)]
*  lunch and maybe I'm a bit dizzy. And then I started to think, well, maybe this is an earthquake. I've [[04:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16769.14s)]
*  never experienced one in Bangkok. I've been here over two years and my other colleagues here say [[04:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16773.46s)]
*  it's incredibly rare. This is the biggest they felt in decades. I went down to the ground floor [[04:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16777.78s)]
*  where the pool on the ground floor was sloshing out water. And then when I went outside of my [[04:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16783.78s)]
*  building, I could see the tower blocks around me with water cascading down, you know, more than [[04:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16788.02s)]
*  two of them in the close surrounds to where I was. It was a very strange feeling, lots of people, [[04:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16793.62s)]
*  very confused and trying to understand what was happening. There was no warning of this earthquake [[04:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16799.78s)]
*  as far as we were aware. And in the hour afterwards, there was also concern about aftershocks. [[04:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16806.899999999998s)]
*  I felt a very small one. The bigger one we were concerned about didn't come. But the traffic [[04:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16812.42s)]
*  ended up, you know, Bangkok is a very, very busy city and the traffic's bad a lot of the time [[04:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16818.18s)]
*  anyway. But the traffic in the aftermath was gridlock. And to get across the city, I was in [[04:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16823.3s)]
*  the east of the city. I've come to the northwest where this construction site is. It took a long [[04:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16828.34s)]
*  time to get across the city. The only way to do it was on a motorbike, really, to weave in and out [[04:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16832.899999999998s)]
*  the traffic. There were sirens howling the whole time, emergency service vehicles trying to get [[04:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16836.579999999998s)]
*  across the city as well. So it's been a very strange day for many people in Bangkok. [[04:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16841.86s)]
*  A very strange day for Thai people and for people in Myanmar as well. But I'm very conscious as well [[04:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16846.98s)]
*  that there are a lot of tourists, a lot of Brits and Europeans who go to Thailand and will be there [[04:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16852.34s)]
*  for the Easter holidays perhaps. And they might be watching us across Thailand. Do they have reason [[04:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16858.58s)]
*  to be concerned? Has there been any advice put out to expats, travelling people in the country, [[04:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16863.86s)]
*  what they should do, maybe who they should call? And is there a problem with any infrastructure [[04:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16869.38s)]
*  at the airports? As far as we're aware in terms of the infrastructure, I mean, [[04:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16874.74s)]
*  within Bangkok, the MRT and the BTS, which is the transport system, the train transport system [[04:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16882.1s)]
*  across the city, that has been suspended, was suspended and remains suspended this evening. [[04:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16887.78s)]
*  And it's been very difficult moving around the city. One of the airports there were delays at, [[04:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16893.699999999997s)]
*  one of the airports was still functioning as far as we're aware. Some of the roads were shut down, [[04:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16898.579999999998s)]
*  so it was harder to get around the city. But we're not hearing about any injuries of expats. We're [[04:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16902.26s)]
*  not hearing of there being concerns sort of more widely. It's unclear kind of when the transport [[04:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16907.14s)]
*  system will be fully up and running again, if people are trying to travel from one place to [[04:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16913.86s)]
*  another. Not all the flights have been taking off. And also it was hard to get to an airport, [[04:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16917.059999999998s)]
*  even if your flight was taking off. But there isn't a specific concern in Bangkok in terms of [[04:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16921.059999999998s)]
*  other people being injured at the moment. And I think this is really our focus tonight in terms of [[04:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16926.82s)]
*  the people across the city. This is where everyone's focusing now tonight to hope these [[04:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16931.78s)]
*  people are rescued. Let's get more from Esme Stallard, who's here and could give us a broader [[04:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16936.66s)]
*  idea of the map and where Thailand is in relation to the plates, Esme. Exactly. So if we just start [[04:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16941.3s)]
*  from the beginning. So we had this earthquake at 6.20 GMT around lunchtime, local time, and it [[04:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16948.5s)]
*  occurred here near Sige in Myanmar. Now that's in a thousand kilometres away from Bangkok, but this [[04:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16955.22s)]
*  was such a big earthquake that it was felt as far away as that. I'll show you some of the other [[04:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16961.06s)]
*  aftershocks that happened. So this is a map from the US Geological Survey. So they are the US [[04:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16965.38s)]
*  government science arm that monitors earthquakes. And there was this first one, that one that I [[04:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16970.58s)]
*  mentioned there, but then later, just 12 minutes afterwards, there was another one just south of [[04:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16974.98s)]
*  it, which is also very significant, and a series of other ones in the north. Now, why are they [[04:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16979.7s)]
*  occurring in this region? Well, that's to do with the different plate boundaries that are here. So [[04:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16985.14s)]
*  the earth is covered in a crust and that is split into lots of different plates and they're [[04:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16990.5s)]
*  constantly moving past or below or above each other. And sometimes when they get stuck, a lot [[04:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16994.42s)]
*  of friction builds up and that gets released as a huge amount of energy in earthquakes. Now, [[04:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=16999.699999999997s)]
*  Myanmar is in a very active zone. The Indian plate is down here, the Eurasian plate up here, [[04:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17004.5s)]
*  they are colliding and then there is a big fault zone here, the Sige fault. Now, friction we think [[04:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17010.019999999997s)]
*  has built up along that fault and as it got released, it created this earthquake. Now you [[04:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17016.339999999997s)]
*  can see on this map how far away Bangkok is and that shows how big an earthquake it was. [[04:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17021.22s)]
*  The other thing we're quite concerned about is even though we expect earthquakes in this area, [[04:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17026.420000000002s)]
*  10 kilometres below the surface, that means it can going to be felt quite significantly there. [[04:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17030.74s)]
*  The other thing, the reason we think it was felt so far away is that this fault line is actually [[04:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17036.260000000002s)]
*  quite straight, which means the energy can really travel down it to other countries. Now, we haven't [[04:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17040.66s)]
*  heard that much about what's actually happening on the ground in Myanmar. Obviously, we know that's [[04:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17046.34s)]
*  because some of the telegraph lines are down, but I think we can take from what's happening in [[04:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17050.82s)]
*  Bangkok as evidence. The US Geological Survey, who I mentioned before, said for an earthquake of this [[04:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17055.06s)]
*  size, we could be looking at deaths in excess of tens of thousands of people. So it is quite [[04:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17059.94s)]
*  concerning at the moment, Christian. A powerful earthquake has struck Myanmar. [[04:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17065.86s)]
*  The US Geological Survey said it's had a magnitude of 7.7. The epicenter was near the city of [[04:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17074.1s)]
*  Mandalay. Initial reports suggested it caused significant damage. Strong tremors from the same [[04:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17080.66s)]
*  earthquake have been felt in Bangkok in neighbouring Thailand. Joining us from Bangkok is Bui Tu, [[04:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17086.9s)]
*  a resident in the city. Thank you for joining us on Newsday. Just tell us what happened where you are. [[04:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17094.1s)]
*  Hello, I'm here in Bangkok city and I was at home cooking. Well, I felt the first [[04:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17101.7s)]
*  strike and I was very nervous and I was very panicked. I didn't know what it was because [[04:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17108.9s)]
*  it has been, I think, a decade since Bangkok had a really strong or powerful earthquake like this. [[04:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17115.3s)]
*  So we, and then the second strike, I had to run onto the street and I saw a lot of people [[04:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17122.1s)]
*  did the same thing out of the buildings because it's a big condo, a big apartment. So everyone [[04:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17130.02s)]
*  ran onto the street and I saw the swimming pools, like pooling water. [[04:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17136.899999999998s)]
*  And we were very, literally in panic because for the context, I think there has been an [[04:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17148.42s)]
*  earthquake like this powerful in Bangkok for decades and Thailand is not an as-worked zone. [[04:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17157.94s)]
*  So nearly all earthquakes with a were felt in Bangkok are in Myanmar. So that's for that reason, [[04:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17164.58s)]
*  buildings in Bangkok are not engineered for large earthquakes. So that's why I think that it's going [[04:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17172.58s)]
*  to be a big damage in structure. And some are reported to have collapsed, some buildings have [[04:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17180.02s)]
*  collapsed already. So I'm still monitoring the news. Yeah, I'm safe now. [[04:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17189.3s)]
*  You're safe now. We're thankful for that. Just tell us what you saw around you. You mentioned the tremors, [[04:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17196.899999999998s)]
*  any damage, any people hurt where you are? [[04:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17204.82s)]
*  In my apartment, I just see some cracking on the wall and water splashed out of the swimming [[04:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17210.1s)]
*  pools. And people just like yelling and they were like pour all on the exit floors. So we're trying [[04:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17219.140000000003s)]
*  to grab our head around what's going on. So we just like standing on the street for a long time [[04:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17230.82s)]
*  until we have another announcement, should we go back to our dream or not. So it was literally the [[04:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17237.620000000003s)]
*  panic on the face of a lot of people. Because not only Thai people but foreigners haven't had this [[04:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17244.5s)]
*  kind of life experiences as well. So we were so panicked. [[04:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17251.06s)]
*  Yes, I can imagine. And it's around 20 past two in the afternoon there in Thailand. I imagine [[04:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17258.98s)]
*  lots of people would have been at work at school and as you were saying, you were at home cooking. [[04:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17266.42s)]
*  Yeah, and I can sort of some friends calling me that they were stuck in on the sky train. [[04:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17272.66s)]
*  I mean, it's a very big thing for a lot of people because like I said, we have been experiencing [[04:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17280.5s)]
*  earthquakes for decades. So we didn't know that it's a real earthquake in the first place. And a [[04:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17289.539999999997s)]
*  lot of people didn't know how to react to that. So some of them still have to wrap their head around [[04:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17297.86s)]
*  to the minute that we decide to run on the street or find a place to hide. So I hope that everyone [[04:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17304.82s)]
*  is going to be safe. But I can see that a lot of people are panicked. When I ran out of the room, [[04:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17312.34s)]
*  I can see a lot of people that they don't know should they go or should they stay at home inside [[04:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17319.62s)]
*  a room. So I really hope that people are going to be safe. And you mentioned the sky trains, [[04:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17325.62s)]
*  these elevated train transit systems high up in the sky there in Bangkok. We understand that [[04:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17333.059999999998s)]
*  the government will be holding a special meeting as a result of the earthquake. Has the government [[04:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17342.66s)]
*  given you any special orders, directives on what you should do next? Oh, we haven't [[04:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17349.219999999998s)]
*  received anything yet. But at that time, the SkyTrain staff has announced to flee people. [[04:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17355.22s)]
*  So I think that they managed to control the situation. But because this is very [[04:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17366.5s)]
*  unexpected experience for everyone. So we were very panicked. So I think that maybe there's [[04:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17374.34s)]
*  going to be some chaos, of course. But the situation seems under control now. [[04:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17383.3s)]
*  Bui Chiu, thank you for speaking to us despite being in a very difficult situation. Of course, [[04:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17389.7s)]
*  we can also hear the emotion and the shock in your voice. Thank you for speaking to us here on [[04:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17394.82s)]
*  Newsday. That's Bui Chiu telling us about this earthquake that has struck in Myanmar and tremors [[04:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17400.739999999998s)]
*  from the same earthquake have also been felt in Bangkok, where Bui Chiu was speaking to us from. [[04:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17408.26s)]
*  Now, whenever there is an earthquake, a lot of video is posted on social media. We saw [[04:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17415.539999999997s)]
*  that video of the moment that the building came down. Important that we hear at the BBC, [[04:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17423.059999999998s)]
*  make sure that we verify all of the pictures before we show them. So that is what our team [[04:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17429.859999999997s)]
*  is doing at the moment. And Jake Horton is part of the BBC Verify team and is with me in the studio. [[04:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17434.5s)]
*  So Jake, it is difficult whenever there is a disaster. There's a lot of video posted on [[04:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17440.18s)]
*  social media. You've been going through it. Yes. Everyone at the BBC Verify has been going through [[04:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17446.02s)]
*  a slew of video that comes in to verify if it's genuine, if it's recent, if it's new, [[04:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17450.74s)]
*  and if it shows the earthquake in Myanmar. And one of the biggest difficulties we found is that [[04:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17455.86s)]
*  internet access in Myanmar is restricted since the military took over the country in 2021. And [[04:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17462.82s)]
*  also, obviously, there's service issues at the moment because there's been a major earthquake [[04:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17468.42s)]
*  in the country. We have managed to verify some videos out of Myanmar, including one we can play [[04:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17472.98s)]
*  for you now, which shows the scene at Mandalay International Airport, which is about 18 kilometres [[04:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17478.42s)]
*  from the epicentre of the earthquake. And in the video, you can see about a couple dozen people [[04:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17483.78s)]
*  taking cover on the tarmac of that airport. And you can also see in the video, you can see [[04:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17489.38s)]
*  the triangular structures on the roof. They're quite distinctive. And we can pair those triangular [[04:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17496.5s)]
*  structures you can see on the roof of that airport hangar to satellite images we have on Google Earth. [[04:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17502.420000000002s)]
*  So that was taken at Mandalay Airport. And we also do reverse image searches, which tell us [[04:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17510.260000000002s)]
*  how recent that video was. And we can say that video was posted this morning. There are no [[04:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17515.46s)]
*  earlier versions of that video online that we can find. So we can say where it is and how recent it [[04:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17520.42s)]
*  was. I find this fascinating you as a teammate. And you're saying literally, because those buildings [[04:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17525.3s)]
*  have the triangular bits at the top, that is how you can confirm that that is Mandalay. Yes, [[04:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17531.54s)]
*  they're quite distinctive. You can see the colours and the patterns on the triangular formations on [[04:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17536.899999999998s)]
*  the top of that roof are quite distinctive. And you can look at aerial pictures of Mandalay Airport [[04:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17540.899999999998s)]
*  on Google Earth, and they're quite easy to match up. So yeah, that is how we verified that one. [[04:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17545.14s)]
*  And there's also been more footage out of Bangkok. You've been reporting on the skyscraper that [[04:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17551.38s)]
*  collapsed, the 30 story skyscraper that collapsed. And we managed to verify two pieces of video of [[04:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17555.86s)]
*  that. This is one from close up just below the building as it collapses. And we also have another [[04:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17560.739999999998s)]
*  one which is further away. And we managed to do that by looking at Google Street View in Bangkok. [[04:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17567.14s)]
*  And the building is in the northeast of the city. And the exterior of the building on Google Street [[04:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17573.22s)]
*  View matches the exterior of the building we see in this video. So it's about 30 stories high. Like [[04:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17578.5s)]
*  you said, it's under construction. But images on Google Street View at the end of last year [[04:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17583.059999999998s)]
*  match the exterior. And we confirm it is where it is by doing that sort of work at BBC Verify. [[04:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17588.02s)]
*  And you also mentioned with the pictures from Mandalay, this reverse image search. Just explain [[04:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17593.14s)]
*  how that works. Yeah, so it sounds more complicated and scientific than what it is basically. [[04:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17600.34s)]
*  Basically, you take screen grabs of videos and you put them through a search engine like Google or [[04:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17606.02s)]
*  the other reverse image search engines. And that will give you previous results of when that image [[04:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17611.06s)]
*  was posted elsewhere online before. And it's not 100% certain. There might be times where certain [[04:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17615.78s)]
*  results don't come up. But for instance, in this case, we can see that no images match that [[04:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17621.46s)]
*  skyscraper or the similar images we saw at Mandalay Airport have appeared online [[04:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17626.5s)]
*  before this morning. So we can say with a good degree of certainty that they haven't been posted [[04:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17633.78s)]
*  before. So they're likely to be recent images of the incident. Let's go to Bangkok. And P. [[04:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17638.34s)]
*  San Lekit Prechal, who is there and was in an apartment on the 11th floor when the earthquake [[04:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17644.18s)]
*  struck. Thank you very much for joining us on BBC News. I wondered if you could [[04:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17651.46s)]
*  just describe to us what you felt and what happened when the earthquake struck. [[04:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17655.46s)]
*  Well, I was alone in an apartment with my dog. And then suddenly I felt like dizzy. So I thought [[04:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17661.86s)]
*  maybe, yeah, something happening to my body. And then I came actually out into the hall. And then [[04:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17668.26s)]
*  I saw the light hanging. That was swaying quite big in a big way. And then I realized that it was [[04:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17674.42s)]
*  an earthquake. So I sat down with my dog. And then, yeah, and it was shaking for something like a [[04:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17686.019999999997s)]
*  minute, which was quite scary because I have never experienced this in Bangkok before. It's very [[04:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17694.179999999997s)]
*  unprecedented. And then after that, there was an aftershock about maybe 10 minutes later, which was [[04:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17700.58s)]
*  smaller and didn't last as long. So after that, it became calm. But then I also heard a lot of [[04:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17709.22s)]
*  sirens going nearby in the street. And also I checked on the internet. And because I live [[04:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17718.34s)]
*  quite close to the Queen's Circuit National Convention Centre, where at the moment there [[04:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17728.66s)]
*  is the national book fair going on with tens of thousands of people inside. So I saw a video that [[04:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17735.94s)]
*  people are evacuating and then pouring outside and also into the park, the big park nearby. [[04:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17742.42s)]
*  So it was quite, yeah, I was shaken. But yeah, after the aftershock, [[04:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17752.1s)]
*  so I thought that the worst has passed. But now that we are actually seeing the, you know, [[04:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17760.26s)]
*  like the impact and the consequences of the earthquake, I'm very distressed by the loss of [[04:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17766.26s)]
*  lives of the construction workers who are trapped under that collapsed building and also the [[04:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17772.66s)]
*  images from Myanmar. I hope that we will, the international community will quickly assemble [[04:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17781.3s)]
*  support, search and rescue and humanitarian aid to our friends in Myanmar. [[04:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17791.3s)]
*  Absolutely. You described how the shaking lasted for about a minute. Were there other people in [[04:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17796.739999999998s)]
*  your apartment block and what were they saying when you got out onto the street? [[04:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17803.7s)]
*  Well, there were a lot of people. [[04:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17807.7s)]
*  Went out on the street and most people just, you know, were in a panic and didn't know what [[04:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17822.34s)]
*  was going on because as I said, it's quite unprecedented. And then, yeah, we were waiting [[04:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17827.940000000002s)]
*  outside and yeah, nothing came further. So many of us came back into the building, [[04:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17835.3s)]
*  but still remained vigilant. I came back and then I started to, you know, like putting things in my [[04:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17840.739999999998s)]
*  emergency bag. So I, well, of course, still vigilant and, you know, hopefully we will [[04:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17846.5s)]
*  see through this. Hopefully there will be no more aftershocks. [[04:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17854.739999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. And Thailand isn't used to big earthquakes, is it? You said you've never [[04:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17859.38s)]
*  felt anything like that. How long have you lived in Thailand? [[04:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17865.7s)]
*  But this is like the strongest that I have had, I have felt. [[04:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17889.3s)]
*  And was there amongst the people that you came out with a sense of panic or were you quite calm [[04:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17893.7s)]
*  once you got outside? I think, yeah, there's also a sense of panic. People try to reach out to their [[04:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17900.1s)]
*  loved ones on the mobile phone, on, you know, like messaging apps and like Line or WhatsApp. But yeah, [[04:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17907.7s)]
*  it didn't go through a lot of time. So like people are really concerned. And also because I, [[04:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17917.94s)]
*  in the beginning, we didn't really know what is going on, like how much damage has been caused [[04:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17924.739999999998s)]
*  or yeah. So, and also there's also, I think at the moment, a lot of traffic jam outside because [[04:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17933.219999999998s)]
*  there are some roadblocks due to some fallen objects onto the tollway entrance and also [[04:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17941.460000000003s)]
*  some damages to the infrastructure. So I think, yeah, traffic will be difficult. And also the [[04:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17952.74s)]
*  public transport systems also have been suspended until further notice. So yeah, a lot of people [[04:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17959.780000000002s)]
*  are stuck in the city. And so there have been calls for people to carpool. [[04:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17965.78s)]
*  It's a 7.7 magnitude earthquake and it struck Myanmar. The particular area that it struck was [[04:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17974.1s)]
*  near the city of Mandalay. It's actually a city called Sagan. And the Red Cross say there are [[04:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17982.82s)]
*  teams are attempting to get there, but they are reporting significant damage in Myanmar, [[04:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17990.98s)]
*  but are facing, as you can imagine, challenges getting there, particularly due to a lack of [[04:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=17997.78s)]
*  power in the affected area. The humanitarian organization, the Red Cross, obviously is one [[05:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18002.34s)]
*  of the organizations that will always react to an earthquake. They say that the electricity and [[05:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18008.98s)]
*  network lines are down in the Mandalay and the Sagan areas that the epicentre at the Red Cross [[05:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18015.06s)]
*  saying it is continuing to gather information on the humanitarian needs as a result of the damage. [[05:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18021.54s)]
*  So this massive earthquake, it was what's known as a shallow earthquake, about 10 kilometers [[05:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18027.7s)]
*  under the ground. We're going to take a while to get all of the information out of Myanmar because [[05:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18032.420000000002s)]
*  the communication networks, as I was mentioning, are down. But we do have these images out of [[05:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18038.34s)]
*  Thailand where we know that there has been this building collapse, a building that was under [[05:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18045.06s)]
*  construction and three people have died. And the authorities saying that seven people did manage [[05:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18051.7s)]
*  to get out, but 43 missing. We think that 43 does take into account the three that have died. [[05:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18058.66s)]
*  I want to play you some people who were in Thailand at the moment that the quake struck. [[05:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18067.78s)]
*  They've been describing what happened. Take a listen. I was checking a message on my mobile [[05:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18075.86s)]
*  phone. I was in my Lazy Boy and all of a sudden it moved back and forth and then it toppled over [[05:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18082.739999999998s)]
*  and I hit my head on the table, but it didn't leave a mark and I didn't break the glass table [[05:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18090.739999999998s)]
*  either. This is not the first time that the building has felt an earthquake. In 2004, [[05:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18097.06s)]
*  when the tsunami and the earthquake happened in Sumatra, the building shook immensely for [[05:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18107.38s)]
*  almost 30 minutes and then it had cracks in the walls. But never like this before. [[05:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18114.420000000002s)]
*  I was waiting for the bill and then suddenly I started feeling the earth is shaking. You know, [[05:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18123.22s)]
*  my first thought is that maybe somebody is not feeling it, just me, something is wrong with me, [[05:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18127.62s)]
*  but everybody was looking around and right away we were all going outside because you could feel [[05:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18133.06s)]
*  it's going to last for a while. I have experienced earthquakes twice before in Myanmar, but that was [[05:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18138.9s)]
*  only like one second of one big bang and here it went on for at least I would say a minute. [[05:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18144.58s)]
*  Let's go to Tom Beeston who lives and works in Bangkok and joins us now. Tom, thank you very [[05:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18153.22s)]
*  much for your time here on BBC News. Can you describe what happened to you when the quake struck? [[05:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18158.74s)]
*  Yeah, it was one of the weirdest things I've ever lived for, to be honest. We were on the 31st floor [[05:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18165.46s)]
*  of our co-working building. I was with a friend and he kind of looked at me funny and said like, [[05:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18168.74s)]
*  oh I think I've got vertigo and then suddenly everyone else around us started also, you know, [[05:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18173.3s)]
*  looking at each other and then people, thankfully, were with us and people who knew what they were [[05:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18178.26s)]
*  doing. They ducked straight under the desks and you have that moment where you don't really know [[05:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18182.579999999998s)]
*  what's happening then it suddenly clicks like, oh this is an earthquake. So yeah, we kind of got [[05:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18186.18s)]
*  under our desks, ducked the cover and then there was that weird period where because we were so [[05:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18190.82s)]
*  high up we were like, are we better off sheltering here or should we kind of try and get downstairs [[05:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18194.66s)]
*  as quickly as possible? So then before we knew it we were all rushing down the stairs as fast as we [[05:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18198.739999999998s)]
*  can with, you know, hundreds of other people around us and yeah it was chaos. How long did the tremor [[05:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18203.379999999997s)]
*  go on for and you say you were on the 31st floor. What were the other people around you like on that [[05:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18210.1s)]
*  floor? Yeah, I mean it was confusion and then a bit of panic and then just kind of trying to [[05:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18216.579999999998s)]
*  get yourself together to actually think about what to do but, you know, we could see the building [[05:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18223.219999999998s)]
*  really felt like it was shaking. We could also see across from us swimming pools and other buildings [[05:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18229.059999999998s)]
*  were overflowing. So then when you realize that an earthquake is actually happening it's then, [[05:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18233.94s)]
*  okay, we need to get ourselves downstairs but it was very confusing, very panicky and yeah. [[05:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18238.42s)]
*  So you ended up on the street outside. How many other people were there and what was their reaction, [[05:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18245.539999999997s)]
*  the other people there? There was hundreds and hundreds of people. The roads are all gridlocked [[05:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18251.859999999997s)]
*  as well and it's gone. There was mainly people on phones trying to fool family, friends, kind of see [[05:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18256.98s)]
*  what's going on, see if everything's okay and again it's just you sometimes look at people and [[05:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18262.339999999997s)]
*  kind of laugh because you don't know what's just happened and what you've just been through. [[05:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18266.5s)]
*  Look at other people, you just kind of have a disbelieved shock and yeah. How long have you [[05:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18270.02s)]
*  lived in Bangkok and have you ever witnessed anything like this before? I've been in Thailand [[05:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18276.58s)]
*  for about 18 months now and no and it's one of those things where you never think it can happen [[05:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18283.38s)]
*  to you and that's why at the start there was such a period of not knowing what was going on and I [[05:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18288.66s)]
*  had a thought, oh this is an earthquake, then a secondary thought of no it can't be, you know, [[05:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18294.26s)]
*  that wouldn't happen here but then you bring it out and it sets in and yeah it's the first time [[05:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18298.42s)]
*  I've ever experienced something like this. You mentioned the swimming pools, let me show our [[05:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18303.78s)]
*  audience if they're watching here on BBC News exactly what you were talking about. So it's [[05:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18308.26s)]
*  pools on the top of these very tall apartment buildings and the strength of the shaking meant [[05:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18312.66s)]
*  that the water came over. Tom almost like a waterfall. Yeah I thought one building had [[05:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18318.18s)]
*  like a burst pipe or something because from our angle it was just torrents and torrents of water [[05:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18324.9s)]
*  coming outside there. And what have the emergency services said? Have you had any messages about [[05:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18329.46s)]
*  what you are supposed to do or was it a case of the people who were outside a bit of common sense [[05:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18335.46s)]
*  going on? Yeah definitely a long period of staying outside, not going you know back into buildings, [[05:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18340.02s)]
*  things like that because aftershocks are common and for a long time afterwards I think we were [[05:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18346.02s)]
*  sat outside the building for a good 90 minutes just everyone just kind of sat there not really [[05:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18350.34s)]
*  sure when to move or what to do and we walked, we found, we walked to go find like an outdoor area [[05:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18354.98s)]
*  and there were closed businesses with the staff kind of sitting outside everyone just kind of sat [[05:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18360.260000000002s)]
*  around talking and it's definitely like an air of uncertainty of kind of when to go back to normal [[05:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18364.5s)]
*  and how long you kind of should wait in this kind of circumstance. And you're obviously inside at [[05:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18368.98s)]
*  the moment have you gone back into the building or have you gone somewhere else? We did, we waited [[05:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18373.94s)]
*  about an hour to 90 minutes and we really sprinted up the 31 flights of stairs to get our laptops, [[05:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18380.02s)]
*  not sure if that's the best judgment call and also we should have done that but we didn't trust the [[05:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18386.34s)]
*  lifts so we had a very sweaty run up to the 31st floor and a very quick sprint back downstairs [[05:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18389.94s)]
*  just so we could get away from the city centre and get ourselves an open area with our valuables. [[05:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18394.899999999998s)]
*  Concerned I assume that there might be aftershocks? [[05:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18400.5s)]
*  Yes, yeah exactly you know you never know what you do there about it so. [[05:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18404.02s)]
*  Okay Tom thank you very much for your time, appreciate it, glad you're safe after that [[05:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18408.26s)]
*  experience on the 31st floor of that tower block, appreciate your time. That's Tom [[05:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18413.059999999998s)]
*  Beeston who works and lives in Bangkok. As I mentioned it is a big earthquake, it's 7.7 [[05:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18416.899999999998s)]
*  on in terms of the magnitude and Dr Brian Bapty is a seismologist at the British Geological Survey, [[05:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18424.66s)]
*  he explained how serious a quake of that magnitude is. [[05:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18432.26s)]
*  So this is a very large earthquake, it's capable of causing extreme damage close to the epicentre [[05:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18437.14s)]
*  and it's likely to have been felt further away. The city of Mandalay which is the second largest [[05:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18444.66s)]
*  city in Myanmar and has a population of over a million was only about 17 kilometres away from [[05:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18450.26s)]
*  the epicentre so it seems likely that there'll be significant damage and fatalities there. [[05:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18455.78s)]
*  And just to explain we also heard that it was what's known as a shallow [[05:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18462.579999999998s)]
*  earthquake, explain what that is and the significance of that. [[05:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18466.579999999998s)]
*  So earthquakes occur at a range of depths throughout the earth's crust and deeper [[05:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18472.179999999997s)]
*  but in this particular region of the Burmese arc if you like, earthquakes are generally quite [[05:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18477.46s)]
*  shallow. We think that this earthquake occurred on a kind of major fault system that marks the [[05:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18483.7s)]
*  plate boundary between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian or the Sunda plates and earthquakes [[05:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18489.219999999998s)]
*  that are typically at depths of less than 20 kilometres. So you mentioned the plates, [[05:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18495.059999999998s)]
*  just explain how many are in that area and the basics of how an earthquake would happen with [[05:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18501.620000000003s)]
*  those plates. So the outer shell of the earth is made up of all these different segments [[05:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18508.420000000002s)]
*  and those segments are moving around. Now they're moving pretty slowly, maybe a few [[05:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18515.460000000003s)]
*  centimeters a year but as they collide with and move past each other that generates incredible [[05:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18519.780000000002s)]
*  forces and over time those forces build up in the form of strain and eventually some of that [[05:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18525.06s)]
*  strain needs to be accommodated either in the form of deformation or in the form of slip on [[05:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18530.98s)]
*  earthquake faults and when the rocks on either side of those faults slide past each other and in a [[05:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18537.22s)]
*  magnitude 7.7 we'd expect the kind of rupture to move several meters and that releases huge amounts [[05:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18542.74s)]
*  of energy and that causes the shaking that people feel at the surface. And we had the initial [[05:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18548.9s)]
*  earthquake but then a second one of 6.4 slightly after, is that classed as an aftershock or is it [[05:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18555.38s)]
*  a separate earthquake? No that would be classed as an aftershock. Large earthquakes and in fact [[05:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18565.06s)]
*  most earthquakes are followed by aftershocks. Those aftershocks occur because of the kind of [[05:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18571.22s)]
*  change in stress in the earth's crust so some of that stress is accommodated in the form of [[05:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18576.82s)]
*  these additional earthquakes as stress is kind of transferred onto the onto different parts of fault [[05:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18582.1s)]
*  systems. And I assume there is now a concern that there will be further aftershocks, how likely would [[05:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18587.3s)]
*  that be? I think that aftershocks are almost certain. For a magnitude 7.7 the rule of thumb [[05:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18594.579999999998s)]
*  is that the largest aftershocks likely to be round about magnitude 6.7. So that 6.4 that happened [[05:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18602.5s)]
*  earlier this morning that's probably close to being the kind of largest magnitude of aftershock [[05:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18609.22s)]
*  we would expect. The aftershocks typically decay quite quickly with time after the main shock [[05:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18613.86s)]
*  so the number will decrease rapidly after a few days or weeks but large earthquakes can still [[05:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18620.74s)]
*  occur and those could still be a concern and could still cause damage especially to buildings [[05:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18627.46s)]
*  that are already badly damaged. And just give us a sense of how prone Myanmar itself is to [[05:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18632.899999999998s)]
*  earthquakes. How many have there been in the past and have they been as big as this one? [[05:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18639.86s)]
*  Yeah so this is an area where the earthquake hazard is high and many large earthquakes have [[05:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18645.78s)]
*  occurred in the region. In the last 100 years or so there have been 14 earthquakes with a magnitude [[05:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18651.06s)]
*  of 6 or above within 200 kilometres of the epicentre of today's earthquake. The largest of those had [[05:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18657.620000000003s)]
*  a magnitude of 7.6 so similar to today's earthquake but it occurred in 1946 a little bit further north [[05:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18665.06s)]
*  in the Saigang region. There was also a magnitude 6.8 in 1956 that was quite close to Mandalay [[05:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18671.940000000002s)]
*  that did cause quite significant damage but fortunately the number of casualties or the [[05:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18679.38s)]
*  number of reported casualties anyway was quite small. And this is always the situation when [[05:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18684.100000000002s)]
*  there's an earthquake we get the initial report from the US Geological Survey and I know that [[05:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18689.38s)]
*  you in the UK would have monitoring as well. It is always a bit later once we get to see the pictures [[05:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18695.14s)]
*  and the authorities get there on the scale of an earthquake. I think the impact of an earthquake [[05:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18701.22s)]
*  always unfolds with time as more information becomes available. At the moment we expect it to [[05:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18708.26s)]
*  be devastating. There is likely to be very significant damage and the fact that there's [[05:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18713.78s)]
*  a kind of large exposed population living in vulnerable buildings close to where the shaking [[05:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18720.42s)]
*  was strongest probably means there will be large numbers of fatalities. And were you surprised by [[05:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18725.379999999997s)]
*  the fact that it has been felt so strongly a thousand kilometres away in the Thai capital? [[05:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18732.26s)]
*  I'm not surprised that it's felt. I think that you might expect that but I am a bit surprised [[05:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18739.3s)]
*  that it's caused the collapse of the building that's been seen in those media clips. [[05:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18745.379999999997s)]
*  Yes because modern buildings are some of them. We know that Thailand itself isn't particularly [[05:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18750.42s)]
*  earthquake prone but there are when buildings are constructed people do think about things like that. [[05:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18756.82s)]
*  I would expect any large tower block or any large building even in areas that maybe aren't so prone [[05:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18763.86s)]
*  to earthquakes to have been designed with earthquakes in mind. It seems that this building [[05:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18770.739999999998s)]
*  was actually under construction so I don't know what the exact situation was. Similarly I don't [[05:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18776.579999999998s)]
*  know exactly what the planning regulations are in Thailand. Are you interested in the fact that it [[05:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18781.78s)]
*  was felt very strongly in Thailand but we're getting less reports from Bangladesh which is the other side? [[05:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18786.98s)]
*  Yeah that's possible because the earthquake occurred on this kind of major fault system [[05:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18796.1s)]
*  that I mentioned and it runs north south so it's possible that the shaking was somewhat [[05:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18802.18s)]
*  larger to the south than to the kind of west of epicenter so that could be what's called a radiation effect. [[05:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18807.86s)]
*  Let's talk to another eyewitness. This is Jonathan Hugen who was on the eighth floor of his apartment [[05:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18818.739999999998s)]
*  block in Bangkok. So not quite as high as the 31st floor Jonathan but just describe what happened [[05:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18823.539999999997s)]
*  to you when the earthquake hit. To be honest I grew up in California and Hawaii and I've [[05:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18829.539999999997s)]
*  experienced earthquakes before so it was kind of a deja vu feeling. I've been in Thailand 12 years [[05:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18838.579999999998s)]
*  and never experienced anything like it here and I just kind of like wow I've felt this before and [[05:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18844.5s)]
*  then the initial shock of being in an earthquake kind of wore out. I was like oh this is an [[05:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18851.539999999997s)]
*  earthquake. So in the building I was in it was pretty substantial. I mean it really did shake [[05:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18857.78s)]
*  this place and it lasted. It felt like an eternity but it probably lasted a good 30 [[05:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18866.9s)]
*  seconds to a minute and it was pretty scary to be honest with you. I haven't felt that in a long time. [[05:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18872.34s)]
*  I was going to say if you've grown up in California of course you are alert to earthquakes [[05:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18879.300000000003s)]
*  but that's not necessarily the case for people who live in Thailand. No I could instantly hear [[05:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18884.5s)]
*  the screams from my neighbours. The whole building just erupted in a frantic screaming [[05:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18891.38s)]
*  and I was like oh okay. Me I was kind of alright I've been through this before no big deal. I'm an [[05:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18896.74s)]
*  old hat so to speak and yeah the Thais are not used to this at all. This was a very traumatic [[05:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18902.02s)]
*  experience to say the least for them. And what was the mood amongst the other people when you [[05:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18909.54s)]
*  got out on the streets? I guess I'm a knucklehead because I just stayed in my room and then I had [[05:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18915.54s)]
*  my fiance call me and said there's going to be an aftershock you need to get out. I was like [[05:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18923.46s)]
*  okay so I grabbed my cash and I grabbed my passport and just some basic stuff and I went [[05:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18929.14s)]
*  downstairs and everybody. The Thais are very happy people. That's why one of the reasons I live here. [[05:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18935.3s)]
*  The country is a great country to live in and I've never seen the look of shock and you know [[05:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18941.22s)]
*  of just utter I mean just the best way to describe it was shock. I've never seen them [[05:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18947.14s)]
*  with a blank expression. They're always smiling. They're always a very you know great culture here [[05:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18952.18s)]
*  and I've just never seen them with that kind of blank shocked expression on their face. [[05:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18957.620000000003s)]
*  They're scared. They're very scared to be honest. And what is the mood now? We're a few hours now [[05:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18963.300000000003s)]
*  after the earthquake. Right now it's still a kind of a panic situation because the [[05:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18969.46s)]
*  my fiance works out at the airport and where she's at it's just sirens. I mean I think out [[05:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18977.62s)]
*  there got hit pretty hard. I'm on more the circumvent area kind of the touristy area I guess you could [[05:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18984.66s)]
*  call it and she's more out by the business side of it. I guess you'd call Don Mung. It's the airport [[05:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18989.14s)]
*  out there and she sent me a video and it's just pure like everybody sitting on the ground and [[05:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=18995.38s)]
*  all you hear sirens. So you know that's not a good sign when you hear that you know. But yeah the [[05:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19001.14s)]
*  overall feeling still right now I can look out and most of the people are still outside. They're [[05:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19007.3s)]
*  still pretty scared to be honest with you. So you're the hard man inside while they're outside. [[05:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19012.260000000002s)]
*  I you know I'm like I said I've been through this before and you know the building I'm in I don't [[05:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19018.5s)]
*  know if I'd be in the same situation if I was in a 30 or 40 story building with you know like you [[05:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19024.26s)]
*  just interviewed the last guy and those pools were rocking. I just got out of the swimming pool at my [[05:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19028.019999999997s)]
*  gym which is an infinity pool two hours ago and that would probably not been good for me. I mean [[05:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19032.579999999998s)]
*  after seeing some of those pools splashing over the edges you know. Yeah I guess I dodged a bullet [[05:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19037.859999999997s)]
*  on that one. Jonathan thank you very much for describing your experience out there in Bangkok. [[05:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19044.42s)]
*  Appreciate your time. Let's get a little bit more detail about where it struck and the details. [[05:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19050.82s)]
*  Our science reporter Esme Stallard is in the newsroom with more. So Esme talk us through what we [[05:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19055.94s)]
*  know has happened. So there was this 7.7 earthquake what do we mean by that? That's a measure of [[05:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19062.02s)]
*  momentum. Effectively it's a measure of how much movement there has been in the top layer of the [[05:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19068.26s)]
*  earth and what size has moved. So the earth's crust is split into lots of different plates and [[05:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19072.739999999998s)]
*  they're all moving constantly. And my my is that the confluence of four of these plates and so it's [[05:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19078.18s)]
*  a very tectonically active region. So we had the main earthquake that occurred about 6.30 gmt around [[05:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19083.62s)]
*  lunchtime local time and then there was a series of aftershocks which then occurred affecting the [[05:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19090.66s)]
*  neighboring countries. But I want to talk a little bit more about that tectonic plate movement that [[05:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19096.18s)]
*  I mentioned. I'm just going to show you this map here behind me which is from the US Geological [[05:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19101.54s)]
*  Survey and the dot here highlighted in blue was that first initial earthquake that I mentioned. [[05:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19106.5s)]
*  But then what happens when you get that movement then settling is that you get then these aftershocks. [[05:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19112.98s)]
*  For example there was another one here just south just 10 minutes later which occurred. [[05:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19118.02s)]
*  Again that was very significant it was more than six on that same scale. Now when I mentioned before [[05:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19122.58s)]
*  those plates what we can see here is we can see a major red line coming down close to where the [[05:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19128.74s)]
*  earthquakes occurred. That's a major fault line so that's where some of that movement is happening [[05:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19133.940000000002s)]
*  and the US Geological Survey says that the kind of conditions or characteristics of this earthquake [[05:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19139.14s)]
*  suggest that maybe some of that movement was occurring along that fault line. That's known [[05:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19144.74s)]
*  as the Seagate fault and it's named after the area local to it. And then either side you've got here [[05:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19149.46s)]
*  the Indian plate and then over here the Eurasian plate and they're also moving. And so this is why [[05:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19155.46s)]
*  this area is very prone to earthquakes but the sheer scale of it is quite unusual. [[05:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19161.06s)]
*  The reason that we think it was so significant is that this earthquake [[05:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19166.18s)]
*  happened a very low area below the crust. It was only 10 kilometers down. That's a very shallow [[05:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19170.420000000002s)]
*  earthquake and that means when you get a lot of that movement between the plates it really has [[05:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19175.86s)]
*  a big effect on the surface. In terms of can we look at previous earthquakes can they indicate [[05:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19180.5s)]
*  potentially the scale? When we look at other earthquakes of this size we have seen significant [[05:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19186.34s)]
*  fatalities and I think that is why it's such a concern for local authorities and rescue services [[05:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19191.86s)]
*  at this time. There's also you know mentioned just there the concern about further aftershocks so [[05:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19197.3s)]
*  we've seen some more. Those are the other orange dots here occurring so there is still the risk [[05:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19202.9s)]
*  at this time that there will be further earthquakes felt but you can understand considering the kind [[05:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19207.62s)]
*  of surround in geology why this occurred. Jack I understand you're still stuck on the road just [[05:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19213.22s)]
*  describe what happened. Well yeah I just left my office and I was driving to visit a client [[05:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19219.300000000003s)]
*  for a 2pm appointment and around about 1.30 initially I thought I had a puncture in a tire [[05:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19226.100000000002s)]
*  because the car was sort of shaking a little bit and immediately I thought to pull over to the left [[05:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19231.7s)]
*  hand side and noticed all of the other traffic on the road was sort of driving quite haphazardly [[05:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19236.98s)]
*  and slowing down pulling in and it was only when I pulled the car in and put the car stationary I [[05:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19242.58s)]
*  realized the car was still moving around a lot and it was immediately at that point that I knew it [[05:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19247.460000000003s)]
*  was an earthquake which is strange because Bangkok doesn't really suffer from earthquakes [[05:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19253.38s)]
*  it's the first one I've ever experienced since living here more than 10 years [[05:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19258.5s)]
*  and I think people were taken aback by it they nobody was prepared or planned or really [[05:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19262.820000000003s)]
*  knew how to respond to an earthquake as the traffic sort of eased a little we tried to continue on [[05:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19269.06s)]
*  and just seen the building collapse right to the left of us there as you can see in the footage [[05:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19277.7s)]
*  and we were just shocked I mean as you as you can see by the footage that is just raw footage taken [[05:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19283.3s)]
*  by my girlfriend in the car at the time everyone was just absolutely shocked and parked up the cars [[05:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19288.34s)]
*  people got out of the cars just in in in fright really didn't really know what to do or you know [[05:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19295.7s)]
*  whether to just stop and wait on this elevated expressway whether to continue on and since then [[05:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19303.62s)]
*  it's just been absolute chaos I mean all of the high-rise condominiums hotels shopping malls [[05:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19309.54s)]
*  offices everyone had been evacuated for safety reasons and it's only around about now I think [[05:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19316.18s)]
*  that they're letting people back into these buildings so all of these people outside in 38 [[05:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19322.18s)]
*  39 degree heat obviously unprepared some people didn't have shoes on when wearing tops or t-shirts [[05:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19326.34s)]
*  didn't even have time to grab their things from their office and it's just been jammed on the [[05:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19333.38s)]
*  road since then we tried to turn around and head back to the office that was from half past one [[05:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19338.420000000002s)]
*  it's now half past six and I'm still not even 10 percent of the way back so Jack we've we have been [[05:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19342.66s)]
*  showing those very dramatic pictures of the moment of the collapse which you witnessed and [[05:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19350.66s)]
*  you're saying that it is chaos how far have you managed to get away from there in that in that [[05:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19356.18s)]
*  traffic jam probably about three kilometers four kilometers right three three miles or so and have [[05:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19361.62s)]
*  you ever you've been living there for a while have you ever witnessed any form of earthquake or [[05:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19367.78s)]
*  shock in the area none whatsoever so for me at first you know my immediate reaction wasn't [[05:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19373.78s)]
*  is it an earthquake that's why I thought it was the car but then when you when you're parked [[05:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19382.26s)]
*  stationary and you realize everybody is is also doing the same thing you just know there's an [[05:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19387.14s)]
*  earthquake and then I had a telephone call from my secretary saying are you guys okay there's an [[05:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19392.5s)]
*  earthquake going on and what have you so it was very very shocking indeed and my immediate reaction [[05:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19398.18s)]
*  was to think about the people in the construction site of that building that tragically collapsed [[05:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19405.62s)]
*  I mean it is a an active construction site and you know that there's going to be people in there [[05:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19411.78s)]
*  just to see that come down you immediately know there's going to be casualties and I think [[05:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19417.94s)]
*  even the latest news now there's still about 80 people on accounted for [[05:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19421.78s)]
*  yes we've been seeing the pictures from the scene of the emergency services there and as you as [[05:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19425.38s)]
*  you've been saying the traffic completely jammed in and around that area and as you mentioned 81 [[05:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19431.620000000003s)]
*  people the deputy prime minister saying trapped in the building what have the authorities been [[05:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19438.9s)]
*  saying particularly say on social media or has it just been a case of everyone's been using their [[05:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19444.02s)]
*  common sense to be honest I'm not 100 sure because I've been behind the wheel most of the [[05:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19449.78s)]
*  time I've only just swapped now to hold this interview and my girlfriend's driving so I haven't [[05:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19455.3s)]
*  looked on social media much but I have from what I have seen mostly a lot of people sharing their [[05:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19460.899999999998s)]
*  experiences damage the buildings that they're living in or the offices that they work at [[05:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19466.66s)]
*  cracks in walls and things like this and I think there's been a lot of concern of people [[05:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19471.379999999997s)]
*  wondering if the building that they're residing in or working in is actually safe [[05:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19475.14s)]
*  because aside from a collapsed building there's also damage to other buildings where you've got [[05:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19479.7s)]
*  these sort of two or three apartment buildings that have sky bridges and stuff that have been [[05:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19484.98s)]
*  detached or there's damage between the buildings so I think there's going to be some long-term [[05:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19490.739999999998s)]
*  structural damage that needs to be assessed and properly fixed [[05:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19495.62s)]
*  Fraser you're a reporter in making there just describe to us what the scene is there now as [[05:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19499.7s)]
*  it's beginning to get dark in Bangkok well yeah as you can see the sun is setting on quite a [[05:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19505.460000000003s)]
*  monumental day in Bangkok there's lots of people still milling around I think a lot of people [[05:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19512.980000000003s)]
*  don't really know what to do yeah like I said earlier I think that people in Bangkok are not [[05:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19518.74s)]
*  really used to earthquakes and so actually having the communication is coming through in dribs and [[05:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19526.1s)]
*  drabs and so there's a lot of people here there's maybe a thousand people still in this park [[05:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19532.899999999998s)]
*  but I did go out onto the streets about 20 minutes ago and Bangkok life seems to be resuming [[05:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19536.98s)]
*  we heard a little bit in what you filmed just describe the moment that the earthquake [[05:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19544.1s)]
*  happened and what you felt oh well there was there's that split second when you we initially [[05:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19549.38s)]
*  felt the tremor and you you pause for a moment because you don't know how big this earthquake [[05:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19557.78s)]
*  is going to be and I've been in a few earthquakes in different parts of the world but it was [[05:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19563.219999999998s)]
*  immediately clear that this was something big and something different and so panic set in pretty [[05:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19567.46s)]
*  quickly yeah everyone just rushing to try and get out I was on the third floor of a shopping mall [[05:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19572.98s)]
*  I ended up running down an escalator the wrong way people obviously panicking and screaming and [[05:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19580.899999999998s)]
*  then we got out onto the street and because you're in Bangkok the immediate thing to do is you look [[05:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19585.7s)]
*  up because there's so many skyscrapers around and yeah it was building swaying debris and also [[05:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19590.739999999998s)]
*  there was a swimming pool nearby that was overflowing as well and so [[05:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19600.34s)]
*  yeah it was it was pretty intense and Fraser what was other people who obviously have come [[05:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19603.7s)]
*  out onto the streets you've managed to speak to them what have they been saying to you [[05:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19610.5s)]
*  yeah I spoke to three young guys from the UK who are here on holiday they were in a hotel nearby [[05:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19615.38s)]
*  Sukhumvit road which is one of the main tourist destination tourist areas in Bangkok their hotel [[05:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19621.940000000002s)]
*  room they said the plaster was falling off the walls the whole building was shaking and so they [[05:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19627.94s)]
*  just ran out as fast as they could but obviously they couldn't use the elevators so they had to [[05:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19633.14s)]
*  run down run down flights of stairs I did actually also speak to a tourist from Myanmar in the park [[05:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19637.78s)]
*  that I've been in he's here with his elderly family and he's devastated of course just here [[05:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19643.62s)]
*  in the news coming out of that out of his home country absolutely so you've I've said that some [[05:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19648.98s)]
*  people are sort of deciding when to and if to go back into buildings I suppose the concern is [[05:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19654.98s)]
*  if there are any aftershocks yeah exactly I think that's what people are doing in this park you [[05:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19661.14s)]
*  know I don't know if you can see behind me but there's still a couple of thousand people in this [[05:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19667.3s)]
*  park that I'm at from a personal sense I guess it was lucky that I was so close to this park [[05:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19671.86s)]
*  but so many people in Bangkok you know there's just so many high-rise buildings and this very [[05:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19679.06s)]
*  little open space like I'm currently in just now so people are kind of seeking refuge I guess [[05:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19683.06s)]
*  yeah just letting the day sink in and just hanging out here until they as the night goes on that will [[05:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19690.5s)]
*  become a bigger decision for people to make in as it gets later yeah exactly I mean there there are [[05:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19697.300000000003s)]
*  not as many people as there there was earlier today when I first arrived here but there are still [[05:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19705.780000000002s)]
*  yeah quite a lot of people deciding to stay and wait on more news updates as they come [[05:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19710.98s)]
*  the Thai defense minister says 81 people are trapped beneath that rubble three bodies [[05:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19717.38s)]

*  wheel into the buildings that collapse you can see over there does supply of concrete from 30 [[05:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=19749.94s)]

*  on the streets so me and a bunch of people run across the road to a park and um and then i noticed [[05:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20072.26s)]
*  that the hospital was being evacuated and it was quite chaotic because they started bringing people [[05:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20077.94s)]
*  out in wheelchairs and stretcher beds but then they must have run out of wheelchairs and stretcher [[05:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20082.34s)]
*  beds they were carrying people out by their arms and legs and on people's backs so i ran in to try [[05:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20087.379999999997s)]
*  and help evacuate the hospital and um i i helped rescue one lady in a wheelchair get there outside [[05:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20092.26s)]
*  into the park and i went back to get someone else and then the security wouldn't let me in [[05:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20098.42s)]
*  but when i went back i saw that there was a car parked on the road like where i was running back [[05:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20103.379999999997s)]
*  and forth and there was about like 200 kilos of concrete and masonry had landed on the car [[05:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20107.46s)]
*  smashed all the front wings to the screen the whole bonnet was smashed in so it had obviously [[05:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20113.539999999997s)]
*  fallen from a great height and it was very clear that if anyone was in the way of that they wouldn't [[05:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20117.940000000002s)]
*  survive so um it was yeah it's quite intimidating to see that much stuff falling off the buildings [[05:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20122.420000000002s)]
*  have you been in an earthquake before i have actually yeah i was in a 7.9 richter scale [[05:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20128.98s)]
*  earthquake in india measure once before and that was i was right near the epicenter so that was a [[05:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20134.58s)]
*  lot stronger but um but there wasn't a lot of high-rises around there so i think actually i [[05:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20139.06s)]
*  felt safer in the 7.9 right near the epicenter than i did today in bangkok because there's a [[05:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20144.5s)]
*  lot of high-rises around me with projectiles falling off of how long did it last it lasted [[05:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20149.94s)]
*  i would say at least a minute so you know like it started when i was in this um this food court [[05:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20158.5s)]
*  and i had time to like get out of the food court get across the street into the park and the things [[05:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20165.22s)]
*  were still swaying i'd say at least a minute yeah i know and it's difficult i know from where you [[05:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20170.02s)]
*  are to give a sort of assessment but but news drifts in quite slowly at the beginning of these [[05:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20175.06s)]
*  sort of disasters do you get a sense that we don't know the half of it at the moment [[05:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20180.82s)]
*  yeah absolutely because like i can say i walked past uh about four buildings between where i kind [[05:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20185.62s)]
*  of helped to evacuate the building to the park and just along those four buildings there was like [[05:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20191.78s)]
*  hundreds of kilos and these were quite new buildings hundreds of kilos of concrete that [[05:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20197.7s)]
*  had fallen off from great height and landed on the street and i assume i can only assume that [[05:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20202.18s)]
*  that's it's a similar circumstance all across the city and this is a city of 17 million people with [[05:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20207.46s)]
*  thousands of thousands of high-rise buildings so i think it must be similar throughout the city [[05:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20212.58s)]
*  i assume and have you given thought as to where you'll go tonight what you will do [[05:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20218.34s)]
*  i'm sorry can you repeat that have you given any thought as to where you'll go tonight and [[05:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20223.7s)]

*  i want to sleep there tonight so i'm going to do a good walk around all of the car parks and the [[05:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20235.86s)]
*  structural areas that i can access and see if there's any cracks yeah that sounds pretty [[05:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20240.34s)]
*  sensible to me and just in terms of the the patients that were evacuated from the hospital [[05:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20244.9s)]
*  have they been taken back in or are they now being treated outside so there's about 100 people in [[05:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20249.54s)]

*  been cleared by the authorities as being structurally safe so they're actually going [[05:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20265.54s)]
*  to spend the night here and i know for a fact that there was two people had heart attacks just [[05:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20268.98s)]
*  during the evacuation so obviously there's there's a lot of risks that come with these [[05:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20273.62s)]
*  sorts of things that carry on after the initial event so all these people that should be in icus [[05:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20278.26s)]

*  well thank you for asking so um the country of miamara is actually prone to many natural [[05:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20781.46s)]
*  disasters it has hazards um recently uh as of last year large-scale flooding in the country we're [[05:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20786.82s)]
*  currently in the very hot season in miamara so that includes heat waves um that can reach up to 44 [[05:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20793.7s)]
*  degrees in some locations um the areas of the country that are most affected include the second [[05:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20800.100000000002s)]
*  largest city in the country and i am in yangon which is the largest city further south um was [[05:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20806.18s)]
*  also affected and we felt heard at midday and can you tell us how bad it was where you were what [[05:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20812.58s)]
*  what did you actually feel so immediately as in um earthquakes people generally doubt that what [[05:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20818.9s)]
*  they're feeling and then the uh response for us as the red cross is always with our emergency [[05:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20825.86s)]
*  response procedures to evacuate the building we're located within the miamara red cross society [[05:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20830.82s)]
*  building here in yangon all of us uh evacuated into the street fortunately there were no um [[05:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20835.780000000002s)]
*  actually no damage to the building or to any people within the building but we do understand [[05:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20842.02s)]
*  that this is something that we're trying to gain uh information on what has actually happened to [[05:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20847.7s)]
*  some of the red cross buildings outside of yangon the headquarters in nebido was slightly damaged [[05:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20852.98s)]
*  we know we know that in mandalay the emergency operations center of the miamara red cross society [[05:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20859.38s)]
*  was also damaged so we're looking at some of the local humanitarian responders are also themselves [[05:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20865.38s)]
*  affected by this earthquake and can you just give us a sense of how strong [[05:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20871.7s)]
*  the that the that earthquake felt i don't know if you've if you've experienced that before [[05:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20876.1s)]
*  but but what was it like to actually be in the moment yeah let's just say it was a very strong [[05:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20881.14s)]
*  feeling here in yangon and our solidarity for the people actually of miamara that been affected in [[05:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20887.3s)]
*  the northwest of the country if i myself felt it so much i can't imagine um the situation the very [[05:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20892.98s)]
*  serious situation that was felt in those areas close to the epicenter um when i say that i felt [[05:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20900.18s)]
*  it um it was several minutes of feeling it um we were still having uh evacuation from the building [[05:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20906.420000000002s)]
*  here in yangon and uh still feeling it and as i mentioned you know part of the evacuation procedures [[05:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20912.58s)]
*  is to stay outside the building for some time we could see in yangon that other people were also [[05:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20919.14s)]
*  concerned about the earthquake and how long that um the aftershock was then felt 12 minutes later [[05:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20923.38s)]
*  and the the authorities there have appealed for outside help they're saying they're opening up [[05:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20930.420000000002s)]
*  routes for people to donate and to get there they they say they're going to accept help from india [[05:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20935.86s)]
*  and from asian i mean the urgency of this i'm sure is incredibly stark to get to those people who [[05:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20941.22s)]
*  might be trapped yes it's incredibly important we have a small window of opportunity um and i [[05:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20948.66s)]
*  think that all of us as humanitarians as well as other institutions in the country are trying very [[05:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20955.46s)]
*  hard and probably will try until the very last possibility to reach those people um that are as [[05:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20962.26s)]
*  i mentioned um in collapsed buildings or in buildings that they're unable to get out of [[05:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20968.739999999998s)]
*  we also uh appreciate that there is that request for international aid this is something that we [[05:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20973.86s)]
*  and the red cross and red crescent movement are working together so this includes the international [[05:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20980.02s)]
*  committee of the red cross the international federation of the red cross of course directly [[05:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20986.34s)]
*  in support of the bmr red cross society and country can i just ask you really well very briefly we've [[05:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20990.74s)]
*  had one report which we haven't been able to check ourselves yet but um that the u.s geological survey [[05:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=20997.3s)]
*  might have indicated that the death toll could be really very high um that they're talking you know [[05:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21003.86s)]
*  potentially in the thousands do you have any information as to just how widespread the the [[05:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21009.14s)]
*  damage and the effects here might be so currently we're focused on the emergency responses you can [[05:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21015.38s)]
*  imagine so the numbers themselves um we don't have at this moment moving forward that's one of the [[05:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21021.46s)]
*  topics that we need to respond to looking at what the humanitarian needs are of the people that have [[05:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21027.38s)]
*  been affected um we're really focused right now on trying to get to the people in need and to respond [[05:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21032.5s)]
*  to the people that have lost their homes and have been deeply affected by this um unfortunate [[05:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21038.34s)]
*  disaster well marie manrique in yangon in miyamar thank you so much for talking to us today [[05:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21043.7s)]
*  let us go live to bangkok and speak to our news reporter lindell markwell and lindell just explain [[05:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21050.74s)]
*  where you are because you're just well in front of the building i think that we saw images of earlier [[05:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21056.18s)]
*  yeah i'm in chatuchak which is in the um the northwest of the city which is where this building [[05:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21062.66s)]
*  came down earlier today this was a construction site 400 people came to work here here this morning [[05:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21068.5s)]
*  and um more than 50 are still missing um when the earthquake struck the building is thought to have [[05:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21075.38s)]
*  come down within the first few minutes um this is the only building we know that has come down in [[05:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21082.82s)]
*  bangkok but there are many people still missing here today and the rescue work has now begun [[05:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21088.74s)]
*  they were waiting for quite a long time for diggers to come but you can see there that there are some [[05:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21093.54s)]
*  diggers on site now and very slowly they've been starting to work through the rubble [[05:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21099.300000000003s)]
*  and sadly we've we've now started to hear that some of the figures in terms of those who've died [[05:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21103.06s)]
*  we understand seven people here lost their lives and one also lost their life at another construction [[05:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21109.460000000003s)]
*  site nearby and the thai prime minister was here a few hours ago to see the work of the rescue [[05:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21115.54s)]
*  workers to talk about plans moving forward she also tried to reassure bangkok really to say that [[05:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21122.74s)]
*  the rest of the city's buildings are thought to be safe they believe that the other buildings in the [[05:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21130.18s)]
*  city were able to withstand this level of earthquake and people have gone back to their home [[05:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21136.82s)]
*  this evening but here tonight the rescue work is really just beginning and does the city have the [[05:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21142.98s)]
*  resources that it needs to do that work because obviously speed is incredibly important [[05:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21148.66s)]
*  absolutely i mean we've we've seen hundreds of rescue vehicles coming in here over the last few [[05:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21157.14s)]
*  hours um firefighters police so they've had they've set up a field hospital and they've had a [[05:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21162.98s)]
*  they've set up a field hospital they appear to be really getting everything in place to to help here [[05:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21170.18s)]
*  but around the rest of the city although we didn't see other collapsed buildings we have seen cracks [[05:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21176.58s)]
*  appearing in lots of buildings glass smashing and things like that and although you know people have [[05:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21180.9s)]
*  mostly returned to their homes many people will be quite concerned so the city have announced this [[05:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21185.7s)]
*  evening that they have 2000 or so engineers who volunteered to help there's going to be a hotline [[05:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21190.260000000002s)]
*  set up so if people see cracks are concerned about the safety in their building they can now [[05:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21195.46s)]
*  phone that in and the hope is that those things will be addressed but you know it's a big city [[05:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21199.54s)]
*  and and the real sort of level of damage still needs to be assessed and and just briefly i mean [[05:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21204.739999999998s)]
*  a lot of people must be worried about whether their buildings are safe because Bangkok [[05:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21209.62s)]
*  buildings wouldn't necessarily be built with earthquakes in mind in terms of their engineering [[05:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21213.7s)]
*  structures absolutely i mean this isn't in an earthquake zone and um i've lived here over two [[05:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21217.86s)]
*  years and haven't felt any tremors here before but there are regulations and in more recent years [[05:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21226.74s)]
*  those regulations have increased so i think the newer buildings are thought to be to be safer but [[05:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21232.66s)]
*  you know there will be buildings there are lots of old buildings here who might not [[05:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21238.74s)]
*  have been have the same earthquake standards when they were built so there are concerns and [[05:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21242.899999999998s)]
*  there's been a lot of confusion today but i think there's also probably relief that more buildings [[05:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21250.019999999997s)]
*  haven't collapsed here okay lindle markwell for now thank you very much indeed well we were seeing [[05:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21254.019999999997s)]
*  some of the live shots that we're getting from that scene let's talk more now about the earthquake [[05:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21260.82s)]
*  and we're joined by earth scientist professor tim right from the university of leeds school [[05:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21267.379999999997s)]
*  of earth and environment he is the co-director of the center for the observation and modeling of [[05:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21271.7s)]
*  earthquakes volcanoes and tectonics thanks for being with us can you just tell us a bit about [[05:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21276.58s)]
*  what we know about where exactly this earthquake happened and where it has spread to [[05:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21282.98s)]
*  yes so this earthquake in near the town of mandalay in in in miyamma and it seems to so one thing to [[05:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21289.14s)]
*  bear in mind for earthquakes of this size all earthquakes really they're not point sources so [[05:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21297.7s)]
*  they're not just like an explosion that just happens in one location earthquakes are caused [[05:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21302.34s)]
*  by flip on tectonic faults and to have a big earthquake you need a lot of slip on a long fault [[05:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21307.780000000002s)]
*  and the evidence we're getting from seismic waves from this event is that the earthquake fault was [[05:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21316.260000000002s)]
*  about 200 kilometers long so it goes to about 50 kilometers to the north of mandalay and about 150 [[05:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21322.34s)]
*  kilometers to the south and we'd expect really intense baking and damage unfortunately along that [[05:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21329.22s)]
*  entire zone and you know just to put that in perspective that's like it's you're getting most [[05:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21336.26s)]
*  of the way along the m1 from london to sheffield something like that it's a very large region [[05:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21340.82s)]
*  that's going to have been impacted by this devastating event and and do we know what causes [[05:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21346.1s)]
*  these movements yeah i mean if we take a step back ultimately they're caused by [[05:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21350.980000000003s)]
*  by the motions to tectonic plates in this particular region to the west we've got the [[05:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21356.18s)]
*  indian plate that's kind of ploughing north colliding with eurasia and that's creating the [[05:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21361.460000000003s)]
*  himalayas creating the tibetan plateau and and miyamma is essentially caught along the edge of [[05:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21367.22s)]
*  that and it's being kind of sheared so the west of miyamma is being pushed up to the north and a lot [[05:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21373.54s)]
*  of that motion it's about two centimeters every year on average something like the speed your [[05:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21380.34s)]
*  fingernails grow and a lot of that motion is taken up on this north south fault called the sagong [[05:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21386.420000000002s)]
*  sagang fault which appears to be the fault that slipped in this earthquake would you expect [[05:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21391.3s)]
*  further aftershocks or will most of those have happened by now we'd expect a series of aftershocks [[05:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21397.3s)]
*  now that will take place over many days months and indeed years following this event those [[05:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21403.86s)]
*  can be they're typically smaller than the first event but you can't rule out another large [[05:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21410.18s)]
*  triggered earthquake as well so many of your viewers will remember the the earthquakes that [[05:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21417.54s)]
*  we had in in turkey in two years ago there was a one earthquake was very similar to this one [[05:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21423.94s)]
*  ruptured 300 kilometers of a fault and then there was another earthquake very large earthquake [[05:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21430.5s)]
*  also happened within about 10 hours that's extremely rare but it's we can't rule that [[05:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21436.02s)]
*  out as well but there will definitely be ongoing smaller earthquakes that will continue for many [[05:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21442.18s)]
*  many months unfortunately and the epicenter as we know was in miyamma we are trying to get [[05:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21446.98s)]
*  voices from there but it's not easy when you look at the the measurements that we've got [[05:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21452.02s)]
*  what would be the impact for those who were perhaps you know most at risk of being at the [[05:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21457.14s)]
*  centre of this yeah i think it would would have felt extremely violent shaking if you're anywhere [[05:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21461.38s)]
*  near that 200 kilometer long fault and so that's likely to have caused significant damage it does [[05:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21467.460000000003s)]
*  obviously the impact of that depends very much on the type of building that you've got what people [[05:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21474.9s)]
*  are living in the one of the kind of tragic things that we can do quite quickly now these days is [[05:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21481.86s)]
*  make estimates of the number of people who might have been killed by an earthquake and we get those [[05:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21490.26s)]
*  first estimates within about 20 to 30 minutes and the US Geological Survey is one organization [[05:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21495.7s)]
*  that does that and they're estimating at the moment that there's a more than 50 chance of [[05:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21502.18s)]
*  there being more than 10 000 people killed by this event now i'm hopeful this will be smaller [[05:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21507.46s)]
*  than that and the earthquake was at midday and so it very much depends where people are what they [[05:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21512.9s)]
*  were doing we know that the turkey earthquakes one of the reasons they killed so many people [[05:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21519.780000000002s)]
*  two years ago was that it was in the middle of the night so many people were in their homes [[05:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21526.18s)]
*  when those buildings collapsed and midday is a is a better time of day in terms of casualties for an [[05:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21530.18s)]
*  earthquake and we're just seeing pictures that we've had in from mandalay which is obviously near [[05:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21536.66s)]
*  where this earthquake struck and we can see some of the damage there to the buildings [[05:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21543.94s)]
*  would you expect if tectonic plates shift in one part of the world like this does it have an impact [[05:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21550.34s)]
*  on other plates i mean are other areas which are earthquake prone also then at risk of some activity [[05:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21557.62s)]
*  or does this tend to be confined to this one geological area we we think there aren't very [[05:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21565.06s)]
*  long range interactions so we think that when you have an earthquake on a fault like this it will [[05:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21571.86s)]
*  affect the immediate region so you know within a few hundred kilometers of this fault will feel [[05:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21577.460000000003s)]
*  changes most strongly but ultimately i think you can think about these plates kind of slowly moving [[05:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21585.140000000003s)]
*  just continually moving and then they're just kind of stuck around the edges so those edges [[05:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21591.54s)]
*  start get stuck they build up stresses and then they fail periodically clean earthquakes and the [[05:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21596.58s)]
*  failure on one boundary of a plate doesn't necessarily impact the the earthquakes on [[06:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21603.14s)]
*  another boundary we don't think professor tim right from leeds university thank you so much [[06:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21610.02s)]
*  for explaining that for us thank you thank you around the world and across the uk this is bbc news [[06:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21614.58s)]
*  you [[06:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21621.54s)]
*  let's get some eyewitness idea of what went on at the time we can speak to travis leon he's a [[06:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21637.7s)]
*  content creator from ireland who is based in thailand he was up on the fourth year floor [[06:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21644.100000000002s)]
*  of his apartment block when the earthquake hit goodness me that must have been scary [[06:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21650.18s)]
*  yeah it was absolutely terrifying um i think most people like myself thought they were having [[06:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21655.62s)]
*  vertigo when this occurred i was sitting at my desk as i normally do work uh in the morning time [[06:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21660.899999999998s)]
*  and my chair started to swivel so i thought i was experiencing vertigo and i stood up and then my [[06:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21667.379999999997s)]
*  balcony door slid open and that's when i went outside to the balcony and had a good peek and [[06:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21672.26s)]
*  i could see all the water from the rooftop pool sloshing back and forth it was a real uh run for [[06:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21677.22s)]
*  your life kind of moment i've never experienced anything like that when you say it was a run [[06:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21683.14s)]
*  for your life moment were you a how did you get out well i'm up on the fourth day floor and [[06:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21688.260000000002s)]
*  you know having seen movies i just know the elevator is a no-go so i know there's an emergency [[06:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21696.34s)]
*  staircase and uh yeah it took me quite a minute to actually realize what was going on i've never [[06:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21701.300000000003s)]
*  experienced an earthquake in my life they're not very common here in thailand either so it was kind [[06:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21706.9s)]
*  of the last thing that i thought was happening but once i did realize um i ran outside my apartment [[06:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21711.38s)]
*  barefoot and i got into the emergency stairwell and i made my way down 40 floors and that took [[06:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21716.82s)]
*  about 15 20 minutes everyone was panicking running past me cracks were appearing down [[06:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21723.460000000003s)]
*  the side of the walls it was it was surreal um but yeah we made it down and everyone was you know [[06:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21729.54s)]
*  situated outside the condo and was the body was the bit because it's presumably it's an earthquake [[06:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21735.7s)]
*  proof building was that was it shaking was it swaying at the time you were running down the [[06:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21740.02s)]
*  stairs it was absolutely swaying yeah um that was the the most crazy part about it because [[06:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21743.7s)]
*  uh it was a sensation that you really not used to feeling especially on a high-up building the [[06:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21751.940000000002s)]
*  whole building moving back and forth and when i really realized this was happening was when i went [[06:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21757.940000000002s)]
*  out to the balcony and i was moving forward it's a big drop down below you can see all the way down [[06:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21762.660000000003s)]
*  you know everyone looks like little lego characters and once you look over and you could feel it going [[06:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21767.54s)]
*  forward i knew straight away i had to get out of there goodness me um so you get outside onto the [[06:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21773.38s)]
*  street yeah we're trying still to piece together the extent of the damage what have you seen as [[06:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21779.22s)]
*  you've walked around the city uh yeah so i didn't go too far from my condo but we i made it out to [[06:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21784.820000000003s)]
*  the street and you know instantly i knew what was going on especially when i saw everyone running [[06:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21791.22s)]
*  past me on the stairs that you know there are people who were running in panics and um you know [[06:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21795.38s)]
*  this this has not happened to this magnitude in thailand before so no absolutely no one was [[06:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21800.5s)]
*  expecting it um but yeah you know everything was built up in traffic what i did witness and i put [[06:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21805.780000000002s)]
*  in my tiktok video was as i was recording the video something fell from the building beside me [[06:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21811.780000000002s)]
*  and everyone ran screaming down the street once i got on social media you know i saw the horrific [[06:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21817.38s)]
*  scenes of buildings just completely collapsing you know they looked like it was a controlled [[06:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21823.3s)]
*  demolition they just fell right you know crumbled with nothing so you know that that was quite [[06:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21828.18s)]
*  tragic yeah that building in the northeast of the capital which we've been looking at yeah appalling [[06:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21834.34s)]
*  for the workers that were on that so it looks to me like you're back in the flat i'm back yeah we [[06:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21839.620000000003s)]
*  we weren't allowed in for it must have been about three or four hours [[06:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21846.82s)]
*  we were all waiting for updates from the juristic building management [[06:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21850.58s)]
*  and they they were basically unaware of whether these aftershocks were coming or not how strong [[06:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21855.54s)]
*  they would be so we had to wait for that and also they had to do the mandatory checks you know is [[06:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21860.58s)]
*  there any gas leaks is the electric you know circuit's okay all these kind of little things [[06:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21865.46s)]
*  to ensure that the building's safe because as you can massive and they're filled with hundreds of [[06:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21870.5s)]
*  people so yeah obviously we had to make sure they were fine but eventually we got back in [[06:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21874.98s)]
*  the lifts still do not work the electricity is still not the power is not back up no i thought [[06:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21879.78s)]
*  you were in the dark i didn't know whether you were doing it for effect but i i i guess that the [[06:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21885.62s)]
*  power wasn't wasn't on um so so i mean you're a long way up are you feeling a bit anxious [[06:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21890.02s)]
*  um not anymore not anymore i mean god there could be there could be after tremors but from what i've [[06:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21897.78s)]
*  seen online they've they've they've already [[06:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21902.98s)]
*  required miniscule now what i've read again online is they can occur within weeks or months after [[06:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21916.26s)]
*  i don't know if this is a new thing we have to get used to now but it certainly has made me [[06:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21922.899999999998s)]
*  rethink about getting an apartment with a nice view [[06:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21927.54s)]
*  you well i'm glad you got out safely and i'm uh it's really good of you to come and talk to us [[06:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21929.86s)]
*  after after such a day uh thank you very much uh sleep well i was going to sleep very well tonight [[06:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21937.06s)]
*  we've got um you know we've got a couple cans here so we're going to relax in our [[06:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21943.38s)]
*  and uh you know with our candle light here oh right so you're well equipped very good [[06:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21947.54s)]
*  travis it's good to talk to you thank you for coming on the program lovely let's get more from [[06:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21955.06s)]
*  esmé starr who's here and can give us a broader idea of the the map and and and where thailand [[06:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21958.9s)]
*  is in relation to the plates esmé exactly so if we just start from the beginning so we had this [[06:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21965.3s)]
*  earthquake at 6 20 gmt around lunchtime local time and it occurred here near sagay in mayanmar [[06:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21970.82s)]
*  now that's in a thousand kilometers away from bangkok but this was such a big earthquake that [[06:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21978.579999999998s)]
*  it was felt as far away as that now i'm gonna i'm gonna now show you some of the other aftershocks [[06:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21982.98s)]
*  that happen so this is a map from the u.s geological survey so they are the u.s government [[06:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21988.42s)]
*  science arm that monitors earthquakes and there was this first one that one that i mentioned there [[06:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21993.379999999997s)]
*  but then later just 12 minutes afterwards there was another one just south of it which is also [[06:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=21998.1s)]
*  very significant and a series of other ones in the north now why are they occurring in this region [[06:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22002.899999999998s)]
*  well that's to do with the different plate boundaries that are here so the earth is covered [[06:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22009.059999999998s)]
*  across and that is split into lots of different plates and they're constantly moving past or [[06:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22014.26s)]
*  below or above each other and sometimes when they get stuck a lot of friction builds up and [[06:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22018.579999999998s)]
*  that gets released as a huge amount of energy in earthquakes now mayanmar is in a very active zone [[06:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22023.379999999997s)]
*  the indian plate is down here the eurasian plate up here they are colliding and then there is a big [[06:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22029.62s)]
*  fault zone here the sagay fault now the friction we think has built up along that fault and as it [[06:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22034.899999999998s)]
*  got released it created this earthquake now you can see on this map how far away bang earthquake [[06:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22040.5s)]
*  it was the other thing we're quite concerned about is even though we expect earthquakes in this area [[06:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22046.1s)]
*  it was very shallow so it was only about 10 kilometers below the surface that means it can [[06:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22051.06s)]
*  going to be felt quite significantly there the other thing the reason we think it was felt so [[06:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22056.34s)]
*  far away is that this fault line is actually quite straight which means the energy can really travel [[06:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22060.9s)]
*  down it to other countries now we haven't heard that much about what's actually happening on the [[06:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22066.02s)]
*  ground in mayanmar obviously we know that's because some of the telegraph lines are down [[06:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22071.3s)]
*  but i think we can take from what's happening in bangkok as evidence of how serious this is [[06:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22075.62s)]
*  and the u.s geological survey who i mentioned before said for an earthquake of this size [[06:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22080.100000000002s)]
*  we could be looking at deaths in excess of tens of thousands of people so it is quite concerning [[06:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22085.06s)]
*  at the moment christian the military junta in mayanmar says according to their latest information [[06:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22090.74s)]
*  144 people have been killed with 732 injured in the earthquake that has hit the country of those [[06:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22095.62s)]
*  who died they say 96 people were in napidur 18 in sagang and 30 in mandalay well the military junta [[06:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22102.899999999998s)]
*  chief is now inviting help from any country and any organization saying they have opened up routes [[06:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22110.02s)]
*  for international assistance they've permitted india and asian to help a state of emergency is [[06:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22115.219999999998s)]
*  in place across many parts of southeast asia after that earthquake shook miyanmar thailand [[06:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22121.140000000003s)]
*  and parts of southwest china the main quake came during the early afternoon local time and it was [[06:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22127.06s)]
*  recorded at a 7.7 magnitude and just six miles deep the epicenter was close to miyanmar's second [[06:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22132.260000000002s)]
*  city of mandalay well powerful tremors were felt 600 miles away in the thai capital bangkok [[06:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22139.38s)]

*  know has happened there well thank you for having me i can tell you for the red cross movement in [[06:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22171.780000000002s)]
*  country we consider this a serious humanitarian issue as you have just mentioned we're talking [[06:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22180.82s)]
*  about a 7.7 magnitude earthquake with aftershocks including one 12 minutes later that was 6.4 in the [[06:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22187.14s)]
*  same area and ongoing aftershocks including several hours later we know that for the red cross [[06:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22194.98s)]
*  the red cross immediately started responding the miyanmar red cross society has volunteers [[06:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22202.26s)]
*  throughout the country and so those volunteers have been engaged in search and rescue assessments [[06:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22207.38s)]
*  as well as to seeing how to support other needs that are emerging at this time [[06:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22213.22s)]
*  they're still engaged in what will be considered very rapid assessments on the ground and are you [[06:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22218.42s)]
*  able to give us an idea of what the casualty figures might be [[06:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22224.58s)]
*  um unfortunately at this time we're unable to know the casualty figures i think that this is [[06:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22230.980000000003s)]
*  something that we're still waiting for information from the field we know that there are humanitarian [[06:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22237.140000000003s)]
*  actors including the red cross that have immediately responded this is something it is now nighttime [[06:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22242.820000000003s)]
*  here we're talking 9 30 at night it's quite dark out we know that these local humanitarian actors [[06:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22248.34s)]
*  are still looking for people in buildings that have collapsed we also know that infrastructure [[06:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22253.46s)]
*  was largely affected including roads and bridges public institutions as well so this is something [[06:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22260.899999999998s)]
*  we understand as a very serious humanitarian crisis and disaster that will need a large scale [[06:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22268.18s)]
*  response and and we've had some initial figures from the military junta but obviously there's [[06:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22274.26s)]
*  going to be fears that those numbers will get much worse can you give us a sense of how difficult [[06:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22280.26s)]
*  it is for agencies such as yours and the authorities to get to the people who need help [[06:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22287.379999999997s)]
*  well thank you for asking so um the country of miamara is actually prone to many natural [[06:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22295.62s)]
*  disasters it has hazards um recently uh as of last year large-scale flooding in the country we're [[06:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22301.059999999998s)]
*  currently in the very hot season in miamara so that includes heat waves um that can reach up to [[06:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22307.86s)]
*  44 degrees in some locations um the areas of the country that are most affected include the second [[06:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22313.7s)]
*  largest city in the country and i am in yangon which is the largest city further south was also [[06:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22320.34s)]
*  affected and we felt the earthquake when it occurred at midday and can you tell us how bad [[06:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22327.86s)]
*  it was where you were what what did you actually feel so immediately as in um earthquakes people [[06:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22333.86s)]
*  generally doubt that what they're feeling and then the response for us as the red cross is always [[06:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22340.58s)]
*  with our emergency response procedures to evacuate the building we're located within the miamara red [[06:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22346.100000000002s)]
*  cross society building here in yangon all of us evacuated into the street fortunately there were [[06:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22351.06s)]
*  no um actually no damage to the building or to any people within the building but we do understand [[06:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22357.06s)]
*  that this is something that we're trying to gain uh information on what has actually happened to [[06:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22363.78s)]
*  some of the red cross buildings outside of yangon the headquarters in nepidro was slightly damaged [[06:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22369.14s)]
*  we know we know that in mandalay the emergency operation center of the miamara red cross society [[06:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22375.54s)]
*  was also damaged so we're looking at some of the local humanitarian responders are also themselves [[06:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22381.54s)]
*  affected by this earthquake and can you just give us a sense of how strong the that earthquake felt [[06:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22387.86s)]
*  i don't know if you've if you've experienced that before uh but but what was it like to actually be [[06:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22394.18s)]
*  in the moment yeah let's just say it was a very strong feeling here in yangon and our solidarity [[06:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22398.82s)]
*  for the people actually of miamara that have been affected in the northwest of the country [[06:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22406.1s)]
*  if i myself felt it so much i can't imagine the situation the very serious situation that was [[06:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22411.379999999997s)]
*  felt in those areas close to the epicenter when i say that i felt it it was several minutes of [[06:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22417.62s)]
*  feeling it we were still having evacuation from the building here in yangon and still feeling it [[06:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22424.579999999998s)]
*  and as i mentioned you know part of the evacuation procedures is to stay outside [[06:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22431.86s)]
*  rebecca this is an absolute tragedy for the country and it's made even more difficult [[06:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22437.78s)]
*  because of the political situation but we've seen this this unusual call from the military junta for [[06:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22442.100000000002s)]
*  international help yes it's unusual because when the miamara military seized power in a coup four [[06:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22448.260000000002s)]
*  years ago they effectively cut the country off from the international community so they're banned [[06:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22454.34s)]
*  foreign journalists they've made it very difficult for foreign aid agencies to work in miamara and [[06:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22460.74s)]
*  they've also made it very difficult for for local doctors nurses hospitals to operate and intimidated [[06:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22466.5s)]
*  local media so for them now to admit that they need this international help is a very significant [[06:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22473.620000000003s)]
*  moment but at the same time where i've been speaking with a number of aid agencies this morning [[06:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22480.58s)]
*  and they're saying that's a promise but what they want to see is that level of access because [[06:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22486.420000000002s)]
*  they're worried about their teams being intimidated by the military and not getting that level of [[06:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22491.86s)]
*  access that they need right now to deal with what is clearly a very bad situation and from what we [[06:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22498.100000000002s)]
*  know of the country which obviously has been under sanctions the economy has been struggling [[06:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22505.86s)]
*  how equipped do you think the junta will be to get to these difficult areas we've seen you know [[06:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22510.899999999998s)]
*  one bridge collapse but it's it's speed which is always so important in an earthquake disaster [[06:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22516.019999999997s)]
*  even before this earthquake the united nations was warning that a third of the country would need [[06:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22520.82s)]
*  aid this year you know millions of people have been displaced by this civil war and many of the [[06:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22527.3s)]
*  people that have fled the country are doctors and nurses people might remember in the days after the [[06:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22534.26s)]
*  coup a lot of that civil disobedience movement people refusing to work wanting a return to [[06:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22539.54s)]
*  democracy that was led by doctors and nurses so the military has also targeted them forcing many [[06:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22545.22s)]
*  of them to flee so hospitals health care centers were already crippled before this earthquake so [[06:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22552.18s)]
*  the images that were getting out of miyam and they are limited are people on beds out in the open and [[06:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22559.14s)]
*  also hospitals have also crumbled in this earthquake mandalay we're hearing that as as well [[06:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22565.78s)]
*  so a very dire situation not a situation that the military can control and what about the fact that [[06:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22571.46s)]
*  some areas obviously have got big opposition numbers the opposition is fractured there's [[06:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22578.899999999998s)]
*  multiple groups aren't there will the military go into those areas will there be cooperation [[06:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22583.219999999998s)]
*  will international aid agencies been allowed into those areas that's right i mean here on verify we [[06:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22589.379999999997s)]
*  did a data project not that long ago looking at who controls miyam and we found that the military [[06:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22593.94s)]
*  has only total control of less than a quarter of the country and particularly this epicenter area [[06:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22600.1s)]
*  sagai when we looked at that it is literally a patchwork of control so different groups pro [[06:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22606.26s)]
*  democracy groups are called the people's defense forces also of course the cities controlled by [[06:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22612.02s)]
*  the military so that also makes a very complex picture the people's defense forces the national [[06:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22617.059999999998s)]
*  unity government have come out in the last few hours and said that they're also carrying out [[06:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22622.420000000002s)]
*  rescue operations trying to get aid to people the military is doing the same but we're hearing from [[06:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22627.38s)]
*  people on the ground my colleagues in bbc burmese just got through to some people in mandalay [[06:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22632.82s)]
*  they're not seeing any aid or recovery effort coming they're saying we've seen lots of buildings [[06:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22637.54s)]
*  crumbled people are trapped inside and no one is coming to help them and rebecca we saw the u.s [[06:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22643.54s)]
*  geological survey saying that given the the sort of huge depth of this earthquake the the size of [[06:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22649.7s)]
*  it it was it was actually shallow but it was very strong that obviously potentially the numbers [[06:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22657.54s)]
*  affected and killed could be very very high we don't know that yet but what are you hearing about [[06:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22661.62s)]
*  the potential impact yes the figures that we've received from the military government seem low [[06:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22666.02s)]
*  looking at the devastation the images that we're getting through and from some of these people [[06:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22671.7s)]
*  that we've been able to reach in mandalay they said the city is is a tragic scene someone used [[06:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22676.9s)]
*  that word that there's rubble everywhere that there isn't a recovery effort going on if you [[06:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22683.54s)]
*  look in stark contrast to the images we're getting from thailand it's a very different picture so [[06:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22689.780000000002s)]
*  it seems very likely that this death toll will rise and do we know if other countries come in [[06:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22695.86s)]
*  obviously china has been you know supportive of to a degree of this military junta will they be [[06:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22703.46s)]
*  sending help india's offered help and they the junta so they'll accept it and from asia how [[06:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22710.82s)]
*  quickly can those teams get in and how free do you think those countries will be allowed to be [[06:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22715.3s)]
*  well the united nations has also said it's preparing efforts now to get in i think we'll [[06:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22721.54s)]
*  have to see i mean the miyamah military is saying they they want aid but what as we've seen it it's [[06:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22727.940000000002s)]
*  a vacuum they've been cut off from the world now for for four years i mean china's got some [[06:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22734.34s)]
*  relationship with the military but again it's very limited and huge areas of those border regions are [[06:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22739.54s)]
*  now controlled by ethnic rebels so it's a complex picture for aid agencies to get into but the next [[06:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22744.420000000002s)]
*  24 hours will really be key all the aid agencies are saying we need to get in now if we're going [[06:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22750.34s)]
*  to save lives and and are there any other nations which have got influence and who the junta might [[06:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22756.74s)]
*  trust to go in and help you've mentioned the key to that's china and india that they have some [[06:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22761.460000000003s)]
*  influence asian has tried to have influence but that relationship since the junta took power has [[06:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22767.22s)]
*  been strained thailand of course will be key so i think aid agencies is saying they're ready these [[06:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22772.9s)]
*  neighboring countries are saying that they're ready will come in and help but it's a very complex [[06:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22778.820000000003s)]
*  picture that they're coming into this is a civil war and sagai has been a key battleground in [[06:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22783.94s)]
*  this civil war so the military just recently has been carrying air strikes out so bombing key [[06:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22789.3s)]
*  infrastructure bridges and roads and then you've also got this patchwork of civilian resistance [[06:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22794.739999999998s)]
*  groups so so one of the aid workers as i was talking to is saying you face intimidation from [[06:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22800.579999999998s)]
*  different groups and you need to negotiate that to get aid to people and can the un be trusted [[06:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22806.66s)]
*  do you think i mean if the un is going to go in we saw the didn't the un this week actually say [[06:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22814.34s)]
*  that they were going to to cut the level of food aid to about a million people there but will the [[06:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22818.34s)]
*  junta you know at this stage if they're facing a really big crisis think they have got to turn [[06:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22823.06s)]
*  externally and trust people because what what are they you know practically afraid of if other [[06:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22828.579999999998s)]
*  countries go in well they the miyami military is losing this war they are losing control of the [[06:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22832.9s)]
*  country so they are afraid of outside influence on that resistance and also people knowing what's [[06:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22839.86s)]

*  people's defense forces so these are local communities made up of models actors students [[06:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22919.940000000002s)]
*  people who never believed that they would turn into militia fighters effectively these were [[06:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22927.38s)]
*  students who protested for democracy so you've got those groups particularly in sagai where this [[06:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22932.5s)]

*  going to be for the military junta to get where they need to at speed oh it's going to be a big [[06:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22984.26s)]
*  challenge for everybody to be honest with you i hope things have changed since since i was in [[06:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22991.94s)]
*  miyama after the cyclone because it was definitely the most challenging place i've ever worked [[06:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=22998.42s)]
*  access to the authorities in a in a in an efficient way is extremely difficult [[06:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23004.66s)]
*  they don't make life easy for you the communications around the country is [[06:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23013.78s)]
*  uh is compromised transport it's difficult to get some effective people to come and work for you [[06:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23019.059999999998s)]
*  um it's all sorts of hazards yes i mean we did hear that um the the power was affected maybe [[06:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23026.26s)]
*  some of it has been reconnected but in in these very first few critical hours can you explain for [[06:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23033.219999999998s)]
*  us what different groups will be doing how exactly will people be trying to move in and help well the [[06:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23040.02s)]
*  the rescue phase comes first that's where we are now so getting international search and rescue teams [[06:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23046.98s)]
*  into in country um it's going to be the first job it's likely that regional teams from japan [[06:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23053.46s)]
*  china singapore will be getting there first and those are the ones that are most likely to to [[06:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23061.379999999997s)]
*  save lives to be honest with you and we've heard as he came to buy the military junta but they have [[06:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23068.42s)]
*  to get in within hours don't they because we we know that for survivors that's the most critical [[06:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23076.5s)]
*  thing and if the roads and bridges are affected how do those teams move around well that's this [[06:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23081.7s)]
*  is going to be extremely difficult they'll most likely head for yangon um because it's got the [[06:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23088.100000000002s)]
*  biggest airport there and the most resources and i heard mandalay airport's been closed as well [[06:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23093.86s)]
*  so they'll most likely head for yangon and so sort of muster there and try and find ways of getting [[06:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23100.34s)]
*  from there up to up to mandalay either by by road or um or by onward um aircraft transport transfers [[06:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23107.14s)]
*  we know of course that one of donald trump's first actions when he came to office was to cut us [[06:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23117.3s)]
*  aid will that have an impact on on the help that is given here well us aid was traditionally a [[06:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23123.22s)]
*  major player in the disaster relief theater and um they would always they would task the u.s [[06:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23130.82s)]
*  military to to help them and they were the the major player to be honest with you they had all [[06:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23138.66s)]
*  the assets um so you know now it remains to be seen whether they will come and help they would [[06:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23144.739999999998s)]
*  usually put in a um uh an aircraft carrier offshore and fly in with helicopters they they carry [[06:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23150.98s)]
*  relief goods on board the fleet um so those would be the traditionally that the first one of the [[06:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23160.26s)]
*  first people that you would expect in after a disaster such as this and if they are not [[06:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23166.98s)]
*  doing that role now or any other countries are able to to take that role instead well i suspect [[06:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23173.62s)]
*  china will step in uh japan i know are well equipped uh singapore i mentioned india as well [[06:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23180.58s)]
*  they're the the regional players that will come in australia new zealand still quite a long way [[06:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23187.3s)]
*  away and um uh although they they will probably be in the second wave if if um you know if petrol [[06:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23192.1s)]
*  is rationed if there's no internet so so communications is difficult how do how do the [[06:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23199.62s)]
*  teams on the ground from all these different agencies and groups how do they coordinate [[06:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23206.660000000003s)]
*  where to go and what to do well as a united nations agency otter is responsible for for [[06:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23210.820000000003s)]
*  coordinating the the rescue effort the united nations has a compound in um in yangon or at [[06:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23218.260000000002s)]
*  least it did um which will be the coordinating body they're well trained and set up for uh for [[06:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23226.100000000002s)]
*  this activity and um i trust that they'll be there and with world food program as well another [[06:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23232.66s)]
*  major player uh with the logistics cluster who will um be on site pretty quickly i would think to [[06:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23238.82s)]
*  coordinate everybody uh in their efforts you say if you say if petrol and uh communications are [[06:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23246.66s)]
*  rationed well i petrol is is um is is severely limited in uh in the country as far as i know [[06:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23254.02s)]
*  where they use the lack of petrol to stop people moving around and i think it'll find i think the [[06:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23261.22s)]
*  the the uh NGOs will find it extremely difficult to just hire a truck and get it to take you up to [[06:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23267.7s)]
*  up country it's it's not it's not like that in miyanmar you uh you buy your petrol on the side [[06:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23276.98s)]
*  of the road most likely and um it's people are not allowed to necessarily travel from region to [[06:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23282.98s)]
*  region but there's that and mobile phones aren't as prolific as we expect them payment systems [[06:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23290.58s)]
*  um are not are not working there you you need to have dollars paying cash nice clean um clean [[06:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23299.22s)]
*  dollars uh to be able to to operate in the country and it's um it's going to be pretty tricky and [[06:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23306.5s)]
*  you said that also obviously the authorities when you were there obviously that you know didn't make [[06:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23313.38s)]
*  life easy as you're explaining um given the junta the military junta have appealed for [[06:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23318.34s)]
*  international help they're saying from any group and any government for donations and for help [[06:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23323.62s)]
*  do you think there is a hope that they will facilitate you know countries and groups now [[06:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23329.7s)]
*  well it's certainly unusual and and yes one should be hopeful however what what tends to happen in [[06:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23336.26s)]
*  these situations is that uh the the leaders at the top make a statement like this but they don't [[06:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23343.22s)]
*  necessarily uh let the command flow down the line so your customs officer won't necessarily [[06:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23349.22s)]
*  understand that he's allowed to let aid come through the airport um to to help everybody he [[06:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23356.9s)]
*  he may not have had those instructions and um it can be extremely difficult to to to operate under [[06:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23365.22s)]
*  a military regime such as this and and just you know getting in all the sort of heavy equipment [[06:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23372.58s)]
*  and the sniffer dogs how long do you think it'll be before we see uh these other countries being [[06:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23377.780000000002s)]

*  otherwise there's not much um not really much point in them going they they have a sort of 72 [[06:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23390.100000000002s)]
*  hour window to be able to um make some uh significant um life-saving activity so um [[06:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23395.94s)]
*  let's hope over the weekend they can get in but there'll be those regional teams i mentioned [[06:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23404.899999999998s)]

*  yeah i'm in Chatterchak which is in the um the northwest of the city which is where this building [[06:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23461.7s)]
*  came down earlier today this was a construction site 400 people came to work here here this morning [[06:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23467.7s)]
*  and um more than 50 are still missing um when the earthquake struck the building is thought to have [[06:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23474.5s)]
*  come down within the first few minutes um this is the only building we know that has come down in [[06:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23482.02s)]
*  Bangkok but there are many people still missing here today and the rescue work has now begun [[06:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23487.78s)]
*  they were waiting for quite a long time for diggers to come but you can see there that there are some [[06:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23492.98s)]
*  diggers on site now and very slowly they've been starting to work through the rubble [[06:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23498.42s)]
*  and sadly we've we've now started to hear that some of the figures in terms of those who've died [[06:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23502.1s)]
*  we understand seven people here lost their lives and one also lost their life at another construction [[06:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23508.579999999998s)]
*  site nearby and the Thai prime minister was here a few hours ago to see the work of the rescue [[06:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23514.58s)]
*  workers to talk about plans moving forward she also tried to reassure Bangkok really to say that [[06:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23521.940000000002s)]
*  the rest of the city's buildings are thought to be safe they believe that the other buildings in the [[06:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23529.22s)]
*  city were able to withstand this level of earthquake and people have gone back to their home [[06:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23535.940000000002s)]
*  this evening but here tonight the rescue work is really just beginning and does the city have the [[06:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23542.02s)]
*  resources that it needs to do that work because obviously speed is incredibly important [[06:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23547.7s)]
*  absolutely i mean we've we've seen hundreds of rescue vehicles coming in here over the last few [[06:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23556.34s)]
*  hours um firefighters police they've had they've set up a field hospital and they've been able to [[06:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23562.1s)]

*  but around the rest of the city although we didn't see other collapsed buildings we have seen cracks [[06:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23575.620000000003s)]
*  appearing in lots of buildings glass smashing and things like that and although you know people [[06:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23579.940000000002s)]
*  have mostly returned to their homes many people will be quite concerned so the city have announced [[06:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23584.5s)]
*  this evening that they have 2000 or so engineers who volunteered to help there's going to be a hot [[06:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23589.140000000003s)]
*  line set up so if people see cracks are concerned about the safety in their building they can now [[06:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23594.260000000002s)]
*  phone that in and the hope is that those things will be addressed but you know it's a big city [[06:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23598.58s)]
*  and and the real sort of level of damage still needs to be assessed and and just briefly i mean [[06:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23603.780000000002s)]
*  a lot of people must be worried about whether their buildings are safe because Bangkok [[06:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23608.660000000003s)]
*  buildings won't necessarily be built with earthquakes in mind in terms of their engineering structures [[06:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23612.74s)]
*  absolutely i mean this isn't in an earthquake zone and um i've lived here over two years and [[06:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23621.140000000003s)]
*  haven't felt any tremors here before but there are regulations and in more recent years those [[06:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23626.18s)]
*  regulations have increased so i think the newer buildings are thought to be to be safer but [[06:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23631.86s)]
*  you know there will be buildings there are lots of old buildings here who might not [[06:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23637.78s)]
*  have been have the same earthquake standards when they were built so there are there are concerns [[06:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23642.02s)]
*  and there's been a lot of confusion today but i think there's also probably relief that more [[06:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23648.98s)]
*  buildings haven't collapsed here let's talk more now about the earthquake and we're joined by earth [[06:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23652.18s)]
*  scientist professor tim right from the university of leeds school of earth and environment he is the [[06:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23660.34s)]
*  co-director of the center for the observation and modeling of earthquakes volcanoes and tectonics [[06:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23665.46s)]
*  thanks for being with us can you just tell us a bit about what we know about where exactly this [[06:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23670.82s)]
*  earthquake happened and where it has spread to yes so this earthquake has struck this region near [[06:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23676.9s)]
*  the town of mandalay in in in miyamah and it seems to so one thing to bear in mind for earthquakes of [[06:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23684.5s)]
*  this size are all earthquakes really they're not point sources so they're not just like an [[06:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23692.9s)]
*  explosion that just happens in one location earthquakes are caused by flip on tectonic faults [[06:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23698.02s)]
*  and to have a big earthquake you need a lot of slip on a long fault and the evidence we're getting [[06:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23704.26s)]
*  from seismic waves from this event is that the earthquake fault was about 200 kilometers long [[06:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23711.699999999997s)]
*  so it goes to about 50 kilometers to the north of mandalay and about 150 kilometers to the south and [[06:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23718.179999999997s)]
*  we'd expect really intense shaking and damage unfortunately along that entire zone and you know [[06:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23724.42s)]
*  just to put that in perspective that's like it's you're getting most of the way along the m1 from [[06:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23731.46s)]
*  london to sheffield something like that it's a very large region that's going to have been impacted [[06:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23735.86s)]
*  by this devastating event and and do we know what causes these movements yeah i mean if we take a [[06:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23741.219999999998s)]
*  step back ultimately they're caused by by the motions of tectonic plates in this particular [[06:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23747.78s)]
*  region to the west we've got the indian plate that's kind of ploughing north colliding with [[06:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23753.62s)]
*  eurasia and that's creating the himalayas creating the tibetan plateau and and miyamaha's essentially [[06:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23759.14s)]
*  caught along the edge of that and it's being kind of sheared so the west of miyamaha is being pushed [[06:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23766.34s)]
*  up to the north and a lot of that motion is about two centimeters every year on average [[06:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23772.42s)]
*  something like the speed your fingernails grow and a lot of that motion is taken up on this north [[06:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23779.14s)]
*  fault called the sagong sagang fault which appears to be the fault that slipped in this earthquake [[06:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23784.1s)]
*  would you expect further aftershocks or will most of those have happened by now [[06:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23789.86s)]
*  we'd expect a series of aftershocks now that will take place over many days months and indeed years [[06:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23795.059999999998s)]
*  following this event those can be they're typically smaller than the first event but you can't rule [[06:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23801.86s)]
*  out another large triggered earthquake as well so many of your viewers will remember the [[06:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23808.9s)]
*  the earthquakes that we had in in turkey in two years ago there was a one earthquake was very [[06:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23816.9s)]
*  similar to this one ruptured 300 kilometers of a fault and then there was another earthquake [[06:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23823.38s)]
*  very large earthquake also happened within about 10 hours that's extremely rare but it's we can't [[06:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23828.02s)]
*  rule that out as well but there will definitely be ongoing smaller earthquakes that will continue [[06:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23835.22s)]
*  for many many months unfortunately and the epicenter as we know was in miyamaha we are [[06:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23840.420000000002s)]
*  trying to get voices from there but it's not easy when you look at the the measurements that we've [[06:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23845.300000000003s)]
*  got what would be the impact for those who were perhaps you know most at risk of being at the [[06:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23850.02s)]
*  center of this yeah i think it would would have felt extremely violent shaking if you're anywhere [[06:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23855.22s)]
*  near that 200 kilometer long fault and so that's likely to have caused significant damage it does [[06:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23861.3s)]
*  obviously the impact of that depends very much on the type of building that you've got what people [[06:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23868.739999999998s)]
*  are living in the one of the kind of tragic things that we can do quite quickly now these days is [[06:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23875.7s)]
*  estimate make estimates of the number of people who might have been killed by an earthquake and [[06:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23883.46s)]
*  we get those first estimates within about 20 to 30 minutes and the u.s geological survey is one [[06:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23888.98s)]
*  organization that does that and they're estimating at the moment that there's a more than 50 chance [[06:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23894.66s)]
*  of there being more than 10 000 people killed by this event i'm i'm hopeful this will be smaller [[06:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23901.14s)]
*  than that and the earthquake was at midday and so it very much depends where people are what they [[06:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23906.66s)]
*  were doing we know that the turkey earthquakes one of the reasons they killed so many people [[06:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23913.62s)]
*  two years ago was that it was in the middle of the night so many people were in their homes [[06:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23920.02s)]
*  when those buildings collapsed and midday is a is a better time of day in terms of casualties for [[06:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23924.02s)]
*  an earthquake and we're just seeing pictures that we've had in from mandalay which is obviously near [[06:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23930.34s)]
*  where this earthquake struck and we can see some of the damage there to the buildings [[06:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23937.7s)]
*  would you expect if tectonic plates shift in one part of the world like this does it have an [[06:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23944.100000000002s)]
*  impact on other plates i mean are other areas which are earthquake prone also then at risk of [[06:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23950.66s)]
*  some activity or does this tend to be confined to this one geological area we we think there aren't [[06:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23957.940000000002s)]
*  very long range interactions so we think that when you have an earthquake on a fault like this it [[06:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23965.3s)]
*  will affect the immediate region so you know within a few hundred kilometers of this fault [[06:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23971.06s)]
*  will feel changes most strongly but ultimately i think you can think about these plates kind of [[06:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23977.62s)]
*  slowly moving just continually moving and then they're just kind of stuck around the edges [[06:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23984.1s)]
*  so those those edges start get stuck they build up stresses and then they fail periodically [[06:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23989.06s)]
*  clean earthquakes and the failure on one boundary of a plate doesn't necessarily [[06:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=23995.460000000003s)]
*  impact the the earthquakes on another boundary we don't think [[06:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24000.82s)]
*  foreign [[06:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24019.06s)]
*  Hello, I'm Geetha Gorimuthi. Thanks for being with us. A state of emergency is in place [[06:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24139.06s)]
*  across in a huge swathe of Southeast Asia after a powerful earthquake shook Myanmar, [[06:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24150.86s)]
*  Thailand and parts of southwest China. The main quake came during the early afternoon. [[06:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24156.460000000003s)]
*  It was recorded at 7.7 magnitude and 6 miles depth. The epicenter was close to Myanmar's [[06:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24161.2s)]
*  second city of Mandalay. Powerful tremors were felt 600 miles away in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[06:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24166.82s)]
*  Authorities there have declared the city a disaster area. This building, which was under [[06:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24172.22s)]
*  construction, collapsed and searches are ongoing for dozens of workers who were in the building [[06:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24177.06s)]
*  at the time. The city's governor says many other buildings have been affected. Reports of damage [[06:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24181.38s)]
*  from Myanmar have been slow to emerge. This is the Ava Bridge in Mandalay. We will try and bring [[06:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24186.579999999998s)]
*  that to you. But Myanmar is a country that is currently embroiled in civil war. Earlier, [[06:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24193.02s)]
*  the ruling military did ask for international help, which is rare. Let's speak to Tintashwey, [[06:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24198.7s)]
*  who is a Myanmar political analyst and former BBC Burmese editor. Thanks so much for being [[06:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24205.54s)]
*  with us. Tintashwey, we've had some figures from the military of their estimates so far, [[06:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24210.82s)]
*  but the casualty figures thought to be rising. Just to bring people those numbers, [[06:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24217.7s)]
*  the military junta in Myanmar is saying at least 144 people have died and hundreds have been injured. [[06:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24222.86s)]
*  Just tell me what you have been hearing about what's been going on there. What we are seeing, [[06:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24229.54s)]
*  you know, from the footage that came from Burma inside the country and also the photographs we [[06:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24238.54s)]
*  received so far, short videos, the devastation is unprecedented. It is massive. And the earthquake [[06:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24245.62s)]
*  itself was very powerful. And we don't know how many casualty at the moment, but the government [[06:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24254.739999999998s)]
*  official figure is 144, as you said. That was this afternoon when the junta chief, [[06:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24260.3s)]
*  General, Senior General Mian Lai announced the figure. However, when I spoke to the people in [[06:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24267.579999999998s)]
*  Mandalay, and what we heard is as soon as the earthquake strike and the Mandalay General Hospital, [[06:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24274.300000000003s)]
*  there were at least 200 patients arrived, people injured and some casualty as well. But later we [[06:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24283.82s)]
*  heard that the hospital was so overwhelmed with the injured people. They are now sending some of [[06:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24293.14s)]
*  the injured people to other hospitals in the neighbouring towns and cities. And can you give [[06:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24298.86s)]
*  us a sense of what the buildings are like and how much they could withstand this size of earthquake? [[06:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24306.100000000002s)]
*  Mandalay is a very old city. It was an old capital. It has a lot of very, very old historic buildings, [[06:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24313.66s)]
*  a lot of Chinese investment in it in Mandalay. And I have been to a town completely built by [[06:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24325.34s)]
*  Chinese money. And those are the new structure. So the infrastructure is poor generally. But there [[06:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24332.579999999998s)]
*  are not many very high rise buildings. But given the scale of this earthquake, we have seen the [[06:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24340.34s)]
*  devastation, as I said, a lot of the whole road been completely destroyed. And there are [[06:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24348.66s)]
*  several towns and villages around the area which have been totally completely destroyed. [[06:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24354.620000000003s)]
*  So the infrastructure is poor and we do not have very high, tall rise building. But nevertheless, [[06:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24361.620000000003s)]
*  the scale of the devastation is massive. And yes, just to let you know, Reuters news agency [[06:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24369.9s)]
*  is reporting state media in Myanmar's capital saying that the thousand bed hospital there [[06:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24375.54s)]
*  in Myanmar's capital has sustained damage from the earthquake. That's obviously going to affect [[06:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24382.46s)]
*  their capacity to help the injured. Yes, the hospital in Nipidaw, the capital, [[06:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24387.02s)]
*  that had been affected by the earthquake. And we saw pictures of patients being taken out of the [[06:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24393.739999999998s)]
*  building and they were outside of the building. But not only the hospital in the capital Nipidaw, [[06:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24401.5s)]
*  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs been hugely affected by the earthquake and all the other [[06:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24408.300000000003s)]
*  ministries. The infrastructure there is not very good. And we also got footage of some of the [[06:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24413.100000000002s)]
*  building, including the military headquarters, been affected by the earthquake. Can I also ask [[06:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24421.58s)]
*  about the political divisions within the country? Because we understand that the military junta do [[06:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24427.58s)]
*  not fully control it. From what you have seen and know, do you think they will allow and give [[06:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24433.82s)]
*  aid and help to the areas which are under rebel control? And how difficult is it going to be for [[06:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24440.54s)]
*  external aid agencies to operate through the country in all these different areas? [[06:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24446.38s)]
*  We have so far seen the damages taken place in the areas that is not under the rebel control. [[06:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24452.7s)]
*  It's a major towns and cities. But what is so unprecedented is the military junta, [[06:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24459.74s)]
*  head of the military junta, he has requested for international community. He has requested the [[06:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24468.22s)]
*  international community to provide humanitarian assistance, not only the international community, [[06:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24474.620000000003s)]
*  anyone to please help us. So this is very unprecedented. So hopefully that now the [[06:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24480.22s)]
*  request is made officially and India is providing some humanitarian assistance [[06:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24487.34s)]
*  and International Red Cross is working inside. Hopefully the assistance provided by, [[06:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24492.94s)]
*  important assistance provided by these International Red Cross and other charities [[06:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24500.3s)]
*  will reach to the people who need help and support at the moment. However, as I said, [[06:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24508.38s)]
*  it is not under the resistance forces control area, the damages in the main cities and towns. [[06:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24514.54s)]
*  Okay, Tintar Shwet, thank you so much for being with us, [[06:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24523.02s)]
*  me and my political analyst, former BBC Burmese editor, very grateful to you for your time today. [[06:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24526.06s)]
*  Okay. [[06:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24573.98s)]
*  The Thai defence minister says 81 people are trapped beneath that rubble. Three bodies [[06:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24584.46s)]
*  have already been recovered from the site. With us to begin our coverage, this is Panisa Emojche. [[06:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24589.02s)]
*  She's a reporter for BBC Thai. Thank you very much, Panisa, for being with us. Tell us where you are [[06:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24595.739999999998s)]
*  as the sun starts to go down. I'm sure there are plenty of anxious people in the city. What does [[06:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24601.420000000002s)]
*  it feel like there? Yeah, so let's begin with Arm's Gamming on the bridge that actually located [[06:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24606.62s)]
*  near the collapsed building. If you can see behind me, this is more of the bird eye view [[06:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24612.94s)]
*  into the building that collapsed. You can see over there the supply of concrete from 30 story [[06:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24617.58s)]
*  buildings that collapsed. Next to that, you can see that it's about three story tall at the moment [[06:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24624.3s)]
*  and rescue teams have been going inside since early in the afternoon. We have felt the shakiness [[06:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24629.74s)]
*  of the earthquake at around 1pm Thai time and we already spoke BBC Thai and BBC already spoke to [[06:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24636.460000000003s)]
*  two of the workers who were actually in that building at the time that there were earthquake [[06:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24643.34s)]
*  and we feel the shaking and they were running for their life. And as you already mentioned, [[06:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24649.5s)]
*  at the top of that 30 story building construction, there were cranes and one of the Ives net, [[06:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24654.38s)]
*  the worker that survived from that collapse said that the moment he feel the shakiness, [[06:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24660.620000000003s)]
*  he looked back and he saw the crane on the top of the building was start shaking as well. [[06:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24666.460000000003s)]
*  He was just running for his life and for a split moment he thought he was being made with. So that's [[06:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24671.260000000002s)]
*  where we are. We've had a statement from the defence minister who says they've pulled three [[06:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24677.02s)]
*  bodies from the site. Do they have the teams on location at the moment and do they know about the [[06:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24683.18s)]
*  other eight or so people that are trapped beneath it? Yeah, so it has been reported that about 400 [[06:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24690.3s)]
*  people were working on the site and at the moment about 69 is still missing but you can see that the [[06:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24696.78s)]
*  rescue team is still going because it's already sunset and they've been setting light everywhere [[06:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24703.98s)]
*  to try to make sure that there rescues everyone. Let's talk about the wider situation. There is a [[06:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24709.74s)]
*  state of emergency in place. What does that mean in real terms? What does that enable the government [[06:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24716.460000000003s)]
*  to do? So basically with Bangkok, the Bangkok governor is basically one of the main ones but [[06:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24720.940000000002s)]
*  also every department that related for the government trying to do this and at the moment [[06:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24727.18s)]
*  we're sitting on the street that no particular ordinary car can walk by or can drive by because [[06:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24732.38s)]
*  this [[06:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24738.46s)]
*  the moments that led to the size of the collapsed building is already full of rescues and of [[06:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24750.86s)]
*  equipment to be used for this rescue team. So this emergency worker and also health rescue team [[06:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24757.5s)]
*  to make sure that they can do their job efficiently. So in terms of the critical [[06:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24764.22s)]
*  infrastructure, the transport links, the roads, the power lines, a lot of that information is still [[06:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24769.9s)]
*  coming in. They've not had many hours to get information from outside Bangkok but do we have [[06:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24774.620000000003s)]
*  a more considered assessment of how far reaching the damage has been? Yeah, so at the moment we [[06:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24780.300000000003s)]
*  still have internet and everything is still intact in line. Apart from this big collapsed building [[06:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24788.86s)]
*  and that's went online because of a very horrific scenes that everybody can see. There are also some [[06:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24794.3s)]
*  reports as well. There's some old buildings also have collapsed and also you can see some cracks. [[06:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24799.58s)]
*  A lot of veterans also show that their condominium or their apartment especially those with [[06:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24805.34s)]
*  tyroses, they start seeing cracks or windows start cracking down as well because actually [[06:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24810.62s)]
*  Thailand is really not familiar with this type of shakiness, with this type of outbreak. This is one [[06:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24816.78s)]
*  of the first time for many Thai especially those living in Bangkok to feeling this shakiness. I was [[06:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24822.86s)]
*  on the ground. I was at my house on the ground for the moment at 1 pm when it started to shake [[06:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24829.34s)]
*  and you start feeling thisiness to the level I never felt before. Right. What will people do tonight? [[06:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24835.26s)]
*  There'll be a lot of worry, a lot of fear in the city. We've seen pictures of people outside on the [[06:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24842.940000000002s)]
*  streets. I know people in Thailand are used to this sort of thing but are people still [[06:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24847.18s)]
*  feeling aftershocks? Is there concern there's more to come? Yes, people are still concerned. [[06:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24852.54s)]
*  Especially earlier than this because to be out earlier there's still report from an announcement [[06:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24858.06s)]
*  from the government that warned that there will be aftershock coming and it's been reported at [[06:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24864.06s)]
*  least eight aftershocks coming in and happened after that 1 pm from big earthquake and we can [[06:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24869.1s)]
*  see that actually around me, local citizens, local civilians still up here on the bridge along with [[06:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24875.899999999998s)]
*  all the media personnel to witness the list routine. So people at the scene at Chatuchak area was [[06:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24882.059999999998s)]
*  actually nearby the famous Chatuchak market for all foreigners that come to join Thailand. So we [[06:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24888.14s)]
*  still see people here want to know what happened. Some might fear but a lot of citizens also go back [[06:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24893.58s)]
*  to their house and stay informed. Mainly they're waiting for what to come next. What was the [[06:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24900.460000000003s)]
*  announcement from the government, the advice to do, the advice for them. The filmmaker Mik O'Shea, [[06:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24906.140000000003s)]
*  he was eating in a cafe when the earthquake struck and he rushed to help at a nearby hospital that [[06:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24912.06s)]
*  was evacuating its patients. I've seen some of those pictures actually. Where are you now [[06:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24917.260000000002s)]
*  and what can you tell us about the picture around you? Yes, I'm actually in a part of the King's [[06:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24923.58s)]
*  Royal Palace in downtown Bangkok which is attached to a hospital and they call the King Mongkut [[06:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24929.58s)]
*  Hospital and I happened to be having a meal there when the earthquake hit and like everyone else I [[06:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24935.660000000003s)]
*  rushed outside and to try and get away from the high-rise buildings because there was actually [[06:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24941.5s)]
*  masonry and bits of concrete falling off the high-rises and landing on the streets. So me and a [[06:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24945.420000000002s)]
*  bunch of people run across the road to a park and then I noticed that the hospital was being [[06:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24950.86s)]
*  evacuated and it was quite chaotic because they started bringing people out in wheelchairs and [[06:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24955.9s)]
*  stretcher beds but then they must have run out of wheelchairs and stretcher beds. They were carrying [[06:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24960.86s)]
*  people out by their arms and legs and on people's backs so I ran in to try and help evacuate the [[06:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24965.02s)]
*  hospital and I helped rescue one lady in a wheelchair get there outside into the park and [[06:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24970.38s)]
*  I went back to get someone else and then the security wouldn't let me in but when I went back [[06:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24976.22s)]
*  I saw that there was a car parked on the road like where I was running back and forth and there was [[06:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24981.100000000002s)]
*  about like 200 kilos of concrete and masonry had landed on the car, smashed all the front windscreen, [[06:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24985.5s)]
*  the whole bonnet was smashed in so it had obviously fallen from a great height and it was very clear [[06:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24992.460000000003s)]
*  that if anyone was in the way of that they wouldn't survive so it was yeah it's quite intimidating to [[06:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=24997.260000000002s)]
*  see that much stuff falling off the buildings. I imagine so. Have you been in an earthquake before? [[06:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25003.1s)]
*  I have actually yeah I was in a 7.9 Richter scale earthquake in Indonesia once before [[06:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25008.859999999997s)]
*  and that was I was right near the epicenter so that was a lot stronger but there wasn't a lot [[06:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25013.42s)]
*  of high rises around there so I think actually I felt safer in the 7.9 right near the epicenter [[06:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25019.019999999997s)]
*  than I did today in Bangkok because there's a lot of high rises around me with projectiles falling [[06:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25025.1s)]
*  off of. How long did it last? It lasted I would say at least a minute so you know like it started [[06:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25029.34s)]
*  when I was in this food court and I had time to like get out of the food court, get across the [[06:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25038.86s)]
*  street into the park and the things were still swaying I'd say at least a minute. Yeah I know [[06:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25045.02s)]
*  I mean this is a subjective question but and it's difficult I know from where you are to give a [[06:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25050.7s)]
*  sort of assessment but news drifts in quite slowly at the beginning of these sort of disasters. Do [[06:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25054.7s)]
*  you get a sense that we don't know the half of it at the moment? Yeah absolutely because like I can [[06:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25060.7s)]
*  say I walked past about four buildings between where I kind of helped to evacuate the building [[06:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25066.14s)]
*  to the park and just along those four buildings there was like hundreds of kilos and these were [[06:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25072.46s)]
*  quite new buildings hundreds of kilos of concrete that had fallen off from great height and landed [[06:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25078.3s)]
*  on the street and I assume I can only assume that that's it's a similar circumstance all across the [[06:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25083.02s)]
*  city and this is a city of 17 million people with thousands of thousands of high-rise buildings so [[06:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25088.46s)]
*  I think I assume. And have you given thought as to where you'll go tonight what you will do? [[06:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25094.38s)]
*  I'm sorry can you repeat that? Have you given any thought as to where you'll go tonight and what you [[06:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25100.54s)]
*  will do? The first thing I'm going to do when I leave the hospital here and get back to my apartment [[06:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25104.54s)]
*  is I'm going to do a bit of a structural assessment and figure out whether I want to [[06:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25109.66s)]
*  sleep there tonight so I'm going to do a good walk around all of the car parks and the structural [[06:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25113.02s)]
*  areas that I can access and see if there's any cracks. Yeah that sounds pretty sensible to me [[06:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25117.74s)]
*  and just in terms of the the patients that were evacuated from the hospital have they been taken [[06:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25122.46s)]
*  back in or are they now being treated outside? So there's about 100 people in this room behind me [[06:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25127.1s)]
*  and they are all the patients of the hospital there's over a thousand people evacuated most [[06:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25133.34s)]
*  of them haven't been let back into the hospital yet because it hasn't been cleared by the [[06:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25138.3s)]
*  authorities as being structurally safe so they're actually going to spend the night here and I know [[06:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25143.18s)]
*  for a fact that there was two people had heart attacks just during the evacuation so obviously [[06:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25148.059999999998s)]
*  there's a lot of risks that come with these sorts of things that carry on after the initial event [[06:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25152.94s)]
*  so all these people that should be in ICUs tonight they're actually in these makeshift [[06:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25158.38s)]
*  ruins outside of hospitals. A state of emergency has been declared across large parts of Myanmar [[06:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25162.94s)]
*  after a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake hundreds are feared to have died. The quake's epicentre [[06:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25169.1s)]
*  was near Mandalay home to one and a half million people heavy shaking also reported in Bangkok the [[06:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25176.059999999998s)]
*  capital of neighbouring Thailand and tremors were felt in parts of China, India, Bangladesh. Teams [[06:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25182.539999999997s)]
*  from the Red Cross are attempting to respond but facing challenges due to a lack of power [[06:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25189.26s)]
*  in the affected areas. Well it's now just after eight o'clock at night there in Bangkok these are [[06:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25194.059999999998s)]
*  the live pictures workers at the scene of one of the buildings that's collapsed. Graham Satchel has this. [[06:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25199.98s)]
*  The terrifying moments of building collapses in the Thai capital Bangkok. [[07:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25206.3s)]
*  Construction workers screaming and running for their lives. [[07:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25222.62s)]
*  The same moment was captured more than a mile away by a member of the public. [[07:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25231.5s)]
*  You can feel the panic and horror as people try to get away. [[07:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25236.94s)]
*  The high-rise building was reduced to rubble in just a few seconds. [[07:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25244.94s)]
*  Emergency services were on the scene quickly to help the injured but it's thought hundreds [[07:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25249.18s)]
*  of workers were on the site when the building collapsed and dozens may be trapped in the wreckage. [[07:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25253.66s)]
*  The moment the earthquake struck was caught on camera in this Bangkok office. [[07:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25259.260000000002s)]
*  You can see the building rocking backwards and forwards. [[07:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25266.46s)]
*  Almost immediately every office block in Bangkok started to evacuate. [[07:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25272.46s)]
*  People running down stairwells heading for the safety of the street. [[07:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25277.02s)]
*  A lot of screaming, a lot of panic, people running the wrong way down the escalator. [[07:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25281.58s)]
*  I hope you can hear me. Just checking whether that line is still there or has it frozen. Dr. [[07:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25289.02s)]
*  Qi Min, can you hear us? The picture is certainly frozen. I can hear you. Oh, wonderful. Thank you [[07:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25295.58s)]
*  so much. Sorry about that. We had to, sorry to keep you waiting for a few minutes there. [[07:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25304.54s)]
*  You're in Myanmar in Yangon. Can I just first of all ask you, did you feel the earthquake yourself? [[07:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25309.74s)]
*  Yes, I felt the earthquake myself this afternoon when I was in the office. We are on the fifth [[07:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25315.58s)]
*  floor of the building. It took around three or four minutes long. And what was that like? [[07:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25322.22s)]
*  At first, I thought I was having a dizzy spell and then later I noticed that the [[07:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25331.34s)]
*  furniture was moving, the building shaking and then we had the tremor. So it's confirmed that [[07:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25337.820000000003s)]
*  it's an earthquake. And I was waiting for the earthquake to cease, but it took around three to [[07:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25345.02s)]
*  four minutes. It's quite long for us in the tremor. And were you with others in the room? [[07:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25352.22s)]
*  How did people around you react? Yes, all the people around me, they were nervous and some [[07:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25357.98s)]
*  people are trying to go down because we suggested not to use the elevator. So they went down by [[07:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25366.7s)]
*  stairs and many people are outside of the building, but I decided not to go out. And if anything [[07:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25373.58s)]
*  happened, I would just hide under my desk. And are you still in that same building now? And is [[07:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25379.660000000003s)]
*  it safe as far as you know? I think, yeah, it's safe. I think so it's safe. And can you just tell [[07:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25387.260000000002s)]
*  us what you know about the level of destruction and the casualty numbers that you know of so far? [[07:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25395.660000000003s)]
*  Yeah, the destruction is more near the epicenter in the centre of Myanmar, especially in Mandalay [[07:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25403.660000000003s)]
*  and a new capital, Nui Bidaw. But we don't have any destruction in Yangon. But we heard from the news [[07:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25409.980000000003s)]
*  that especially the infrastructure, the road from Yangon to Mandalay is badly damaged. No car or [[07:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25418.780000000002s)]
*  buses can be able to go. And the another thing is the airport, both the Mandalay airport and the [[07:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25427.26s)]
*  Nui Bidaw airport are also affected severely. The runway of the Mandalay airport is also damaged. [[07:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25433.579999999998s)]
*  And in Nui Bidaw airport, the airplane controller, controlling tower is also collapsed and a few [[07:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25440.46s)]
*  people died from that. So the communication, transportation is very bad. And also the some of [[07:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25449.739999999998s)]
*  the building in Mandalay and also many building in the Nui Bidaw were also collapsing during some [[07:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25456.94s)]
*  hospitals and government offices. So the infrastructure damage is quite enormous. [[07:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25462.699999999997s)]
*  Do you have any sense of how many people could be affected here? Because we've had some figures from [[07:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25468.94s)]
*  the military leaders of 144 people who've lost their lives, sadly, over 700 injured so far. But [[07:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25473.899999999998s)]
*  do you think those numbers are going to go up significantly? Or is it difficult to assess that [[07:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25482.539999999997s)]
*  at the moment? I think it's difficult to assess that at this time. And also it might go up [[07:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25486.62s)]
*  significantly. So we don't know how many people might be trapped in the carless building. [[07:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25493.26s)]
*  And the other thing is not all the people injured or die are going to the hospital because [[07:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25498.78s)]
*  some might be in their own home for recovery and all that. So we don't actually know how many people [[07:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25506.539999999997s)]
*  injured or how many people died. And so, yeah, it's difficult to get the information. [[07:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25513.98s)]
*  On the other hand, also, I think the phone lines were also cut off after the earthquake. Only [[07:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25520.62s)]
*  in the evening it slowly recovers. So it's difficult to get information right away. [[07:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25529.98s)]
*  And are the phones now back up and running? I mean, have you got teams that are now going [[07:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25534.3s)]
*  trying to help people? I mean, are your teams able to operate? [[07:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25539.42s)]
*  Yes, we just formed the respond team. And the first thing we are now doing is to do the assessment [[07:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25543.579999999998s)]
*  like how many people affected, especially in our project area, because we have to start with our [[07:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25551.5s)]
*  project area where our staff are there. And then we will go to the outside of our project area. [[07:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25557.019999999997s)]
*  And we are having now compiling all our relief items, which could be ready tomorrow morning. [[07:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25563.66s)]
*  And are you in touch with other aid agencies? Because if you're saying that some of these [[07:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25571.34s)]
*  roads and the airports are damaged and not usable, that's going to make it difficult [[07:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25575.579999999998s)]
*  for international teams to come in, even though the military of Junta have appealed for global help. [[07:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25580.7s)]
*  Yeah, I think the international airport Yangon is still working well. It's not damaged. [[07:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25587.579999999998s)]
*  But yeah, we need to find out how the relief team from Yangon can go to the affected area. [[07:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25593.82s)]
*  And I hope that the runway damage can be repaired within days. So the [[07:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25600.94s)]
*  transportation will be back. But the road, the highway will take some time to recover. [[07:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25607.74s)]
*  How worried are you about what's happened here? So obviously, I'm sure been very alarming to be at [[07:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25618.14s)]
*  the centre of this. Yeah, the alarming things is we do not get exact information. So it's difficult [[07:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25622.86s)]
*  to assess the damage and also difficult to plan. But we just plan from what we hear from the social [[07:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25634.06s)]
*  media and all that. OK, Dr. Keemin, we're out of time. But thank you so much for being with us. [[07:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25642.06s)]
*  This is BBC News. Thank you. [[07:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25646.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25652.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25712.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25742.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25772.86s)]

*  Thank you. [[07:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25832.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25862.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25892.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[07:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25922.86s)]
*  Let's go back to the earthquake in Myanmar because we're still trying to get a sense of the scale of [[07:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25945.98s)]
*  what's happened. The internet was down. The power lines were down, although we have been [[07:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25951.260000000002s)]
*  able to get through on the phone to a couple of people in the last hour or so. We've also been [[07:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25955.02s)]
*  hearing from the ruling junta there who called for donations of blood and medical supplies [[07:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25960.22s)]
*  due to, as they put it, so many injuries in three urban centres. We've been looking at these pictures [[07:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25965.02s)]
*  of the Ava Bridge near Mandalay. This is the Saga region where some of the fiercest fighting [[07:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25969.98s)]
*  has been concentrated with those who are pitted against the junta. And there are 16 sections to [[07:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25974.78s)]
*  that bridge. This is the Irrawaddy River, which cuts the country in half. So we've been hearing, [[07:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25981.26s)]
*  of course, rivers also affected by the bridges and roads and airports, all affected by what has [[07:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25987.26s)]
*  happened, which will, of course, cause huge problems for rescue workers trying to get to people to help [[07:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=25994.78s)]
*  them. Well, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said that the UN is mobilising to help [[07:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26001.02s)]
*  those in need after that earthquake. A terrible earthquake has hit parts of Southeast Asia today [[07:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26006.46s)]
*  and we send our condolences to the governments and peoples of the region. The United Nations system [[07:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26017.420000000002s)]
*  is mobilising to help those in need. The government of Myanmar has asked for international support [[07:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26024.94s)]
*  and our team in Myanmar is already in contact in order to fully mobilise our resources in the [[07:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26031.98s)]
*  region to support the people of Myanmar. But of course there are other countries impacted, [[07:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26036.539999999997s)]
*  but the epicentre is in Myanmar and Myanmar is the weakest country in this present situation. [[07:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26042.14s)]
*  Antonio Guterres there. Well, our science reporter Esme Stallard is here with more details. Esme? [[07:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26049.34s)]
*  Great, thank you Guterres. I'm just going to take you through what happened from the beginning. So [[07:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26055.02s)]
*  there was this earthquake which occurred at 6.20 GMT around lunchtime local time in Myanmar [[07:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26059.02s)]
*  near Sige here. Now that first earthquake was a 7.7 on the scale that we used to measure earthquakes [[07:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26065.42s)]
*  and that was significant. But just 12 minutes later there was another earthquake that occurred, [[07:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26072.699999999997s)]
*  which was a 6.4 earthquake. And then there was a further five aftershocks in the neighbouring area. [[07:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26078.46s)]
*  Now we've highlighted those on this map here. There was one south and there was a cluster of them [[07:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26085.739999999998s)]
*  further north. But why did this earthquake occur? What was happening below the surface to create it? [[07:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26091.02s)]
*  So if we zoom back out here and we start to look at the tectonic plates. So [[07:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26096.78s)]
*  Myanmar is at the convergence of four major tectonic plates. That's where the earth's crust [[07:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26101.98s)]
*  is split into different areas and they're all moving in relation to each other. We have the [[07:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26106.86s)]
*  Indian plate down here, we have the Eurasian plate up here and two further plates. Now all that [[07:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26111.260000000002s)]
*  jostling creates a lot of friction and when that friction gets released that's when an earthquake [[07:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26116.62s)]
*  can happen. Now the early evidence here suggests to us that that energy has been released along a [[07:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26121.34s)]
*  major fault line. That's this dashed red line which is running through the centre of Myanmar. [[07:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26126.54s)]
*  Now that runs for nearly 1200 kilometres and the reason why we think this earthquake was so big [[07:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26131.74s)]
*  and fell on such a massive scale at the surface is that it was very shallow, only about 10 kilometres [[07:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26137.98s)]
*  below the surface. Now Bangkok in Thailand is more than a thousand kilometres away from that centre [[07:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26143.26s)]
*  but the reason they still experience very significant impacts is because that fault line, [[07:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26149.42s)]
*  the one that I highlighted here in red, runs very straight and that means a lot of the energy gets [[07:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26153.5s)]
*  transferred down that fault. So as we understand it at the moment this was a significant earthquake [[07:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26158.54s)]
*  and we anticipate that there'll potentially be more fatalities still to find out about. [[07:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26164.620000000003s)]
*  Esme, thanks very much indeed for that update. Well I'm joined now by Dr David Brenner who is [[07:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26169.34s)]
*  at the Department of International Relations at Sussex University and was due to be holding a [[07:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26174.86s)]
*  lecture with students in Myanmar today. David have you been in touch with colleagues in Mandalay? [[07:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26178.54s)]
*  I've been in touch with people across Myanmar, specifically also north of Mandalay and Sagaing, [[07:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26184.7s)]
*  places that are not controlled by the state and yeah so the capabilities of people to respond [[07:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26189.980000000003s)]
*  and to respond also with humanitarian aid relief is heavily prefigured by the political situation [[07:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26197.260000000002s)]
*  it seems. What have you actually heard about the the direct effects of the quake itself? I think [[07:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26203.34s)]
*  it's a bit too early to say yet. I think what is very striking of course is that we see a lot of [[07:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26208.86s)]
*  images, a lot of footage from Thailand and from the actual epicentre of the earthquake. We see [[07:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26214.699999999997s)]
*  much less so but what we do see is horrendous, it's horrific. So most likely we will have to [[07:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26219.739999999998s)]
*  wait for a few more days or even weeks to understand the full scale of this and this of course is also [[07:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26225.899999999998s)]
*  owed to the difficult information environment in an area in a country that is heavily restricted [[07:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26231.82s)]
*  for independent journalism to journalists to report from specifically by the military authorities [[07:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26237.74s)]
*  of course. And from what makeup of Myanmar now which areas are going to be most difficult for [[07:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26244.140000000003s)]
*  rescue workers, aid agencies, international teams to actually get access to? There's difficulties [[07:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26252.54s)]
*  in many areas. I mean I think what seems clear is that this earthquake has been specifically [[07:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26261.18s)]
*  devastating in the centre of Myanmar, so Mandalay and the regions around it. And there's difficulties [[07:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26265.66s)]
*  of course to get access to all of those. So Mandalay is a place that is very much built up, [[07:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26273.42s)]
*  it's an urban centre with like one and a half million people. So the scale of devastation there [[07:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26278.62s)]
*  will be significant. The junta, the military regime has asked for international aid this time [[07:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26283.5s)]
*  and this is actually surprising because we've had very heavy restrictions on international [[07:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26290.62s)]
*  relief aid in other national catastrophes in Myanmar. So Cyclone Nargis for instance, Cyclone Mokka, [[07:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26296.46s)]
*  but so it comes to show that the junta is of course itself very very stretched at the time [[07:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26303.02s)]
*  of heavy war against armed opposition forces. Let's see what will come from this. But the areas [[07:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26308.86s)]
*  that are not controlled by the junta are the areas just outside of Mandalay in the north of Mandalay [[07:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26315.34s)]
*  so it's like Gying and Magwe, southern Chan State for instance. And many of these places are [[07:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26320.62s)]
*  controlled by armed opposition forces, very different fragmented forces often. And in these [[07:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26325.5s)]
*  places where there's very heavy fighting ongoing anyway, these are the places where the military [[07:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26331.18s)]
*  is restricting most likely humanitarian aid to come in. Just briefly if I may, US aid that was [[07:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26335.98s)]
*  withdrawn of course, those cuts, are you hearing any of it's been reinstated? What's the effect [[07:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26342.94s)]
*  going to be? I haven't heard anything about it being reinstated but the effects have already [[07:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26348.06s)]
*  been disastrous. I mean we are speaking about a natural disaster in the midst of a man-made [[07:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26352.78s)]
*  disaster of a permanent emergency. So the World Food Program for instance has had to cut food aid [[07:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26359.5s)]
*  for one million people in Myanmar just last month. About a third of the population is food insecure [[07:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26365.34s)]
*  in Myanmar and so the US aid cuts of course will continue to have a devastating effect. [[07:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26371.26s)]
*  Let's see what the effect of the earthquake will be there but I mean it doesn't really seem likely [[07:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26377.66s)]
*  to me that any of this will be reversed. What is important is that donors are creative with aid [[07:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26382.54s)]
*  through community-based organizations, cross-border channels, not just through the kind of [[07:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26390.06s)]
*  state-to-state donations because the Myanmar state, it doesn't actually control about 50% [[07:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26394.86s)]
*  of the territory in Myanmar so to actually access all the areas donors need to be very [[07:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26401.74s)]
*  creative and work with a lot of different partners on the ground. Dr David Brenner, [[07:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26406.54s)]
*  Sussex University, thank you. You're welcome. [[07:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26410.460000000003s)]
*  The epicentre was in Myanmar but Thailand has also been badly affected with, you can see rescue [[07:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26419.26s)]
*  workers there at the collapse of a huge building that was under construction that literally [[07:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26436.379999999997s)]
*  collapsed with those earthquake tremors and dozens of workers are believed to be missing [[07:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26441.5s)]
*  but the rescue workers are continuing as night has fallen to try to find anyone alive that they [[07:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26448.7s)]
*  can. Well we are joined here by Rebecca Hentschke who was the BBC's Asia correspondent and knows [[07:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26454.3s)]
*  Myanmar in particular very well. Rebecca this is an absolute tragedy for the country and it's made [[07:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26463.82s)]
*  even more difficult because of the political situation but we've seen this this unusual call [[07:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26469.18s)]
*  from the military junta for international help. Yes it's unusual because when the Myanmar military [[07:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26474.62s)]
*  seized power in a coup four years ago they effectively cut the country off from the [[07:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26480.94s)]
*  international community so they've banned foreign journalists, they've made it very difficult for [[07:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26486.379999999997s)]
*  foreign aid agencies to work in Myanmar and they've also made it very difficult for [[07:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26491.82s)]
*  for local doctors, nurses, hospitals to operate and intimidated local media so for them now to [[07:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26496.7s)]
*  admit that they need this international help is a very significant moment but at the same time [[07:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26504.38s)]
*  where I've been speaking with a number of aid agencies this morning and and they're saying [[07:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26509.82s)]
*  that's a promise but what they want to see is that level of access because they're worried about [[07:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26515.66s)]
*  their teams being intimidated by the military and not getting that level of access that they need [[07:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26520.7s)]
*  right now to deal with what is clearly a very bad situation. And from what we know of the country [[07:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26527.74s)]
*  which obviously has been under sanctions, the economy's been struggling, how equipped do you [[07:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26535.02s)]
*  think the junta will be to get to these difficult areas? We've seen you know one bridge collapse but [[07:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26540.3s)]
*  it's speed which is always so important in an earthquake disaster. Even before this earthquake [[07:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26545.1s)]
*  the United Nations was warning that a third of the country would need aid this year. You know [[07:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26551.26s)]
*  millions of people have been displaced by this civil war and many of the people that have fled [[07:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26557.42s)]
*  the country are doctors and nurses. People might remember in the days after the coup [[07:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26563.26s)]
*  a lot of that civil disobedience movement, people refusing to work, wanting a return to democracy, [[07:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26568.379999999997s)]
*  that was led by doctors and nurses so the military has also targeted them forcing many of them to [[07:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26574.059999999998s)]
*  flee. So hospitals, healthcare centres were already crippled before this earthquake so the images that [[07:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26580.78s)]
*  were getting out of Myanmar and they are limited are people on beds out in the open and also [[07:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26587.899999999998s)]
*  hospitals have also crumbled in this earthquake. Mandalay we're hearing that as well. So a very dire [[07:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26594.219999999998s)]
*  situation not a situation that the military can control. And what about the fact that some areas [[07:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26600.78s)]
*  obviously have got big opposition numbers, the opposition is fractured, there's multiple groups [[07:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26607.66s)]
*  aren't there. Will the military go into those areas? Will there be cooperation? Will international aid [[07:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26612.06s)]
*  agencies been allowed into those areas? That's right I mean here on Verify we did a data project [[07:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26618.38s)]
*  not that long ago looking at who controls Myanmar and we found that the military has only total [[07:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26623.18s)]
*  control of less than a quarter of the country and particularly this epicentre area Sagai. When we [[07:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26629.579999999998s)]
*  looked at that it is literally a patchwork of control so different groups pro-democracy groups [[07:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26635.42s)]
*  are called the People's Defence Forces also of course the cities controlled by the military [[07:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26641.179999999997s)]
*  so that also makes a very complex picture. The People's Defence Forces, the National Unity [[07:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26646.059999999998s)]
*  Government have come out in the last few hours and said that they're also carrying out rescue [[07:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26650.859999999997s)]
*  operations trying to get aid to people, the military is doing the same but we're hearing from [[07:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26655.899999999998s)]
*  people on the ground, my colleagues in BBC Burmese just got through to some people in Mandalay, [[07:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26660.86s)]
*  they're not seeing any aid or recovery effort coming they're saying we've seen lots of buildings [[07:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26665.58s)]
*  crumbled, people are trapped inside and no one is coming to help them. And Rebecca we saw the US [[07:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26671.58s)]
*  Geological Survey saying that given the sort of huge depth of this earthquake, the size of it, [[07:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26677.74s)]
*  it was actually shallow but it was very strong that obviously potentially the numbers affected [[07:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26685.98s)]
*  and killed could be very very high, we don't know that yet but what are you hearing about [[07:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26690.22s)]
*  the potential impact? Yes the figures that we've received from the military government seem low [[07:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26694.14s)]
*  looking at the devastation, the images that we're getting through and from some of these people that [[07:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26699.74s)]
*  we've been able to reach in Mandalay. They said the city is a tragic scene, someone used that word, [[07:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26705.100000000002s)]
*  that there's rubble everywhere, that there isn't a recovery effort going on, if you look in stark [[07:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26712.300000000003s)]
*  contrast to the images we're getting from Thailand it's a very different picture so it seems very [[07:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26718.86s)]
*  likely that this death toll will rise. And do we know if other countries come in, obviously China [[07:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26725.100000000002s)]
*  has been you know supportive of to a degree of this military junta, will they be sending help, [[07:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26732.3s)]
*  India's offered help and the junta said they'll accept it and from ASEAN, how quickly can those [[07:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26739.66s)]
*  teams get in and how free do you think those countries will be allowed to be? Well the United [[07:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26744.14s)]
*  Nations has also said it's preparing efforts now to get in, I think we'll have to see, I mean the [[07:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26750.3s)]
*  Myanmar military is saying they want aid but what as we've seen it's a vacuum, they've been cut off [[07:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26757.1s)]
*  from the world now for four years, I mean China's got some relationship with the military but again [[07:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26763.739999999998s)]
*  it's very limited and huge areas of those border regions are now controlled by ethnic rebels so [[07:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26769.18s)]
*  it's a complex picture for aid agencies to get into but the next 24 hours will really be key, [[07:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26774.54s)]
*  all the aid agencies are saying we need to get in now if we're going to save lives. And are there [[07:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26781.260000000002s)]
*  any other nations which have got influence and who the junta might trust to go in and help? You've [[07:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26786.54s)]
*  mentioned the key too, that's China and India, that they have some influence, ASEAN has tried [[07:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26790.94s)]
*  to have influence but that relationship since the junta took power has been strained, Thailand of [[07:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26796.94s)]
*  course will be key, so I think aid agencies are saying they're ready, these neighbouring countries [[07:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26802.78s)]
*  are saying that they're ready, will come in and help but it's a very complex picture that they're [[07:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26807.739999999998s)]
*  coming into, this is a civil war and Sagaing has been a key battleground in this civil war [[07:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26812.699999999997s)]
*  so the military just recently has been carrying air strikes out so bombing key infrastructure, [[07:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26818.3s)]
*  bridges and roads and then you've also got this patchwork of civilian resistance groups so [[07:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26823.5s)]
*  one of the aid workers as I was talking to is saying you face intimidation from different [[07:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26829.66s)]
*  groups and you need to negotiate that to get aid to people. And can the UN be trusted do you think, [[07:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26835.1s)]
*  I mean if the UN is going to go in, we saw the UN this week actually say that they were going to [[07:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26842.78s)]
*  cut the level of food aid to about a million people there but will the junta, you know at this stage [[07:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26847.26s)]
*  if they're facing a really big crisis think they have got to turn externally and trust people [[07:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26852.7s)]
*  because what are they you know practically afraid of if other countries go in? Well they, the Myanmar [[07:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26857.82s)]
*  military is losing this war, they are losing control of the country so they are afraid of outside [[07:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26863.82s)]
*  influence on that resistance and also people knowing what's going on. The Myanmar military [[07:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26872.38s)]
*  has been accused by the United Nations of carrying out war crimes in the country so [[07:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26877.26s)]
*  they don't want that kind of scrutiny but this could be a key turning point. I mean remember [[07:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26883.26s)]
*  after the Aceh tsunami that led to a peace deal between rebels and the Indonesian government who [[07:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26888.3s)]
*  were fighting so perhaps with an optimistic viewpoint this could be a moment where the junta [[07:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26893.34s)]
*  just has to open up to the world and on Myanmar. I know you and I have talked about this being a [[07:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26900.219999999998s)]
*  forgotten conflict, a forgotten situation. Now this earthquake has forced the eyes of the world [[07:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26904.94s)]
*  to look at what's happening in Myanmar and hopefully that will lead to help on the humanitarian level [[07:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26910.46s)]
*  but also to end this civil war. And we of course have taught Rebecca for years about you know the [[07:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26916.3s)]
*  resistance and the fight of Aung San Suu Kyi, the huge momentum that she had and the support within [[07:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26922.219999999998s)]
*  the population but can you just explain for me where now those resistance groups are because [[07:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26927.98s)]
*  you're saying that there are many out there. There are but they are all united with one [[07:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26933.74s)]
*  common goal and that is to overthrow the military government. They're very united on that front but [[07:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26938.780000000002s)]
*  the groups are made up of the People's Defence Forces so these are local communities made up of [[07:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26944.54s)]
*  models, actors, students, people who never believed that they would turn into militia fighters [[07:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26951.260000000002s)]
*  effectively. These were students who protested for democracy so you've got those groups particularly [[07:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26957.260000000002s)]
*  in Sagai where this earthquake epicentre is that's the groups that are fighting, [[07:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26962.54s)]
*  farmers, teachers and then on the border regions you've got more established ethnic armies who [[07:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26966.86s)]
*  have been fighting for decades for greater autonomy. They're united and they now control [[07:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26972.3s)]
*  huge areas of Myanmar and they're looking for a moment where they can see a federal democracy. [[07:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26978.06s)]
*  I'm joined now by Chris Weeks who headed up the airport disaster logistics teams for DHL [[07:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26986.54s)]
*  for 20 years. These are the teams first on the ground and they coordinate the military relief [[07:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26991.26s)]
*  and the rescue workers coming in. Chris was in Myanmar in 2006 when the cyclone hit the country. [[07:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=26995.579999999998s)]
*  Thanks for being with us Chris. From what you know of the country how difficult is it going to be [[07:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27001.98s)]
*  for the military junta to get where they need to at speed? Oh it's going to be a big challenge for [[07:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27009.1s)]
*  everybody to be honest with you. I hope things have changed since I was in Myanmar after the [[07:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27017.100000000002s)]
*  cyclone because it was definitely the most challenging place I've ever worked. Access to [[07:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27023.58s)]
*  the authorities in an efficient way is extremely difficult. They don't make life easy for you. [[07:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27031.02s)]
*  The communications around the country is compromised. It's difficult to get transport. [[07:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27039.98s)]
*  It's difficult to get effective people to come and work for you. It's all sorts of hazards. [[07:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27047.34s)]
*  Yes I mean we did hear that the power was affected. Maybe some of it has been reconnected [[07:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27054.78s)]
*  but in these very first few critical hours can you explain for us what different groups will [[07:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27061.66s)]
*  be doing? How exactly will people be trying to move in and help? Well the rescue phase comes [[07:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27068.06s)]
*  first. That's where we are now. So getting international search and rescue teams in country [[07:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27074.38s)]
*  is going to be the first job. It's likely that regional teams from Japan, China, Singapore [[07:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27081.5s)]
*  will be getting there first and those are the ones that are most likely to save lives to be [[07:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27089.66s)]
*  honest with you. And we've heard ASEAN and India also being welcomed by the military junta but [[07:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27095.5s)]
*  they have to get in within hours don't they because we know that for survivors that's the most [[07:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27104.22s)]
*  critical thing and if the roads and bridges are affected how do those teams move around? [[07:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27108.94s)]
*  Well this is going to be extremely difficult. They'll most likely head for Yangon because it's [[07:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27115.58s)]
*  got the biggest airport there and the most resources and I heard Mandalay airport's been [[07:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27121.66s)]
*  closed as well. So they'll most likely head for Yangon and sort of muster there and try and find [[07:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27127.18s)]
*  ways of getting from there up to up to Mandalay either by road or by onward aircraft transfers. [[07:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27134.3s)]
*  We know of course that one of Donald Trump's first actions when he came to office was to cut [[07:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27145.579999999998s)]
*  US aid. Will that have an impact on the help that is given here? Well US aid was traditionally a [[07:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27150.3s)]
*  major player in the disaster relief theatre and they would always they would task the US military [[07:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27158.86s)]
*  to to help them and they were the the major player to be honest. [[07:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27167.34s)]
*  What was the impact on the US aid? [[07:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27180.78s)]
*  They had all the assets so you know now it remains to be seen whether they will come and help. [[07:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27185.02s)]
*  They would usually put in an offshore and fly in with helicopters. They carry relief goods on board [[07:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27191.42s)]
*  the fleet so those would be traditionally that the first one of the first people that you would [[07:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27200.94s)]
*  expect in after a disaster such as this. And if they are not doing that role now [[07:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27207.58s)]
*  are any other countries able to to take that role instead? [[07:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27214.54s)]
*  Well I suspect that China will know a well-equipped. Singapore I mentioned. India as well. [[07:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27218.54s)]
*  They're the the regional players that will come in. Australia, New Zealand, [[07:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27224.3s)]
*  still quite a long way away and although they they will probably be in the second wave. [[07:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27228.22s)]
*  If you know if petrol is rationed if there's no internet so communications is difficult [[07:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27234.140000000003s)]
*  how do how do the teams on the ground from all these different agencies and groups how do they [[07:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27242.620000000003s)]
*  coordinate where to go and what to do? Well there's a United Nations agency [[07:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27247.260000000002s)]
*  OCHA is responsible for for coordinating the the rescue effort. The United Nations has a compound in [[07:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27252.7s)]
*  in Yangon or at least it did which will be the coordinating body. They're well trained and set up [[07:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27260.7s)]
*  for for this activity and I trust that they'll be there and with World Food Program as well. [[07:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27268.54s)]
*  Another major player with the logistics cluster who will be on site pretty quickly I would think [[07:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27275.100000000002s)]
*  to coordinate everybody in their efforts. You say if you say if petrol and [[07:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27282.7s)]
*  communications are rationed well petrol is severely limited in in the country as far as I know where [[07:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27289.98s)]
*  they use the lack of petrol to stop people moving around and I think it'll find I think the the the [[07:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27299.02s)]
*  NGOs will find it extremely difficult to just hire a truck and get it to take you up to [[07:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27305.820000000003s)]
*  up country. It's not like that in Myanmar. You buy your petrol on the side of the road [[07:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27313.980000000003s)]
*  most likely and people are not allowed to necessarily travel from region to region [[07:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27321.34s)]
*  and mobile phones aren't as prolific as we expect them. Payment systems [[07:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27329.26s)]
*  are not working there. You need to have dollars paying cash nice clean dollars to be able to [[07:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27336.62s)]
*  operate in the country and it's going to be pretty tricky. You said that also obviously [[07:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27345.579999999998s)]
*  the authorities when you were there obviously that you know didn't make life easy as you're explaining. [[07:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27351.739999999998s)]
*  Given the junta the military junta have appealed for international help they're saying from any [[07:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27356.940000000002s)]
*  group and any government for donations and for help do you think there is a hope that they will [[07:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27361.260000000002s)]
*  facilitate you know countries and groups now? Well it's certainly unusual and and yes one should be [[07:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27367.420000000002s)]
*  hopeful however what what tends to happen in these situations is that the the leaders at the top make [[07:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27376.54s)]
*  a statement like this but they don't necessarily let the command flow down the line so your customs [[07:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27384.38s)]
*  officer won't necessarily understand that he's allowed to let aid come through the airport [[07:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27391.9s)]
*  to help everybody. He may not have had those instructions and it can be extremely difficult [[07:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27400.3s)]
*  to operate under a military regime such as this. And just you know getting in all the sort of heavy [[07:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27407.260000000002s)]
*  equipment and the sniffer dogs how long do you think it'll be before we see these other [[07:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27414.14s)]
*  countries being able to get teams on the ground? I would hope to see some teams in there within a [[07:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27420.22s)]
*  day or so otherwise there's not much not really much point in them going. They have a sort of [[07:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27426.38s)]
*  72 hour window to be able to make some significant life-saving activity so let's hope over the [[07:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27432.22s)]
*  weekend they can get in but there'll be those regional teams I mentioned who will be able to [[07:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27442.7s)]
*  get there first and actually do the good work. To Bangkok and speak to our news reporter Lindell [[07:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27447.9s)]
*  Markwell and Lindell just explain where you are because you're just well in front of the building [[07:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27455.5s)]
*  I think that we saw images of earlier. Yeah I'm in Chattachat which is in the the northwest of [[07:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27461.74s)]
*  the city which is where this building came down earlier today. This was a construction site 400 [[07:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27469.980000000003s)]
*  people came to work here here this morning and more than 50 are still missing. When the earthquake [[07:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27477.100000000002s)]
*  struck the building is thought to have come down within the first few minutes. This is the only [[07:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27484.940000000002s)]
*  building we know that has come down in Bangkok but there are many people still missing here today [[07:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27490.54s)]
*  and the rescue waiting for quite a long time for diggers to come but you can see there that there [[07:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27495.98s)]
*  are some diggers on site now and very slowly they've been starting to work through the rubble. [[07:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27501.82s)]
*  Sadly we've now started to hear that some of the figures in terms of those who've died [[07:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27506.7s)]
*  we understand seven people here lost their lives and one also lost their life at another [[07:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27512.46s)]
*  construction site nearby. The Thai Prime Minister was here a few hours ago to see the work of the [[07:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27517.66s)]
*  rescue workers to talk about plans moving forward. She also tried to reassure Bangkok really to say [[07:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27525.1s)]
*  that the rest of the city's buildings are thought to be safe. They believe that the other buildings [[07:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27532.86s)]
*  in the city were able to withstand this level of earthquake and people have gone back to their homes [[07:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27539.82s)]
*  this evening but here tonight the rescue work is really just beginning. [[07:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27545.34s)]
*  Does the city have the resources that it needs to do that work because obviously speed is incredibly important? [[07:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27550.62s)]
*  Absolutely. We've seen hundreds of rescue vehicles coming in here over the last few hours. [[07:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27560.7s)]
*  Firefighters, police, they've set up a field hospital. They appear to be really getting [[07:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27567.420000000002s)]
*  everything in place to help here but around the rest of the city although we didn't see other [[07:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27573.34s)]
*  collapsed buildings we have seen cracks appearing in lots of buildings, glass smashing and things [[07:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27578.3s)]
*  like that and although you know people have mostly returned to their homes many people will be quite [[07:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27583.18s)]
*  concerned. So the city have announced this evening that they have 2,000 or so engineers who've [[07:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27587.420000000002s)]
*  volunteered to help. There's going to be a hotline set up so if people see cracks are concerned about [[07:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27593.1s)]
*  the safety in their building they can now phone that in and the hope is that those things will [[07:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27597.18s)]
*  be addressed but you know it's a big city and the real sort of level of damage still needs to be [[07:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27601.58s)]
*  assessed. And just briefly I mean a lot of people must be worried about whether their buildings are [[07:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27606.54s)]
*  safe because Bangkok buildings wouldn't necessarily be built with earthquakes in mind in terms of their [[07:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27611.74s)]
*  engineering structures. Absolutely. I mean this isn't in an earthquake zone and I've lived here [[07:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27616.620000000003s)]
*  over two years and haven't felt any tremors here before but there are regulations and in more recent [[07:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27625.66s)]
*  years those regulations have increased so I think the newer buildings are thought to be safer but [[07:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27631.66s)]
*  you know there will be buildings, there are lots of old buildings here who might not [[07:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27638.06s)]
*  have the same earthquake standards when they were built. So there are concerns and there's been a [[07:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27642.3s)]
*  lot of confusion today but I think there's also probably relief that more buildings haven't collapsed here. [[07:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27649.66s)]
*  Hello I'm Geetha Goramuthy thanks for being with us. The military junta in Myanmar says according to their latest information [[07:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27745.9s)]
*  144 people have been killed with 732 injured in the earthquake that has hit the country. Of those [[07:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27762.38s)]
*  who died they say 96 people were in Naipidore, 18 in Saigon and 30 in Mandalay but the numbers of [[07:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27769.66s)]
*  those affected are expected to rise overall. While the military junta chief is inviting help from any [[07:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27776.94s)]
*  country in any organization saying they've opened up routes for international assistance. They've [[07:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27783.34s)]
*  permitted India and ASEAN to help. A state of emergency is in place right across the huge swathe [[07:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27787.98s)]
*  of southeast Asia affected after this earthquake shook Myanmar, Thailand and parts of southwest [[07:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27793.9s)]
*  China. Well the main quake came during the early afternoon local time and it was recorded at 7.7 [[07:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27799.34s)]
*  magnitude and just six miles deep. The epicenter was close to Myanmar's second city of Mandalay. [[07:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27805.5s)]
*  Powerful tremors were felt 600 miles away in the Thai capital Bangkok. Authorities there have [[07:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27812.06s)]
*  declared the city a disaster area with 10 people confirmed dead. This building which was under [[07:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27816.940000000002s)]
*  construction collapsed and searches are ongoing for dozens of workers who were in the building [[07:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27822.7s)]
*  at the time. Well Marie Manrique is from the Red Crescent and is based in Yangon in Myanmar. Here's [[07:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27827.98s)]
*  her assessment of the situation there and the scale of the operation needed to help people affected [[07:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27834.940000000002s)]
*  most. I can tell you for the Red Cross movement in country we consider this a serious humanitarian [[07:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27840.46s)]
*  issue as you have just mentioned. We're talking about a 7.7 magnitude earthquake with aftershocks [[07:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27848.62s)]
*  including one 12 minutes later that was 6.4 in the same area and ongoing aftershocks including [[07:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27856.14s)]
*  several hours later. We know that for the Red Cross the Red Cross immediately started responding. The [[07:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27862.46s)]
*  Myanmar Red Cross Society has volunteers throughout the country and so those volunteers have been [[07:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27869.34s)]
*  engaged in search and rescue assessments as well as to seeing how to support other needs that are [[07:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27875.02s)]
*  emerging. At this time they're still engaged in what would be considered very rapid assessments [[07:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27880.86s)]
*  on the ground. And are you able to give us an idea of what the casualty figures might be? [[07:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27886.7s)]
*  Unfortunately at this time we're unable to know the casualty figures. I think that this is something [[07:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27896.46s)]
*  that we're still waiting for information from the field. We know that there are humanitarian [[07:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27902.22s)]
*  actors including the Red Cross that have immediately responded. This is something it is now night time [[07:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27907.5s)]
*  here. We're talking 9.30 at night. It's quite dark out. We know that these local humanitarian [[07:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27913.02s)]
*  actors are still looking for people in buildings that have collapsed. We also know that infrastructure [[07:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27917.66s)]
*  was largely affected including roads and bridges, public institutions as well. So this is something [[07:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27925.58s)]
*  we understand as a very serious humanitarian crisis and disaster that will need a large scale [[07:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27932.86s)]
*  response. And we've had some initial figures from the military junta but obviously there's going to [[07:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27938.940000000002s)]
*  be fears that those numbers will get much worse. Can you give us a sense of how difficult it is [[07:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27945.18s)]
*  for agencies such as yours and the authorities to get to the people who need help? [[07:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27952.940000000002s)]
*  Well thank you for asking. So the country of Myanmar is actually prone to many natural disasters. It [[07:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27960.38s)]
*  has hazards. Recently as of last year large scale flooding in the country. We're currently in the [[07:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27966.7s)]
*  very hot season in Myanmar so that includes heat waves that can reach up to 44 degrees in some [[07:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27973.5s)]
*  locations. The areas of the country that are most affected include the second largest city in the [[07:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27979.82s)]
*  country and I am in Yangon which is the largest city further south was also affected and we felt [[07:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27985.98s)]
*  the earthquake when it occurred at midday. And can you tell us how bad it was where you were? [[07:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27994.22s)]
*  What did you actually feel? So immediately as in earthquakes people generally doubt what they're [[07:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=27999.579999999998s)]
*  feeling and then the response for us as the Red Cross is always with our emergency response [[07:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28006.94s)]
*  procedures to evacuate the building. We're located within the Myanmar Red Cross Society [[07:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28012.14s)]
*  building here in Yangon. All of us evacuated into the street. Fortunately there were no [[07:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28016.62s)]
*  actually no damage to the building or to any people within the building but we do understand [[07:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28022.859999999997s)]
*  that this is something that we're trying to gain information on what has actually happened to some [[07:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28028.539999999997s)]
*  of the Red Cross buildings outside of Yangon. The headquarters in Nebido was slightly damaged. We [[07:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28034.06s)]
*  know that in Mandalay the emergency operations centre of the Myanmar Red Cross Society was also [[07:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28040.38s)]
*  damaged so we're looking at some of the local humanitarian responders are also themselves [[07:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28046.86s)]
*  affected by this earthquake. And can you just give us a sense of how strong [[07:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28052.54s)]
*  that earthquake felt? I don't know if you've experienced that before but what was it like [[07:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28056.940000000002s)]
*  to actually be in the moment? Yeah let's just say it was a very strong feeling here in Yangon [[07:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28062.94s)]
*  and our solidarity for the people actually of Myanmar that had been affected in the northwest [[07:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28069.579999999998s)]
*  of the country. If I myself felt it so much I can't imagine the situation the very serious [[07:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28074.539999999997s)]
*  situation that was felt in those areas close to the epicenter. When I say that I felt it [[07:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28081.42s)]
*  it was several minutes of feeling it. We were still having evacuation from the building here [[07:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28087.98s)]
*  in Yangon and still feeling it and as I mentioned you know part of the evacuation procedures is to [[07:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28093.579999999998s)]
*  stay outside the building for some time. We could see in Yangon that other people were also concerned [[07:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28100.3s)]
*  about the earthquake and how long that the aftershock was then felt 12 minutes later. [[07:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28104.78s)]
*  And the authorities there have appealed for outside help. They're saying they're opening up [[07:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28111.26s)]
*  routes for people to donate and to get there. They say they're going to accept help from India [[07:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28116.7s)]
*  and from ASEAN. I mean the urgency of this I'm sure is incredibly stark to get to those people [[07:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28122.06s)]
*  who might be trapped. Yes it's incredibly important. We have a small window of opportunity [[07:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28129.34s)]
*  and I think that all of us as humanitarians as well as other institutions in the country are [[07:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28136.06s)]
*  trying very hard and probably will try until the very last possibility to reach those people that [[07:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28142.38s)]
*  are as I mentioned in collapsed buildings or in buildings that they're unable to get out of. [[07:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28148.86s)]
*  We also appreciate that there is that request for international aid. This is something that we in the [[07:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28154.7s)]
*  Red Cross and Red Crescent movement are working together. So this includes the [[07:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28161.9s)]
*  International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross, [[07:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28166.7s)]
*  of course directly in support of the BMI Red Cross Society in country. Can I just ask you as well [[07:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28170.3s)]
*  very briefly we've had one report which we haven't been able to check ourselves yet but [[07:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28177.26s)]
*  that the US Geological Survey might have indicated that the death toll could be really [[07:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28183.26s)]
*  very high. That they're talking you know potentially in the thousands. Do you have any information as [[07:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28187.5s)]
*  to just how widespread the damage and the effects here might be? [[07:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28193.34s)]
*  So currently we're focused on the emergency response as you can imagine. So the numbers [[07:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28199.58s)]
*  themselves we don't have at this moment. Moving forward that's one of the topics that we need to [[07:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28203.58s)]
*  respond to looking at what the humanitarian needs are of the people that have been affected. We're [[07:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28209.34s)]
*  really focused right now on trying to get to the people in need and to respond to the people that [[07:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28214.94s)]
*  have lost their homes and have been deeply affected by this unfortunate disaster. [[07:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28220.14s)]
*  Marie Manrique there from the Red Crescent who is in Yangon speaking to me a little earlier. Well [[07:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28226.14s)]
*  Tim Wright is an earth scientist and professor from the University of Leeds School of Earth [[07:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28231.42s)]
*  and Environment. He's also co-director of the Centre for Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, [[07:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28235.66s)]
*  Volcanoes and Tectonics. He explained to me more about this kind of earthquake and what we know so [[07:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28239.739999999998s)]
*  far. This earthquake has struck this region near the town of Mandalay in Myanmar and it seems to, [[07:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28244.62s)]
*  so one thing to bear in mind for earthquakes of this size, all earthquakes really they're not [[07:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28254.3s)]
*  point sources so they're not just like an explosion that just happens in one location. [[07:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28259.34s)]
*  Earthquakes are caused by flip on tectonic faults and to have a big earthquake you need [[07:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28264.7s)]
*  a lot of slip on a long fault and the evidence we're getting from seismic waves from this event [[07:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28271.74s)]
*  is that the earthquake fault was about 200 kilometres long so it goes to about 50 kilometres [[07:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28278.86s)]
*  to the north of Mandalay and about 150 kilometres to the south and we'd expect really intense [[07:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28284.22s)]
*  shaking and damage unfortunately along that entire zone. Just to put that in perspective that's like [[07:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28290.94s)]
*  you're getting most of the way along the M1 from London to Sheffield something like that. It's a [[07:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28297.98s)]
*  very large region that's going to have been impacted by this devastating event. [[07:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28302.3s)]
*  Do we know what causes these movements? Yeah I mean if we take a step back ultimately they're [[07:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28307.42s)]
*  caused by the motions of tectonic plates in this particular region to the west we've got the [[07:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28313.26s)]
*  Indian plate that's kind of ploughing north colliding with Eurasia and that's creating the [[07:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28319.42s)]
*  Himalayas creating the Tibetan plateau and Myanmar's essentially caught along the edge of [[07:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28325.1s)]
*  that and it's being kind of sheared so the west of Myanmar is being pushed up to the north and a [[07:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28331.42s)]
*  lot of that motion is about two centimeters every year on average something like the speed your [[07:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28338.14s)]
*  fingernails grow and a lot of that motion is taken up on this north-south fault called the Sagang fault [[07:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28344.379999999997s)]
*  which appears to be the fault that slipped in this earthquake. [[07:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28350.54s)]
*  Would you expect further aftershocks or will most of those have happened by now? [[07:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28353.98s)]
*  We'd expect a series of aftershocks now that will take place over many days months and indeed years [[07:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28359.18s)]
*  following this event. Those can be they're typically smaller than the first event but [[07:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28365.98s)]
*  you can't rule out another large triggered earthquake as well so many of your viewers will [[07:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28372.22s)]
*  remember the the earthquakes that we had in in Turkey in two years ago there was a one earthquake [[07:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28379.82s)]
*  was very similar so this one ruptured 300 kilometers of a fault and then there was another [[07:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28387.18s)]
*  earthquake very large earthquake also happened within about 10 hours that's extremely rare but [[07:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28391.18s)]
*  it's we can't rule that out as well but there will definitely be ongoing smaller earthquakes [[07:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28398.62s)]
*  that will continue for many many months unfortunately. And the epicenter as we knew was in Myanmar we are [[07:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28403.82s)]
*  trying to get voices from there but it's not easy when you look at the the measurements that we've got [[07:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28409.5s)]
*  what would be the impact for those who were perhaps you know most at risk of being at the [[07:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28415.1s)]
*  center of this? Yeah I think it would would have felt extremely violent shaking if you're [[07:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28419.34s)]
*  anywhere near that 200 kilometer long fault and so that's likely to have caused significant [[07:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28425.1s)]
*  damage it does obviously the impact of that depends very much on the type of building [[07:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28431.26s)]
*  that you've got what people are living in the one of the kind of tragic things that we can do quite [[07:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28437.66s)]
*  quickly now these days is estimate make estimates of the number of people who might have been killed [[07:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28445.260000000002s)]
*  by an earthquake and we get those first estimates within about 20 to 30 minutes and the US Geological [[07:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28451.9s)]
*  Survey is one organization that does that and they're estimating at the moment that there's a [[07:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28458.14s)]
*  more than 50 percent chance of there being more than 10 000 people killed by this event. I'm [[07:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28463.82s)]
*  hopeful this will be smaller than that and the earthquake was at midday and so it very much [[07:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28469.579999999998s)]
*  depends where people are what they were doing. We know that the Turkey earthquakes one of the [[07:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28475.579999999998s)]
*  reasons they killed so many people two years ago was that it was in the middle of the night so many [[07:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28481.98s)]
*  people were in their homes when those buildings collapsed and midday is a is a better time of day [[07:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28486.86s)]
*  in terms of casualties for an earthquake. We're just seeing pictures that we've had in from [[07:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28493.260000000002s)]
*  Mandalay which is obviously near where this earthquake struck and we can see some of the [[07:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28498.54s)]
*  damage there to the buildings. Would you expect if tectonic plates shift in one part of the world [[07:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28504.94s)]
*  like this does it have an impact on other plates I mean are other areas which are earthquake prone [[07:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28512.78s)]
*  also then at risk of some activity or does this tend to be confined to this one geological area? [[07:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28520.14s)]
*  We think there aren't very long range interactions so we think that when you have an earthquake on a [[07:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28527.66s)]
*  fault like this it will affect the immediate region so you know within a few hundred kilometers [[07:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28534.46s)]
*  of this fault will feel changes most strongly but ultimately I think you can think about these [[07:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28540.94s)]
*  plates kind of slowly moving just continually moving and then they're just kind of stuck around [[07:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28547.42s)]
*  the edges so those edges get stuck they build up stresses and then they fail periodically in [[07:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28552.14s)]
*  earthquakes and the failure on one boundary of a plate doesn't necessarily impact the [[07:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28559.899999999998s)]
*  the earthquakes on another boundary we don't think. Professor Tim Wright let me just show you [[07:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28567.019999999997s)]
*  a video. [[07:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28637.42s)]
*  you [[07:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjEcqM8JdLw&t=28661.339999999997s)]
