# Magnitude 7.7 earthquake hits Myanmar with damage reported in Bangkok | BBC News
**BBC - Breaking News:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4)
*  A reminder of our breaking news this hour, there have been two large earthquakes in central Myanmar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=0.0s)]
*  The first recorded at 0620 GMT with a magnitude of 7.7. Ten minutes later an aftershock with a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=5.2s)]
*  magnitude of 6.4 was recorded. Both were near Mandalay. Tremors have also been reported more [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=12.56s)]
*  than a thousand miles away in Thailand and China. These are the latest pictures coming into us from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=18.56s)]
*  Myanmar. We can see damage there to a main road, quite substantial damage. We haven't yet got reports [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=23.6s)]
*  of any casualties. I'm going to bring in Nicky Schiller who's with me here. So Nicky, we're [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=28.96s)]
*  seeing those pictures, they're kind of roads broken up, but so far we haven't got much of an [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=34.88s)]
*  indication of the impact of this. No, absolutely. We know that this tremor, the epicentre, was in a [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=38.96s)]
*  city in Burma called Sergayan in Mandalay, in Myanmar, the Burmese city there. It is about 100 [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=46.56s)]
*  kilometres north of the capital, Napier, Door. And as you said, this was a 7.7 magnitude earthquake [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=53.76s)]
*  and it struck at 12.50 local time, so in the afternoon, about 6.50 GMT. And it was a shallow [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  earthquake, so it was about 10 kilometres, is what they describe as shallow. And these tremors were [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=72.0s)]
*  felt across the region in China and Thailand. We've seen footage on social media in Bangkok [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=78.64s)]
*  of people gathering in the streets and I'm just seeing the AFP news agency is reporting that at [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=86.08s)]
*  least 43 workers are trapped in a Bangkok skyscraper collapse. That coming in on both the AFP and the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Reuters news agency at the moment. We have seen pictures from Bangkok of buildings shaking. There's [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=101.36s)]
*  one particular video that shows a big skyscraper that has a swimming pool on the top and the water [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=107.12s)]
*  is pouring over the side like a waterfall because of the tremors that have come from there. So, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=115.28s)]
*  Bangkok, people have been gathering in the streets. We can see that there are live pictures and of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=121.2s)]
*  course, a lot of the buildings in Bangkok are these high-rise buildings. So, this would have been [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=126.4s)]
*  around lunchtime, so people have come out onto the streets, which is the pictures that we're seeing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=131.68s)]
*  and as you mentioned just there, this latest line coming in to us from Reuters that at least 43 workers [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=136.24s)]
*  are trapped in a Bangkok skyscraper which has collapsed. So, it's always the way with earthquakes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=141.6s)]
*  is you get an initial report of the scale of it but also then you start getting in the impact [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=147.6s)]
*  where the buildings have collapsed and people are trapped. So, at the moment, 43 workers trapped in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=153.28s)]
*  a building which has collapsed in Bangkok. That's according to medics in the city and of course, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=157.6s)]
*  Bangkok hugely built up lots and lots of skyscrapers. Of course, and this area, people are [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=164.0s)]
*  used to the threat of having an earthquake. So, they will be drilled into getting out of the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=169.52s)]
*  building and onto the roads, which is why we see all of those people who are now outside because [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=175.6s)]
*  they understand they need to get out of the buildings. But as you were saying, there are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=180.4s)]
*  these reports of 43 workers trapped in one of those skyscrapers that has collapsed. In Myanmar [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=185.04s)]
*  itself, we've seen pictures near Mandalay, which is near where the epicentre was of a large bridge [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=191.52s)]
*  that has collapsed into the Irrawaddy river. And of course, social media will be a lot better [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=198.8s)]
*  in around Bangkok. So, that's why we're getting a lot of the pictures out of that area. But of course, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=205.84s)]
*  it's a lot harder to get the information out of Myanmar. So, it will take a while for us to get [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=212.08s)]
*  some of the more pictures from the actual epicentre. And of course, as we were saying, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=217.44s)]
*  this is 100 kilometres north of the capital, Napier door. So, it's not like it is in the built-up [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=221.76s)]
*  area of the capital, but near the city of Mandalay, which some people may know the name of. As I was [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=227.2s)]
*  saying, 7.7, the US Geological Survey saying this is a big, a large earthquake on the scales of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  and also the fact that it was shallow, just 10 kilometres deep, that will also impact the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=241.84s)]
*  amount of damage that we'll see. But as we can see, the people in Bangkok are out on the streets. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=247.84s)]
*  As I said, they are used to this, the residents of the Thai capital. But we've seen the pictures of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=255.12s)]
*  those, the water splashing from the swimming pools, the government also holding an emergency [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=261.44s)]
*  meeting to decide what to do at the moment. Just one other line that's come to us. I mean, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=266.96s)]
*  we're not clear whether it's the same building they're talking about, but AFP, the French [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=271.35999999999996s)]
*  news agency is reporting that it was a building which was being built of 30 stories that has [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=275.76s)]
*  fallen, that has collapsed in Bangkok. So, it is not clear at the moment whether we're talking about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=282.64s)]
*  two separate buildings, whether there's the one where the 43 workers are trapped or whether this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=287.2s)]
*  is a separate building. It's likely probably to be the same building, I would imagine, if they're [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=292.24s)]
*  described as workers. It's likely they're construction workers. Absolutely. Of course, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=296.64s)]
*  the buildings, once they're built, will have an earthquake protection in a lot of these areas. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=300.56s)]
*  They will be designed to withstand an earthquake. But if a building is being built, then it may not [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=304.88s)]
*  have that. And of course, the structures around it wouldn't be as strong to be able to withstand the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=310.64s)]
*  earthquake. Our team in Bangkok, there is of course a BBC base in Bangkok. They are reporting, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=317.28s)]
*  feeling those buildings swaying and they are people into the streets. And we will get our team, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=323.6s)]
*  as we said, we have a team in Bangkok, they're getting out. They say the shaking was dizzying, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=332.64000000000004s)]
*  which would give you a sense of just how strong the tremors were felt in Bangkok. And as we said, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=337.6s)]
*  we have seen the pictures of this water and it's a real visual sign of just how strong the tremors [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=343.76000000000005s)]
*  were. A swimming pool on top of one of these skyscrapers and the water is now coming over the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=349.52s)]
*  side of that skyscraper down as if it was like a waterfall, just giving you a sense of how strong [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=355.52s)]
*  it is. As I said, the government in Thailand holding an emergency meeting and you can imagine [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=362.4s)]
*  in Myanmar itself, there will be now an operation to try and get emergency services to the epicenter, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=366.79999999999995s)]
*  which as I say, is in the north west of the country in a city called Sagaing, which is [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=372.88s)]
*  near the city of Mandalay and that about 100 kilometres north of the capital, Napier door. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=379.52s)]
*  We have had reports from AFP journalists who are in Napier door, the capital, where they said roads [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  are buckled by the force of the tremors and chunks fell from ceilings. And we've seen those pictures [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=391.76s)]
*  of some damage on the roads in Myanmar. You can see them on the screen at the moment there. There [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  is damage on the roads. That would tie in with what the AFP journalists are saying, that they've [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=403.28s)]
*  seen roads in Napier door that are buckled by the force of the tremors. We've got those shots now at [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=408.56s)]
*  the moment actually we were just looking at. In fact, we're not quite sure at the moment where [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=413.84s)]
*  these pictures are coming into us, but that does look like a collapsed building at what looks like [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=418.24s)]
*  a construction site there. So these could be the pictures coming into us from Bangkok, but we're [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=423.12s)]
*  not sure yet. So, well, in fact, we've gone to black inevitably. This is always the case in these [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=428.32s)]
*  situations. We will start getting a lot of pictures in as the news agencies get their cameras and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=434.0s)]
*  we'll, as the BBC get cameras there. So details will come in, but we do know 7.7 magnitude earthquake. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTCG8o6Ssj4&t=439.2s)]
