# An AI Awakening With Profluent Bio's Hilary Eaton, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI)
*  Welcome back to the Business Biotech. I'm Matt Piller and I'm likely to get way out of my depth [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=0.0s)]
*  with today's guest in a big hurry, so it should be a fun listen. She's Chief Business Officer of a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=10.8s)]
*  new company that's a bit of a departure for us. The company's not, at least not right now, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=18.28s)]
*  developing a pipeline, but rather it's leveraging generative AI to do all sorts of useful things [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=24.56s)]
*  like reading and writing therapeutic proteins from scratch and making accessible to the biotech [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=33.32s)]
*  community an open-sourced AI-generated gene editor called OpenCRISPR. On today's show, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=39.48s)]
*  ProFluence, Dr. Hilary Eaton is with me and while I'm not going to let her take me too far into the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=47.08s)]
*  AI rabbit hole, we are going to learn a bit about how it works and importantly where and when it [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=54.44s)]
*  doesn't work, its applications in biotech, why ProFluent is doing what it's doing, much of it [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=61.64s)]
*  for free, I might add, and what's inspired Hilary's life science career path both personally and [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=68.36s)]
*  professionally. Hilary, welcome to the business of biotech. Thanks so much for having me. It's a [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=75.12s)]
*  pleasure to be here. I'm super excited that you're here to join us. I had the benefit of a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=80.64s)]
*  conversation with you for our listeners, just so you know, Hilary and I talked a couple weeks ago [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=86.24s)]
*  and I've been pumped to do this interview since we chatted because I was so excited and inspired by [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=89.76s)]
*  Hilary's enthusiasm. I'm setting the bar very high from the outset here, Hilary. You got to bring that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=96.0s)]
*  you got to bring your A game. But I want to start out with your a little bit about where you came [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=102.4s)]
*  from and what got you into the space in the first place. So a little bit of background, Hilary earned [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=108.56s)]
*  her PhD in molecular cancer biology from Duke. She did her postdoc at Harvard. And then Hilary, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=114.08s)]
*  you got seemingly like looking at it on paper, you got directly into licensing and business [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=120.48s)]
*  development deals. So that's where my curiosity gets piqued a little bit. What motivated this, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=126.16s)]
*  you know, what looked like a scientific or therapeutic sort of development driven path, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=131.36s)]
*  what motivated that switch early on into licensing and business development? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=137.12s)]
*  Yes, that's a good question. And I think, you know, the story is that it's always more messy [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=141.76s)]
*  behind the scenes than it is on paper. I am a bit of a poster child for don't know what I want to be [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=145.84s)]
*  when I grow up and maybe still don't know. When I think back to the extent I remember it to my [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=152.96s)]
*  decision to go to graduate school, it really comes back to science was in my family. So I grew up [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=159.6s)]
*  watching my dad. He was a career scientist, a chemist advisor for his entire life. And he headed [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=165.6s)]
*  the team that developed Lipitor, their famous cholesterol lowering drug. And I somehow got the, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=172.32s)]
*  you know, very mistaken idea that all scientists just work on drugs that millions of people take. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=178.72s)]
*  And that sounded great to me, right? That sounded like a really direct path of helping people. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=184.4s)]
*  And as a side note, I think now that I've become a parent myself, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=190.64s)]
*  this really does make me think carefully about sharing both my successes, but also my failures [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=194.56s)]
*  with my kids so that they don't get sort of like a skewed view that everything in life works out. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, when I had a follow up conversation with my dad, you know, I learned a lot about the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=205.12s)]
*  many projects he worked on that were not Lipitor that did not make it to the clinic. And it was a [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=210.88s)]
*  very, it was a very enlightening conversation about, you know, the ups and downs of a career [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=215.44s)]
*  that on paper can look like one very major success. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I mean, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=220.96s)]
*  that's a really good perspective, you know? Going through that with my kids right now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=227.20000000000002s)]
*  my daughter's about to go into college, my son's going into a second year of college, and they're, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=232.32s)]
*  you know, in that formative stage and their perception, you don't really often think about [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=235.76000000000002s)]
*  what their perception of what you do and how you do it might, how that might influence them. Like, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=240.4s)]
*  you just looked at dad as like the Lipitor making hero, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=245.6s)]
*  Yes. Lipitor making, Lipitor taking, he takes his own medicine. And so I kind of, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=249.12s)]
*  it was, it was sort of just a given that I was going to go to graduate school and sort of follow [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  in his footsteps. I mean, he was always so inspiring to me, but then sort of like back to [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=259.52s)]
*  the career pivot. So, you know, maybe halfway through my PhD and that sort of like, you've [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=263.92s)]
*  gotten through the prelim, you're now working in a lab. And I started realizing that a lot of the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=269.12s)]
*  basic science projects that are carried out in academic labs are never going to directly affect [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=274.8s)]
*  a patient's life. They're often very crucial steps to understanding the underlying mechanisms [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  or pathways that are affected by disease. But there, you know, there are many steps away from [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=286.40000000000003s)]
*  a medicine that's actually going to affect lives. And so during my postdoc at Harvard, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=292.16s)]
*  I started to search for a more direct way to help people. And I'm a big fan of thinking about sort [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=296.8s)]
*  of inflection points and also pondering on how sometimes what can be a pivotal point for you. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=303.44s)]
*  The other portion doesn't even realize that they said something that affected you. And I come back [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  to, there was a lunch and learn seminar with the then chief scientific officer of Dana-Farber [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=315.28s)]
*  Cancer Institute. His name was Barrett Rollins. And he probably doesn't even remember this, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=320.88s)]
*  but again, it made a huge impression on me at the time. And he was asked by somebody, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=324.96s)]
*  how did he become CSO? Like what was the transition from being a PI, being a lab head [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=329.36s)]
*  over to a more administrative managerial role? And in the course of his answer to that question, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=335.92s)]
*  he mentioned what was in principle a fairly simple exercise. It sounded like something that [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=342.8s)]
*  a career counselor would give you to do back in high school. And he said, you know, make a Venn [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  diagram and on the one side, have it be the things that you're good at versus the things [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=354.24s)]
*  that you're not and be honest. And then have the other side be a list of things you enjoy doing [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=359.28000000000003s)]
*  versus the types of things that you simply tolerate or maybe in fact hate. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=366.24s)]
*  And then he said, if you in your current role are not at that intersection between things you are [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=372.16s)]
*  good at and things you like doing, that does not mean that you are a failure at the thing you are [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=378.8s)]
*  trying to be. It means that your skill set and maybe your enthusiasm would probably be better [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=385.76s)]
*  fit for a different role. And that really struck me. And so I went home that night and made a [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=391.44s)]
*  Venn diagram. And first of all, it was a lot harder than I thought. Like getting honest with [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=397.76s)]
*  yourself about stuff that you aren't good at or that you don't like doing, that can sometimes be [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=402.0s)]
*  a little depressing too, to kind of look at the current job you're doing and the list of things [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=407.2s)]
*  you don't enjoy is much bigger than the list of things you do enjoy. But it gave me a hint about [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=412.64s)]
*  what to look for next. And that was exploring the business side of science, being able to still [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=419.2s)]
*  leverage the skills I'd learned throughout graduate school and my postdoc, but sort of applying [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=424.56s)]
*  some of my strengths in communication and in problem solving towards how could you make [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  medicines and get them successfully to patients. And so I started sort of on, you could say, the [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=436.48s)]
*  the light side of the dark side by dipping my toes into technology transfer at Dina Farber. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=443.68s)]
*  And that was really a crash course in many things that I had expected. I got to learn about [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  agreement negotiation, intellectual property, budgeting, alliance management, all things that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  I had never touched on as part of my scientific training. But surprisingly, I also got a crash [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=460.48s)]
*  course in expanding my scientific horizons. You work on these niche projects during your [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=466.56s)]
*  scientific training and so much interesting science goes on beyond your project or your [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=473.6s)]
*  department at a research institute. And so I got, honestly, a broader picture, I think, of the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=480.24s)]
*  science being done at Dina Farber during my time in tech transfer than I had as a postdoc [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=485.44s)]
*  with my head down working at the bench. And it was, you know, I found myself every night back on PubMed, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=490.48s)]
*  you know, trying to learn about new areas of science that I hadn't been trained in. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=496.32s)]
*  Like there was this new field called immunoncology. I knew nothing about it, but I got assigned a [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=499.92s)]
*  portfolio for a couple of lab heads that worked in that space. And it was absolutely fascinating [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=504.56s)]
*  to me to get to see kind of the best things, the most cutting edge things that were going on, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=510.8s)]
*  and then to try and figure out which one of those things had legs to become a company or to be [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=515.76s)]
*  licensed to a pharma to become a medicine. And that was my introduction to business development. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=521.36s)]
*  That's wild. When you after you had that exposure and a little bit of that experience, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=526.16s)]
*  how did that reshuffle the Venn diagram? Dexabet analogy, how did how did reshuffle the Venn [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=534.64s)]
*  diagram? Like if you were to do that Venn diagram over again, did you find like, oh, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=540.16s)]
*  the business side of things is kind of falling in a different place? Maybe the balance is a little [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=545.1999999999999s)]
*  bit different? Or was it I'm just curious about like how that that experience influenced? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=549.8399999999999s)]
*  I think, you know, no job is ever perfect. But I found that the balance skewed a lot more towards [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=556.48s)]
*  that sweet spot of things that I hope that I'm good at and things that I really fundamentally [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=561.76s)]
*  enjoy doing. It's whenever I give career advice to folks, you know, in my network, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=568.08s)]
*  it's that, you know, indescribable feeling. It's that like when I look at people, it's, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=575.12s)]
*  you can see when there's a sparkle in their eye, you can see when they're enjoying what they're [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=581.12s)]
*  doing in that moment. And you see times when that spark kind of dims, and it's just the rote grind. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=584.72s)]
*  And I don't know if there's ever going to be a job where your eyes are sparkling 100% of the time, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=589.6s)]
*  because that might just be complete burnout or just, you know, realistic. But I definitely [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=594.72s)]
*  noticed that there were a lot of things that brought that spark to my eye. This idea of, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=599.76s)]
*  you know, doing, for example, a deal negotiation. Ultimately, it's framed as you're on opposite [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=605.52s)]
*  sides of the table, right? And trying to get the best deal for your side of the table. But that's [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=614.48s)]
*  not really what it's all about. What you're trying to do is get at whatever science, whatever drug [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=620.56s)]
*  there is to be made there. And both of you want that. And each of you have some very real concerns [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=626.4s)]
*  about things that could go awry on the way to building that drug. And so figuring out sort of [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=632.4s)]
*  what the actual concerns are under the surface, and then finding creative ways to compromise [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=637.92s)]
*  about those, that to me is fun. It's, you know, it's a fun puzzle to work out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=642.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty cool. And I think the Venn diagram would probably help a lot of people, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=648.0s)]
*  because like I've had conversations with people who have your academic background, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=652.0799999999999s)]
*  who would decidedly say that that is not fun, Hillary, not fun at all, you know. So those [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=656.88s)]
*  exercises, I think it's good, like as your career goes on. And speaking of deal making, I think next [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=663.92s)]
*  stop on your career, you're doing big deals at Editas, right? Was that next after Dana Farber? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=668.24s)]
*  Editas was next. Yeah. Yeah. And during that time, you shared with me, and you said we could talk [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=674.08s)]
*  about this. It's personal, but you said we could talk about this. During that time, when you're [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=679.84s)]
*  doing these big deals for Editas, your career is starting to take off, you find out that you have, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=684.1600000000001s)]
*  in fact, a personal connection to rare genetic disease, a very, very personal connection. So [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  tell us a little bit about that story. I'm happy to actually. I think, you know, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=696.96s)]
*  honestly, if more people are able to be vulnerable and talk about their own experiences, [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=701.52s)]
*  it can sometimes help all of those folks out there who are living through similar things, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=705.92s)]
*  but feel so isolated because some of these things don't get talked about. So, you know, as I was [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=711.04s)]
*  looking at the Editas role in the background, my husband and I have been trying to have kids [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=717.12s)]
*  for some years without any success, and we ended up doing IVF. And so ironically, I was actually [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=723.28s)]
*  waking up from having my eggs harvested when I got the call from Deb Palastrand at Editas saying [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=730.0s)]
*  that she was offering me the job. And I just had a nurse who said, you know, OK, you've had [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=736.24s)]
*  general anesthesia, no big decisions, no driving. And then I got that call and I was like, yeah, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=740.08s)]
*  I'm taking, I'm making this decision. And so, you know, while I was at Editas, had two little IVF [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=744.48s)]
*  miracle babies and was just so grateful that the career that I had embarked upon and science was [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=751.12s)]
*  able to sort of make a dream come true for us. And then over the course, you know, it's so busy, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=758.4s)]
*  like two parents working full time in the biotech, you know, two young babies. And, you know, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=764.0799999999999s)]
*  it's just kind of like all the blur. But, you know, at some point along the way, we kind of [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=769.28s)]
*  experienced one of those like worst moments that you can have as a parent where all of a sudden [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=773.84s)]
*  you realize that your kid is missing developmental milestones. When it's your first kid, you don't [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=777.92s)]
*  really have much to compare it to, right? You don't have benchmarks out there. And so it's kind [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=783.52s)]
*  of like, you know, yeah, she's taken a while to sit up, but like, I don't know, there's a range. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=788.4s)]
*  Pediatrician every time tells you, oh, kids are a range. It's a whole spectrum, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=793.28s)]
*  But it was more prominent in our second daughter. And at this point, actually, I think I had [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=797.84s)]
*  transitioned to Vorbio and she had some hearing loss at birth, but it's so hard with babies to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=803.04s)]
*  figure out how profound certain things are. You know, they don't exactly cooperate on the exam [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=812.4s)]
*  table with various tests. And so it wasn't until she was nine or 10 months that we really realized [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=817.28s)]
*  how significant the hearing loss was. And there were a variety of other symptoms that kept popping [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=821.84s)]
*  up. But the biggest thing is, you know, we were in it at one of the hearing sessions and somebody [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=826.4s)]
*  says, you know, oh, could she sit by herself in the chair without you holding her? And I said, oh, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=831.52s)]
*  no, she can't sit up by herself. And they said, really? She's 10 months now. That's, you know, [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=835.84s)]
*  she should be able to sit. And so that led to being introduced to early intervention, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=840.8s)]
*  which the state of Massachusetts does when you have a child with two or more developmental delays [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=846.0799999999999s)]
*  and a whole host of additional specialists to look into why she was missing these gross motor and [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=851.12s)]
*  these fine motor milestones. And, you know, what it came down to in the end is that she was so [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=856.7199999999999s)]
*  hypermobile, so flexible that it was hard for her to build strength and figure out how to do [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=863.84s)]
*  some of these crucial things like sitting up or pulling to stand or crawling. And [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=871.0400000000001s)]
*  I can remember, you know, a point where I was in, I think it was an orthopedic office. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=877.6s)]
*  And Olivia, that point was, I think, maybe around 26 months and not walking. So significantly [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=884.0s)]
*  delayed and just feeling extremely frustrated because we had gone through sort of a laundry [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=892.16s)]
*  list of different pediatric specialties and nobody was giving us answers. And sitting in this office [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=897.04s)]
*  and the doctor returns and looks at me and says, mom, are you bendy? And I said, I mean, yes. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=903.6s)]
*  What does this have to do with this conversation? She was like, do you have party tricks? Like, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=912.64s)]
*  you know, you double jointed, can you bend joints backwards? And I said, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=916.0799999999999s)]
*  yeah. And she was like, I know what's going on here. She's like, there's this thing, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=919.6s)]
*  there's these host of connective tissue disorders where the most obvious symptom is this hypermobility. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=925.28s)]
*  And she's like, and I think what we've got going on here is that this little girl, you know, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=933.0400000000001s)]
*  is just so, so bendy without the corresponding strength, because how would she have built that up? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=937.6s)]
*  Right. I think that she needs, you know, some braces. She needs some braces on her ankles and [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=943.9200000000001s)]
*  just stabilizing some of those joints is going to really help with the immediate symptoms. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=948.72s)]
*  And it was just that moment of, could this really be it? Do we have some light donning? And so they [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=954.64s)]
*  fitted her with some custom orthotics and we kind of thought, yeah, try sticking your two-year-old [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=960.96s)]
*  in ankle braces. There's no way she'll take it. You know, this is going to be a grand tantrum. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=966.88s)]
*  And instead we had that moment in the office where they put the ankle braces on her and she [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=971.2s)]
*  turned and looked at me and then she pulled up to stand like, Mom, I was just waiting for this, [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=976.32s)]
*  you know? Yeah. A little support. Yeah. Yeah. And she was walking within like two weeks after that. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=982.72s)]
*  And so, you know, getting a diagnosis for a genetic disease is often a really long and [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=987.6800000000001s)]
*  discouraging process because there are so many of them and some of them come with such, you know, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=993.6s)]
*  amorphous constellation of symptoms. And so I think, you know, we got phenomenally lucky to [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=999.2s)]
*  be in Boston and to have some amazing physicians in our network that were able to get us there. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1004.96s)]
*  You know, but one of the issues here is that there aren't, just as there aren't treatments, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1010.5600000000001s)]
*  there are also not diagnostics for many of these things. So this particular disorder is called [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1016.64s)]
*  hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or HEDS for short. And for this particular subvariant of [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1024.8s)]
*  disease, there are no known genetic variants. So it's not, you can't just send a blood sample [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1032.24s)]
*  in and have a doctor say, yes, you have the mutation or no, you don't. Instead, they're [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1036.96s)]
*  looking down sort of, you know, a bucket list of clinical symptoms. And if you meet enough of the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1042.24s)]
*  criteria, then you're deemed to have a disease. And the thing is, my girls at the time, two and [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1047.2s)]
*  four, they were too young to have had some of the life experiences that would have led to some of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1052.64s)]
*  the symptoms like repeated dislocations, slow wound healing. And so the doctors came to me and [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1058.0s)]
*  said, you know, mom, an alternative approach here would be if you got officially diagnosed, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1065.44s)]
*  that would allow us to then diagnose your children. And so I found myself in a doctor's office at, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1071.12s)]
*  I don't know, 37 or something, you know, being asked all these questions. And all of a sudden, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1077.36s)]
*  so many different symptoms or weird medical things that had happened to me over the course [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1083.28s)]
*  of 37 years were drawn together into a diagnosis. And I still can remember, you know, the doctor [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1088.0s)]
*  near the end, the genesis at the end of the appointment said, you know, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1097.28s)]
*  heartwarming that you're doing this, you know, in order to get your kids, you know, diagnosed and [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1100.8799999999999s)]
*  on the path, you know, to ameliorating their symptoms. He was like, also, you've just been [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1105.28s)]
*  living with this for several decades. You're kind of screwed up health wise and you need doctors. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1110.56s)]
*  You need to go see specialists for some of these different conditions. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1118.3999999999999s)]
*  And I just thought it was too funny that progression sort of like to diagnosis that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1123.12s)]
*  like symptoms that I had experienced somehow weren't worth it to me or didn't rise above the [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1129.2s)]
*  radar to maybe I should go see a doctor about this. But when it was my kids, the mama bear [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1135.6799999999998s)]
*  comes out and you're like, OK, let's get this solved. Right. Yeah. So, yeah, that was that was [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1139.68s)]
*  the path to to getting diagnosed. You didn't call your mom and say, hey, thanks, mom, for not noticing [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1144.64s)]
*  that it's going to be 36 months to sit up in my high chair. Well, the funny thing was I had normal [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1149.3600000000001s)]
*  progression with motor development. What they're finding with a lot of these these disorders is [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1154.96s)]
*  that you see something that's called anticipation with generations. So maybe grandma has it. Mom has [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1160.16s)]
*  it a little worse. Kid has it a little bit worse. And so it actually made a lot of sense. It's [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1167.04s)]
*  actually led to our whole extended family being tested because, you know, there's the part of this [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1172.08s)]
*  journey that's getting an answer for yourself. There's also a part of this journey that's how [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1178.1599999999999s)]
*  can you help the broader community? So when somebody shows up in a clinic and there's no [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1183.68s)]
*  family history of any of these symptoms, it's very hard then to look for what in their DNA might be [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1188.96s)]
*  causing these symptoms. Sure. When you have a large extended family with folks who are, quote, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1196.16s)]
*  unquote, normal and folks who are less normal, you can start finding patterns where you can say, OK, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1201.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, maybe we have seventy five thousand snips or random mutations in our genome, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1207.52s)]
*  but there's this only this one snip that's in the affected females in this family. So, you know, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1213.8400000000001s)]
*  we saw it as both answers for ourselves, but just as my husband and I are both scientists, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1219.8400000000001s)]
*  my dad's a scientist, we had this immense curiosity about what is causing this and can [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1224.4s)]
*  we add to the knowledge in the field? Were you already thinking about the impact of data sets [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1230.0s)]
*  in science and in life sciences and therapeutic development when you experienced this or did it [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1236.88s)]
*  sort of inform your perspective on data sets? Boy, data sets are really important to therapeutic [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1243.0400000000002s)]
*  development. It's a little bit of both. I mean, during my time at Dena Farber, one of the things [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1249.6s)]
*  that came up is that, you know, they treat so many patients every year and there's data from [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1254.7199999999998s)]
*  treatment outcomes, there's data on symptoms, there's also data in the form of actual patient [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1262.3999999999999s)]
*  samples like bio specimens. And you learn a lot from seeing how somebody's tissue changes over [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1268.1599999999999s)]
*  the course of disease progression and then treatment. And so one of the things that we [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1273.84s)]
*  worked on at Dena Farber is making sure that when you're writing up IRB consents, IRB protocols [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1278.0s)]
*  to enroll patients in clinical trials, that you can really explain to them how valuable their data [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1284.56s)]
*  is and how it might be used in the development of new medicines and what precautions you take to [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1290.0s)]
*  keep the right privacy around that data. And then to find myself sitting on the patient side of that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1296.0s)]
*  seat, you know, reading patient consents that I might've had a hand in writing, you know, it [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1301.28s)]
*  hits hard. And there can be that instinct of like, no, no, my genes are mine. My information is my [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1306.88s)]
*  own private. And I respect people very much who make that decision. I think maybe, you know, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1313.2800000000002s)]
*  somewhat uniquely because of the science background, part of me said, yeah, I'll put it all on the [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1318.8000000000002s)]
*  table. If somebody can learn something from my cells, my DNA, that means there's a mom down the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1323.1200000000001s)]
*  line whose baby is diagnosed at birth and who learns some of these, you know, developmental [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1329.5200000000002s)]
*  things on a regular schedule. I will have contributed in, you know, in a meaningful way that has, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1336.08s)]
*  you know, nothing to do with like a personal achievement at all. It's just something that's [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  like inherent in my body. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Before I ask you the next question, how are your [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1346.24s)]
*  girls doing today? How are they doing now? They are doing phenomenally. So, you know, one of the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1350.96s)]
*  things that we've really tried to do is treat the medical world. It takes a village, let's put it [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1355.4399999999998s)]
*  that way. And we've assembled together a team of specialists that track throughout, how do I put [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1361.12s)]
*  this? You know, you have connective tissue in literally every place in your body. So there are [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1368.08s)]
*  a whole range of things that can go wrong with this disease. And it used to be that they would [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1374.0s)]
*  only pick up patients fairly late in life. I think the last quote that I heard from the patient [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1380.9599999999998s)]
*  community is that the average time to diagnosis for Ehlers-Danlos is 14 years. So you're often [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1386.16s)]
*  dealing with folks in sort of young to mid adulthood. Now Boston Children's Hospital is [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1392.64s)]
*  seeing a lot of much younger kids coming in and they don't really know what disease progression [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1398.4s)]
*  it's going to look like. They don't know how early certain symptoms are going to pop up. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1403.52s)]
*  And so, you know, we just made sure that we got, you know, the right team in place [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1407.44s)]
*  with regular check-in schedules. And it's, you know, we'll solve problems. It can be a little [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1411.92s)]
*  bit like whack-a-mole because, you know, you think you've gotten to a good state and then something [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1418.56s)]
*  new pops up. But I think I'm just so incredibly lucky that I have this network of friends and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1422.08s)]
*  colleagues and former colleagues that I can draw on when some of these new things pop up to figure [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1429.12s)]
*  out, you know, how to frame the approach. It's, you know, something happens. So figure out how [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1434.56s)]
*  to solve it, figure out who the people are to talk to. And they're just, they're doing wonderfully. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1440.8799999999999s)]
*  They're both in school now. They're just really thriving. And in some ways, you know, as much as [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1446.32s)]
*  I was, you know, sad to find out that I have a disease that I had passed on to them, you know, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1453.44s)]
*  my therapist, my executive coach, all my friends, the point to drive home is that who better to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1459.92s)]
*  parent a child with rare disease than a mom who already knows what it's like to live, like, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1466.3200000000002s)]
*  there's nobody better to advocate for them. Sure. Yeah. And to demonstrate the strength [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1471.68s)]
*  that's possible in spite of the disease, right? 100%. 100%. Because I, that is one aspect of my [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1476.4s)]
*  persona, that I have a rare disease that does not define me. Does it limit me perhaps in certain [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1485.12s)]
*  ways? But you know, it's interesting to figure out how you can sort of like find hacks or band-aids [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1493.28s)]
*  or approaches that allow you to, to ambitiously go after your career goals while still dealing [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1499.28s)]
*  with some of these things that are happening in the background. Sometimes I almost think that maybe [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1506.8s)]
*  that in and of itself is what led to me having certain strengths in my career and business [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1511.28s)]
*  development, because I'm not afraid to go out there and advocate for things and ask the hard [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1517.28s)]
*  questions and try to come up with creative solutions. Yeah. Well, I hope you're still buying [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1521.76s)]
*  a, an annual bottle of wine for that pediatrician who asked you if you're Bendy, because thank, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1527.68s)]
*  thank God for her. That's fantastic. Absolutely. Yeah. We need to get back on the career track [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1532.8s)]
*  here, right? You said you were, the move from Editas to Vore. So that was Vore and Tome, I think, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1540.48s)]
*  were the next, next two stops on your, on your journey. Tell us a little bit about why you made [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1547.84s)]
*  those switches. Yeah. And so it's interesting. I've definitely had some mentors along the way [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1551.76s)]
*  who've advised me to, to branch out or to generalize. You know, I, I kind of, you know, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1557.84s)]
*  when I took the job at Editas, I honestly didn't even understand what CRISPR, gene editing, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1564.88s)]
*  was. It was, you know, a technology in its infancy. I had a couple of postdoc friends [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1570.56s)]
*  who were using it for screening, but I had no idea that it was going to become sort of a next [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1575.4399999999998s)]
*  frontier in genetic medicines. And as I looked, you know, at beyond Editas, I, again, these mentors [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1580.48s)]
*  were saying, okay, you, you've had, you know, an incredibly successful stint at, you know, one of [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1590.0s)]
*  the pioneering editing companies do something else to, you know, go into a different area of [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1595.76s)]
*  technology or a different area of disease. But for me, when I looked at the field, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1600.08s)]
*  there is so many good science, there's so many other good things, particularly around the Boston [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1608.16s)]
*  area that you could go for, but I do not see any other path to alleviating or even curing [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1611.76s)]
*  rare genetic disease that's more promising than gene editing in its many forms. And, and so I've [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1618.08s)]
*  stayed put, you know, that's definitely been a theme for me staying at companies that are [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1623.44s)]
*  exploring with different generations of gene editing systems. And, and in many ways, it kind [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1627.68s)]
*  of feels like that, you know, is the perfect intersection of life experiences for me that, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1635.68s)]
*  you know, I'm trained as a scientist and fundamentally gene editing is not an easy or [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1640.88s)]
*  process. It is, you know, a very intricate, intricate system, complex biology. And in my [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1646.64s)]
*  job as in business development, I really never knew, know who I'm going to have to explain or [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1653.44s)]
*  interpret to. I could be dealing with a Nobel prize winning scientist who wants all the details, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1658.96s)]
*  or I could be dealing with somebody who has more of a finance background and, and needs it to be, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1663.76s)]
*  you know, explained in a simpler manner that they'll be able to, to, to deal with. And so, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1667.92s)]
*  you know, you've got that part of it. And then on the deal negotiation side, you know, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1674.64s)]
*  one of the things that's been really interesting then is, is getting to see as this, you know, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1679.2s)]
*  field of gene editing has started blossoming over the last decade or so, you know, seeing what it [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1684.3200000000002s)]
*  takes to have success or not in the field of biotech startup, seeing, you know, that combination of [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1689.44s)]
*  good people and good ideas and good strategy and how some of those things pan out, like what [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1696.4s)]
*  decisions you make with the data you have in hand at the time versus what decisions, you know, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1702.48s)]
*  you might've made if you'd had 2020 hindsight. And then finally, that patient perspective, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1706.4s)]
*  right? It is, you know, I remember the, the, the clinical indication selection exercise at Editas, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1711.68s)]
*  and it's very patient driven. It's very patient focused, but that patient is also other, [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1719.28s)]
*  that patient is sort of, you know, cut and dry facts that are on a piece of paper. What is the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1727.1200000000001s)]
*  disease progression look like? What are the symptoms? What's the underlying genetic mutation? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1732.16s)]
*  Can our technology fix that mutation? And once you get a diagnosis, the psychology of that exercise [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1736.4s)]
*  is so very different because it becomes, you know, that, that could be my daughter. How are [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1743.76s)]
*  we approaching this safely? Is this, you know, can we, with, with the way that clinical trials need to [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1750.0s)]
*  be set up, are we going to be able to intervene early enough in that child's life to have meaningful [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1756.0s)]
*  clinical benefit? It just, you know, it changes the equation. And so I think, you know, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1761.84s)]
*  one of the things- The equation and a sense of, like does it, does it up your sense of urgency? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1766.72s)]
*  Definitely ups the sense of urgency of impact. And I, you know, I've seen folks out there on, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1772.08s)]
*  on LinkedIn and X, you know, talk about the explosion of gene editing companies and we do, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1779.4399999999998s)]
*  do we really need that many? You know, but I would argue yes. Yeah. There can't be too many [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1784.08s)]
*  companies, right? There, there are so many rare diseases and so many patients out there who are [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1789.84s)]
*  looking for, for answers that I, you know, I really don't think there can be. And it also then has [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  changed in certain ways the way I view the business of medicine, right? It's phenomenal to see, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1800.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, like the Cas-Jebby, the first approved medicine, CRISPR medicine for, for sickle cell [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1808.8799999999999s)]
*  that CRISPR therapeutics and vertex, you know, brought to the clinic, seeing folks get cured [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1814.32s)]
*  and, and, and no longer having these horrible Viso occlusive episodes with, you know, pain and, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1820.08s)]
*  and blocked blood vessels, that is amazing to see. And, and those drugs are, are priced accordingly. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1826.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars of research go into, you know, every one successful [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1833.04s)]
*  drug has 99 failures sitting in the background. And yet when you look around the world, you know, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1838.8s)]
*  the, the patient population of folks with rare disease is not limited to, you know, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1845.2s)]
*  rich people in developed countries that have great insurance. It's the gamut, nobody's spared, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1851.84s)]
*  right? And so you start thinking about, you know, we are very early in the arc of a new technology. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1857.52s)]
*  Things are usually most expensive at the beginning because they're so new. And you see, [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1864.8s)]
*  you know, as things become more common and commoditized, you do see prices come down, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  but it, you know, it really did start and get me thinking about like, how do we, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1873.52s)]
*  Jennifer Doudna and her innovative genome Institute, right? This idea of democratization, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  how do you take such a powerful technology that has the applications that go way beyond human [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1884.8799999999999s)]
*  therapeutics? When you think about sustainable crops, climate change, and how do you, you [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1889.6s)]
*  responsibly use it for some of these things? How do you use it for the betterment of society? And [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1894.9599999999998s)]
*  how do you do it in a way that's approachable for as many patients as possible? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1899.28s)]
*  You're, you're doing a beautiful job. God, you're a great storyteller. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1903.6799999999998s)]
*  Fantastic storyteller. And you're doing, and you're doing a great job setting up the, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1907.9199999999998s)]
*  my segue to the next career pivot. I talked to a lot of physician scientists turned biotech [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1913.28s)]
*  founders and they tell me, well, you know, I was administering the thing and the things. And then [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1923.2s)]
*  I made the decision to get into biotech or biopharma because I wanted to make the thing, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1929.36s)]
*  right? That I was administering. So here you are, you're, you're working for companies that are [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1935.12s)]
*  making the things, a few of them in a row and doing well. I'll add a great business development [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1939.9199999999998s)]
*  career with these companies doing what a lot of people aspire to do, making the thing, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1948.08s)]
*  developing the thing. And then what last, last year, early this year, you decide, [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1953.4399999999998s)]
*  now I want to go do something else. And it's not with a company who's making a thing per se in, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1960.24s)]
*  in the context of, you know, in terms of a therapeutic. I know, like I said, I think you [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1965.92s)]
*  were sort of leading into that question when you were talking about these bigger problems, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1971.28s)]
*  you know, these bigger challenges that your current company, ProFluent is [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1977.2s)]
*  attempting to play a key piece in the puzzle, right, of solving. So tell us about that. What, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1982.4s)]
*  what prompted and how was like, what was going on in your mind? What did you struggle with when you [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1988.16s)]
*  said, you know what, like, I think I'm going to move away from working in BD for, for therapeutic [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1992.8s)]
*  development companies in the gene editing space. And I'm going to jump on this. I won't say, yeah, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=1998.0s)]
*  yeah, yeah. And I was going to, yeah, I don't want to call it a bandwagon. I mean, yeah, I'm, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2005.44s)]
*  I'm, I'm fully on board that bandwagon and I don't even want to call it nascent. Like it's, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2010.24s)]
*  it's here, right? It's happening. So, but, but still big transition for you, big decision, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2014.72s)]
*  right? Walk away from therapeutics development and, and, and take on a risky role with a startup [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2019.44s)]
*  company that, you know, doesn't really have a product per se when you joined, like what was [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2025.3600000000001s)]
*  going on there? Yes. And so, I mean, as, as you said, you know, I was, I was drawn to the previous [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2031.04s)]
*  companies to Editas, to Vor and Tome because they were all, you know, pioneering incredible [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2036.48s)]
*  editing technologies and, and turning those into medicines for, for rare disease, for, for immune [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2042.48s)]
*  disorders, for, for cancer. And as I experienced both those specific company builds, but also [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2048.32s)]
*  sort of getting the bird's eye view of the developing gene editing field as a whole, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2057.76s)]
*  I, one of the things that I was struck by is, is a pattern of needing a new approach to protein [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2063.44s)]
*  engineering. So why, why would we need a new approach? What wasn't working or what isn't [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2070.7200000000003s)]
*  working? So in many cases, CRISPR being one of them, the starting point for a therapeutic [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2075.6s)]
*  is a protein sequence that has essentially been copied and pasted from nature. And often it's, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2081.7599999999998s)]
*  it's, it's by random chance or discovery. It's not that somebody's trying to find that particular [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2087.44s)]
*  thing in nature. It's that it's, you know, somebody's working in bacteria and then discovers this thing [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2093.36s)]
*  that does something and they start thinking, huh, how could that be applied? Could that be applied [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2098.64s)]
*  to human medicine? Now, the tricky thing is that, you know, a protein that evolved in nature to [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2103.12s)]
*  carry out a certain function might not be the perfectly designed solution for a given human [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2111.52s)]
*  use case that you're looking for. And so, you know, if we want to adjust the function, how do [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2118.7999999999997s)]
*  we go about doing that? We need to tweak it slightly. How do we go about doing that? And so [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2124.56s)]
*  there are sort of, you know, different approaches or different eras of protein engineering. It's [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2128.32s)]
*  not a new thing. It's been going on for decades, right? So one is sort of the manual route where [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2132.96s)]
*  you could carry out random mutagenesis or directed evolution. And, you know, trying to guide the [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2138.2400000000002s)]
*  protein towards those criteria you're looking for, this is incredibly time and resource intensive. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2146.32s)]
*  It often is sort of, you know, again, random mutagenesis does not really imply that you have [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2152.72s)]
*  much of a hypothesis. It's your sort of like randomly tinkering with different areas of the [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2157.68s)]
*  protein to see if you then get results that you want. And often what you end up getting is [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2161.7599999999998s)]
*  incremental improvements at best. More often you break the protein because you tinker with a [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2167.04s)]
*  fundamental area of it that's necessary for function. And so, you know, then maybe moving [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2173.12s)]
*  on to the next era or sort of a different approach, we've got folks who do metagenomic mining. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2179.2s)]
*  What does that mean? Well, they look at, you know, I lifted this particular sequence from this [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2185.7599999999998s)]
*  particular organism. It's almost right, but it doesn't do these other things we want it to. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2190.08s)]
*  So I just need to broaden my search. I need to look at more organisms. And in the diversity [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2195.3599999999997s)]
*  of organisms, eventually I'll find something that does have my list of criteria. And certainly some [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2199.52s)]
*  folks have had success, you know, looking into, you know, volcanoes and ice floes for more genetic [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2205.28s)]
*  diversity. But I would still argue that that is a fairly needle in a haystack approach. And it often [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2212.0800000000004s)]
*  results in functional tradeoffs. And so what do I mean by that? So when you look at natural [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2218.6400000000003s)]
*  evolutionary processes, often the selection pressure that's being put, that leads to sequence [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2225.6000000000004s)]
*  changes, it's focused on one particular attribute of that protein, of that enzyme. So for example, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2232.0s)]
*  perhaps the host organism is small. So the enzyme itself needs to be smaller. It just isn't going to [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2238.56s)]
*  fit. It's not going to be able to do its job. But in the process of evolving and achieving that [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2244.16s)]
*  smaller size, it's possible, I'd argue even probable, that other aspects of that protein's [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2249.12s)]
*  function are going to be altered. And so change is kind of like a double-edged sword in this [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2256.08s)]
*  scenario. It's, you know, you achieve one goal, but you sacrifice other features that weren't [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2260.64s)]
*  critical for fixing the current problem in that original organism or survival of that organism. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2265.6s)]
*  But they are key for the therapeutic problem that you want to solve. And so, you know, in comes [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2272.16s)]
*  profluent and generative AI, which I'll be frank, I knew nothing about. I'm a huge sci-fi aficionado, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2277.8399999999997s)]
*  but I knew nothing about real life AI before being introduced to profluent. And, you know, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2286.08s)]
*  one of my first thoughts is this is the next era of protein design, where we're moving away from [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2293.52s)]
*  sort of accidental discovery or sort of, you know, tinkering around in a manual way. And we're really [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2299.2799999999997s)]
*  moving to intentional bespoke design aided by artificial intelligence. And, you know, they have [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2305.7599999999998s)]
*  these large language models and those large language models, they're not limited by natural [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2313.84s)]
*  sequences. They don't involve manual labor. There's no functional trade-off. It's when you look at the [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2320.96s)]
*  combinatorial space of a single protein, it's greater than the number of atoms in the world. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2327.92s)]
*  And so there's no way that even a team of the best scientists can sit down and explore all the [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2334.4s)]
*  possible sequences, right? But generative AI can do that in a matter of minutes, right? It helps you [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2339.44s)]
*  narrow the funnel of what could be possible, places evolution hasn't had a chance to explore [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2345.52s)]
*  and pull the gems out. And so rather than sort of starting with a molecule and then trying to kind [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2351.52s)]
*  of like jam it into a therapeutic use case that it may not be quite perfect for, but it's sort of [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2357.92s)]
*  good enough, we're really trying to kind of flip that paradigm for drug development upside down. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2362.32s)]
*  Start with the problem. What is the problem you're trying to fix? And then if you had to imagine the [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2367.76s)]
*  perfect drug that would fix exactly that problem, what characteristics would it have? And once you [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2373.28s)]
*  have that list of criteria that you think define the ideal system, then we task the AI with building [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2379.92s)]
*  exactly that thing. And that just blew my mind that could that even work? Right? [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2388.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. I'm going to bounce around here with my questions because I'm going to go with like [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2393.2799999999997s)]
*  there's primacy and recency. Ask questions about something you said earlier. I'm going to go with [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2399.6s)]
*  recency. Okay. This description that you just illustrated, start with the problem and then [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2403.2s)]
*  ask what are the attributes of the solution to that problem and then go out there and use the data. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2411.7599999999998s)]
*  It seems to me in that situation, the data, at least at this point in time, might be the weak link. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2418.08s)]
*  Or the strong link, depending on... [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2427.2s)]
*  Yeah. So let's talk about that. Like I said, I'll probably bounce around here for a minute [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2431.36s)]
*  because I'm already in over my head, but hey, here we are. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2436.16s)]
*  Where does the data come from? Like where does the data come from? And like in that scenario, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2441.2s)]
*  do we have, do you think enough data to make impact? Like to query, to apply these models and [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2448.56s)]
*  make impact? Yes. So I will caveat by saying that I am not too unlike you. I am definitely in over [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2456.16s)]
*  my head and anything I know about AI, I have learned from my team members, but especially from [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2462.3199999999997s)]
*  our investor. My listeners are calling your bluff right now. They've been hearing from you for the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2468.08s)]
*  past 45 minutes and they're like, this woman is not anywhere near over her head. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2474.24s)]
*  It's definitely sort of like a fire hose, right? The beginning of a new job, picking stuff up. And [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2482.4s)]
*  we're lucky enough, we have a board member named Fraser Kelton, who was the former head of product [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2486.72s)]
*  at OpenAI for ChatGPT in Dali. And then Profluent's own CEO and co-founder, Ali Madani, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2492.96s)]
*  who was one of the leading researchers at Salesforce that did all of this foundational [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2499.36s)]
*  work on applying large language models for protein generation. And so they've definitely helped [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2503.84s)]
*  bring things down to my level in terms of understanding what are large language models [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2510.2400000000002s)]
*  and how did it go from an area? If you look back five, 10 years ago, your iPhone model, I don't know, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2515.6s)]
*  two, three, couldn't finish a sentence for you. It's predictions, right? Were often hilarious. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2524.72s)]
*  I would sometimes just take the prediction because it was so hilariously wrong, right? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2530.8s)]
*  So how did we get from that world to a point where we have something like ChatGPT where you can say, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2534.56s)]
*  write me an essay in Shakespearean style on soccer, and it needs to be two pages long. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2541.04s)]
*  And it can just do that, right? That it seems like an incredible advancement. How did we get there? [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2547.04s)]
*  And as they describe it, the two key ingredients, one really is fundamentally advancements in AI. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2552.24s)]
*  There's something called the transformer algorithm that apparently had a profound [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2559.8399999999997s)]
*  effect on models ability to learn and generate useful results. But the second key ingredient [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2563.2s)]
*  is what you are alluding to, it's data. It's the scale of data. It's the quality of the data. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2570.56s)]
*  It's the bias or lack of bias in the data. And so when you think of how things like ChatGPT were [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2576.64s)]
*  able to have success, there are millions, if not billions of examples of text floating around on [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2584.32s)]
*  the internet in books, all these different things, right? And so that's a rich abundance [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2590.96s)]
*  for the model to scrape and learn from and learn just by like, when you think of a young child [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2596.16s)]
*  learning language, right? Some of it's intentional teaching, but a lot of it's just passive [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2602.72s)]
*  absorption. They hear things, they learn grammar unconsciously, and that's what these models do. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2607.8399999999997s)]
*  And so now if we turn to the world of protein discovery, that same abundance is mirrored in [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2612.48s)]
*  nature. The world has provided us with this abundance of natural protein sequences over [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2619.04s)]
*  the course of evolution. And much of that data is just readily available. It's just out there. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2625.3599999999997s)]
*  It's public. I guess that's part of my question though. Is it analog? Is that data that's out [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2630.32s)]
*  there in nature? I think the publishing industry certainly was an early to the internet, early to [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2636.96s)]
*  the cloud industry. I haven't been around the life sciences space long enough to know that [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2644.8s)]
*  they were jumping on that bandwagon from the outset and saying, all the data, all the data, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2651.84s)]
*  all of it, it needs to go. It needs to be digitized and it needs to become accessible. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2657.52s)]
*  So I think that's kind of central to my question. Yeah. So I would say that there are ways in which [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  some data doesn't exist. And we can get into that, I think later, maybe when we talk about [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2669.52s)]
*  negative data, when it comes to things that are natural sequences, as opposed to a drug that [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2675.68s)]
*  somebody's trying to develop, when we think about what exists in natural sequences, yes, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2683.36s)]
*  there is so much data out there that's digitized. Our current frontier model is being trained on [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2689.36s)]
*  over 80 billion protein sequences that are just out there. I can't say that they're often [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2695.76s)]
*  perfectly curated or ready to go. So there's a lot of intentional mining, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2704.96s)]
*  tidying, curation that needs to go when you pull down this information from all of these different [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2713.04s)]
*  sources, both public and proprietary, so that it is apples to apples and your model can actually [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2717.76s)]
*  learn from it. But there's so much of that that exists out there. And that's what we call unsupervised [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2724.48s)]
*  data. This is just sort of like, you want to expose your model to as many examples as possible, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2729.2s)]
*  so we can start playing little childlike games over and over trillions of times. Think of it like [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2735.2799999999997s)]
*  fill in the blank exercises, where if I say the girl kicked, you have learned that probably [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2741.6s)]
*  something's going to come after that. It could be the ball, it could be her brother, but there's a [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2748.64s)]
*  narrower universe of things that could come in that fill in the blank than if you just started [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2753.3599999999997s)]
*  a sentence with the. And so in the same way with these protein sequences, the model as it's exposed [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2757.36s)]
*  to it, it's learning the language, it's learning the syntax and grammar, it's learning what protein [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2763.28s)]
*  domains are responsible for what functions, it's seeing evolutionary dead ends where things didn't [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2768.08s)]
*  work. And ultimately what it comes out with is the ability to write things from scratch. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2773.44s)]
*  So I'll be very clear here, our models are not starting with a existing sequence and then [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2778.8s)]
*  performing the AI version of targeted mutagenesis. They are being fed input where you say, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2786.08s)]
*  I have this therapeutic problem to solve it. I need an enzyme with these qualities. And it says, [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2793.6s)]
*  okay, let's start with amino acid one. If I know what I want the end protein to be capable of doing, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2799.52s)]
*  what should the next amino acid be? What should the next amino acid be? And it generates [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2807.12s)]
*  millions of these possibilities and then ranks them based on its own prediction of how [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2811.52s)]
*  confident it is that that's going to be a successful hit. And that's where the second [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2818.64s)]
*  type of data comes into play. So you have this unsupervised natural data that you're exposing [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2823.28s)]
*  the model to, to train it, right? Now you have supervised lab data. So there's this sort of like [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2828.4s)]
*  feed forward loop where if our models have generated certain sequences and they think, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2834.96s)]
*  the model thinks that these are going to be, you know, CRISPR analogs, for example, right? Now you [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2841.2s)]
*  have to go test them, right? So you take the top five and maybe a couple sprinkled around that it [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2846.16s)]
*  doesn't think are going to be as good and you put them into the wet lab and you run functional [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2850.88s)]
*  assays and you see how they perform in real life. And now you've gone from like the theoretical, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2855.68s)]
*  the hypotheticals, like rubber beats the road. Like what does this actually look like in practice? [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2860.48s)]
*  And when you get those results back, that supervised data, it's labeled data. So you feed [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2865.12s)]
*  that data, positive or negative, back into the model and it learns which of its things were [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2871.28s)]
*  successful, which ones weren't, and maybe it sees patterns in terms of why, what made the successes [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2877.2s)]
*  a success and vice versa, right? And so, you know, it then learns from that data. I think that's a [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2882.56s)]
*  really interesting point that ties into sort of, you know, the idea around both is there enough [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2889.36s)]
*  data and what kinds of data are there? I think, you know, in the field of biotech and medicine, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2895.84s)]
*  there is an emphasis on successful data. That's what gets you papers. That's what gets you drugs, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2903.36s)]
*  right? Publish or perish. And yet in the field of tech, there is a very different attitude towards [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2909.2000000000003s)]
*  quote unquote failure. It's, you know, move fast, break things, learn from them, right? And that [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2917.12s)]
*  view of when something fails, you can learn from it. The models will learn something. So it's not [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2922.96s)]
*  a waste of time. It is in fact very valuable. If your models were only exposed to positive data, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2928.3199999999997s)]
*  that would not be a good thing. They would not be as well-rounded. And so that for me was a very [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2933.68s)]
*  interesting psychological shift that you're almost, you know, as intrigued by negative results as you [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2939.12s)]
*  are by positive results. Yeah. And I've, I mean, I've heard anecdotally as far as you can imagine, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2945.52s)]
*  a JP Morgan last January, AI was, there was a lot of buzz about AI and there were, I sat in on [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2952.32s)]
*  multiple discussions with folks who talked about that drought, I guess, of bad data and that being [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2959.04s)]
*  like potentially a pretty serious problem to the industry's embrace of this technology. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2966.64s)]
*  Um, no, and I want to ask you a question about that. Like you're, you're so convincing, Hillary, [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2973.68s)]
*  like I'm listening to you and I'm like, why would anyone be skeptical? Can you answer that question [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2979.76s)]
*  for me? Why, why, why is there so much skepticism? Yeah. And I'm happy to. Um, and I, you know, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2987.76s)]
*  I probably would say that I might count myself, you know, or I would have counted myself, you know, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2993.92s)]
*  I certainly had heard about AI was creeping into some of the conferences that I was going to in [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=2998.72s)]
*  some of my former companies, but I don't think I, you know, I didn't understand it. I think that's [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3005.04s)]
*  the root of a lot of skepticism. Like whenever you see something new come around, often there, [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3010.72s)]
*  you know, there's a lot of top level messaging or, or miscommunication around what something is and [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  what it isn't that can lead to a lot of this confusion or skepticism. So, you know, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3024.0s)]
*  first off, I would say it depends on the exact question that you're trying to answer. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3028.8s)]
*  So if you're talking about skeptics who just think that AI in general and or for biologics [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3033.04s)]
*  is just total hype and not, not, not actually reality, you know, I would say like, is AI a magic [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3039.28s)]
*  wand that you can just wave at a difficult therapeutic problem that your best team's been [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3045.92s)]
*  trying to solve for 20 years and it just instantly solved? No, it's not. So if that's the type of hype [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3050.08s)]
*  we're talking about, then I would probably agree, right? Is AI a highly complementary tool that can [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3056.24s)]
*  be used to augment the pace of innovation in science and in therapeutics? I think, I think yes. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3064.48s)]
*  And the key that I see there to it having a realistic impact, and it is having that now [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3071.52s)]
*  to be clear, is collaboration. It's not some machine learning scientists like locked away in [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3079.68s)]
*  their cubicle coding and then coming out and saying, aha, I've solved, you know, cancer. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3086.0s)]
*  It's this tight collaboration of folks on the AI machine learning side working with biologists, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3091.8399999999997s)]
*  manufacturers, clinicians in whatever the biological vertical is and saying, look, you know the problem. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3098.08s)]
*  You have intimate knowledge of how to design a therapy, what a clinical trial looks like. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3104.3199999999997s)]
*  Tell me things, tell me what your ideal attributes are, and I will translate that into what the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3109.9199999999996s)]
*  model needs to be exposed to and what types of output that it's spitting out. And when you have [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3116.64s)]
*  that tight collaboration, particularly when you're talking, you know, in our case about CRISPR and AI, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3120.8799999999997s)]
*  those are two, you know, hyped up, sexy, inflammatory topics, right? But then disruption [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3125.9199999999996s)]
*  plus disruption, you know, where's that going to take us? I think that's phenomenal. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3132.08s)]
*  Maybe building on the second point, then you also you have folks who think that it's powerful, [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3138.24s)]
*  but don't really understand how it works. And so then have that sort of level of skepticism. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3144.24s)]
*  Maybe it's not skepticism. Maybe it's just not understanding how to apply it, right? Excited, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3148.88s)]
*  but don't know how to apply it. And I think my executive coach would say reframe your skepticism [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3153.68s)]
*  as curiosity, right? You know, it's really a two way street here. And I don't know where the [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3159.52s)]
*  burden lies, but I would say there's some responsibility for leaders in AI to educate [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3164.08s)]
*  both society, but specifically the broader scientific community about exactly what AI is and isn't. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3169.92s)]
*  How it can- Well, I think, I mean, I think the burden, you know, the burden, where the burden [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3176.56s)]
*  lies probably has yet to be, yet to mature to the point of burden. But I think it's going to come [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3180.24s)]
*  real quick, right? Like if the burden is going to fall, the burden is going to fall on drug [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3185.2s)]
*  developers when they see other drug developers developing drugs. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3188.64s)]
*  It absolutely is. And to not just like brush it off as sci-fi, but like, you know, on the other [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3192.96s)]
*  side of the coin, on the developer side, there does also need to be that spark or that curiosity [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3197.44s)]
*  around, I want to learn more about this technology. I'm interested in how it could help me. It's one [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3201.6s)]
*  of those things where when somebody tells you that you can just go boop, boop, boop on a computer, [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3207.2799999999997s)]
*  and you're going to get some, you know, perfect proteins, potentially perfect proteins spat out, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3213.7599999999998s)]
*  there's that innate sort of like, oh, hell no. Like, you know what I mean? I've been doing this [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3218.08s)]
*  for years and I have spent, you know, time, blood, sweat trying to make these therapeutics. There's [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3222.48s)]
*  not, how is it possible that like a robot can do this? Right. And then you see it in action. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3227.92s)]
*  And if you're able to get over that kind of sense of like jealousy or, you know, sort of like, how [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3234.56s)]
*  is this possible? This invalidates everything I've been working on personally, right. And see the [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3241.04s)]
*  promise of where that could be taken with, you know, tight collaboration and supervision and [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3245.92s)]
*  guidance, you start to see, oh my goodness, we could take some of the most naughty problems that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3251.76s)]
*  folks have been, because what is the ultimate goal? The ultimate goal is not how you get there. It's [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3257.36s)]
*  just to get there. It's to have the medicine. And if AI can help with that, I don't see why we should [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3262.88s)]
*  treat it any differently than any other tool that we have brought into the toolkit over the past [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3267.6800000000003s)]
*  decades of pharma. Yeah. I want to double back real quick on something we were talking about [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3272.64s)]
*  earlier that I think relates to that skepticism and how are you doing on time, by the way, Hilary? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3277.68s)]
*  Oh, I'm fine. I'm doing fine. Good, because we could talk all afternoon. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3283.68s)]
*  I want to double back to the point you made about validation and the wet lab. I think we were [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3288.96s)]
*  talking about data and you were talking about like, you know, you cycle these outputs back to the [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3292.56s)]
*  wet lab and then that wet lab experience creates more data, perhaps negative, to get back to that [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3297.2s)]
*  negative data, I think perhaps negative, and you feed that positive and negative data back into the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3303.2s)]
*  machine, this iterative process. And I want to, one, make sure I'm correct here. ProFluent is [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3307.2799999999997s)]
*  conducting that wet lab work, correct? Yes, we are. So we have both the dry side of the lab, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3316.96s)]
*  which is more the machine learning AI side, and then we have a burgeoning wet lab so that we can [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3323.84s)]
*  carry out some of that initial validation ourselves. Yes. Yeah. So am I right also in [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3330.0s)]
*  assuming that the work that goes on in the wet lab, the outputs of that work get fed back in, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3336.7200000000003s)]
*  like I said, positive and negative data and therefore contribute to the learning, right? [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3342.96s)]
*  To the learning. They do. I mean, that's part of, I think, how it got the name generative AI, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3350.3199999999997s)]
*  because it's this idea of generations or iterations. So, you know, the model will [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3355.04s)]
*  generate and create these novel from scratch sequences. We go into the wet lab, we make them, [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3362.64s)]
*  we test them out, generate data, that data goes back into the model. It takes a look at what worked, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3368.56s)]
*  what didn't, and it then iterates on those parent sequences and creates child sequences that usually [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3373.92s)]
*  are better, right? Because it's learned valuable things. And that iteration process back and forth, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3383.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, most of the problems that we've worked on to date, we've needed about two to three cycles [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3388.96s)]
*  back and forth. And so it's just, it's incredibly fast to be able to get sort of that validation and [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3394.4s)]
*  then immediately have better options to try out. Yeah. All right. Now I'm going to fast forward [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3401.04s)]
*  again, bounce back to the skepticism thing. And I don't want to beat this horse. Like I don't want [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3406.48s)]
*  to overstate the skepticism thing. But from my perspective, I mean, I cover the space. I talk [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3410.72s)]
*  to a lot of folks and I see it all the time, but I'm curious about your perspective as a business [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3416.88s)]
*  development person. Like you're the business development person who's like out there engaging [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3421.12s)]
*  the industry with this solution set that ProFluent is working on. What are you seeing in terms of [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3425.84s)]
*  industry appetite? Yeah. So perhaps a couple of musings here. One is that I think we are seeing [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3432.6400000000003s)]
*  a trend where if you look back five, seven years, most of the talk around AI in pharma was more around [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3443.36s)]
*  better analysis of clinical trial data, patient data, or could it be used to streamline [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3452.96s)]
*  manufacturing processes, quality control, stuff like that. And what you're seeing more at JP Morgan [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3460.48s)]
*  and many other venues over the past 12 months has been, does AI have a place in earlier stage in [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3466.56s)]
*  discovery and development research? And a lot of examples that are proving out, yes, it fundamentally [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3474.48s)]
*  does across a wide array of verticals. I think some of the first comers were more in the antibody [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3479.68s)]
*  biologic space and then you see folks doing small molecule research with AI and then other [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3485.2799999999997s)]
*  types of proteins. And so I mean, it's here. And I think in terms of the industry appetite [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3490.72s)]
*  and adoption for it, that appetite's definitely there. From my perspective on the BD side of the [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3496.7999999999997s)]
*  startup, there's a distinct bifurcation between sort of like flavors of big drama. So on the one [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3505.28s)]
*  side, I see certain companies that have really invested enough to know AI and it's not always [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3512.4s)]
*  folks being like, I'm going to go get a second PhD in machine learning, but they bring in the [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3519.0400000000004s)]
*  right people to sort of augment their capabilities. And those are the folks who can do deep diligence, [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3523.84s)]
*  because nowadays there are hundreds of companies who plaster sort of AI, machine learning, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3531.52s)]
*  deep learning on their website. When you look under the hood, you get a sense of how cutting [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3536.96s)]
*  edge and innovative are they in the field of AI? When something's new and people don't know much [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3542.96s)]
*  about it, the glitz and the glam can be very easy to sort of hide things. But is a company using, [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3547.9199999999996s)]
*  say, somebody else's open source code and recycling it for their own purpose? Or have they made AI [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3554.48s)]
*  advancements in and of themselves? Do they have platform innovation on the side of AI, [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3561.04s)]
*  not just on the side of drug development? So that's kind of like you have that sort of flavor of big [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3565.92s)]
*  pharma that's made the investment, that understands it, and that knows where they want to apply it. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3573.92s)]
*  These are the folks that'll come to us saying, we have a problem. We have strategic alignment or [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3579.2799999999997s)]
*  focus on a particular indication. We see this particular mutation in this patient group's DNA, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3584.88s)]
*  and none of the tools that we're working with right now can efficiently address that mutation, [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3592.6400000000003s)]
*  fix that mutation. And we know that to address it, we need something with these exact criteria. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3598.96s)]
*  Can you build that for us? That's a conversation that's fun. Then perhaps the second bucket is more [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3605.04s)]
*  the folks that see that AI is sexy. They see that everybody's talking about it, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3613.2s)]
*  but they don't understand it. They have some fundamental skepticism or they want sort of a [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3619.12s)]
*  proof of concept, a look-see, a pilot. They want to test it out before they invest too heavily. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3625.4399999999996s)]
*  And often they don't know what they want to use it for. And our CEO Ali is fond of saying, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3630.64s)]
*  why bother using AI for problems that could be solved without AI? Reserve the big guns for [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3638.08s)]
*  the problems that are intricate and complicated enough that you can't solve them by yourself. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3644.56s)]
*  We don't want proof of concept experiments. We want big, meaty, ambitious moonshots, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3649.92s)]
*  because that's where you really test your technology out. That's where you figure out [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3656.08s)]
*  the difference between hype and reality. How do you sell that though? I mean, how do you... [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3660.7200000000003s)]
*  You're a BD person who... You're heading up BD for this company that, as I said, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3667.12s)]
*  is doing some things open source, giving some stuff away. You want these great big giant [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3672.48s)]
*  projects, these big problems to solve. How do you... I'm curious about... Give me a little hint as [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3678.64s)]
*  to what the business model looks like there right now. Yeah. So I think we are super early stage [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3685.84s)]
*  right now. I've been here for six months. And so I think ultimately strategy is always going to [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3691.84s)]
*  be a moving target that needs to evolve with the changing times and the changing markets. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3697.36s)]
*  I think we looked at the early stages of the company and said, what is our strength right now? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3702.0s)]
*  We're small, 25 people, roundabouts. What we know is protein design. What we have is some amazing [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3709.6800000000003s)]
*  machine learning scientists and some amazing editing scientists who really can make that [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3718.64s)]
*  feed forward loop go quickly. And so why not play to our strengths? And why not have a success [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  before you build too ambitiously? Why not... Ali's paper from back when he was at Salesforce [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3732.4s)]
*  in Nature Biotech showing the first example of somebody could take large language models [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3740.64s)]
*  and write proteins from scratch and then they worked, right? That was a moonshot in and of [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3745.76s)]
*  itself. And to go from the theoretical to the practice and then to start thinking of, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3751.1200000000003s)]
*  how are you going to apply this, right? Why not find partners who are the experts in that given [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3756.4s)]
*  field or that given disease, who understand what it takes to take something from that early [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3763.44s)]
*  discovery lead stage and turn it, get it to the clinic on sort of that accelerated timeline. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3769.44s)]
*  And we each play to our strengths, right? A lot of, this is maybe more in sort of like the [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3775.84s)]
*  biotech or the startup world, but I will say that often what happens is when you're fighting for [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3781.44s)]
*  VC money and fighting to stay alive in markets like this, one of the first things that often gets cut [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3787.36s)]
*  is your platform team. Because often by then you have a couple of programs in the clinic or heading [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3792.6400000000003s)]
*  to the clinic and you just can't just- Yeah, you can't justify keeping a platform team alive [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3797.5200000000004s)]
*  if all you're seeing is sort of, they're putting in tons of hard, amazing work, but they're getting [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3803.2s)]
*  kind of these incremental advances in proteins. And so in some ways that's what we are in a module [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3807.2799999999997s)]
*  is your protein design team from your wildest dreams, right? With capabilities that, again, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3814.7999999999997s)]
*  a lot of companies haven't necessarily invested in the AI infrastructure to be able to do protein [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3820.96s)]
*  design at the level that we can do it. And so as we've been, as we debuted, one of the reasons I [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3825.7599999999998s)]
*  think for open sourcing, open CRISPR was this idea of how do you prove that you have what it takes [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3832.24s)]
*  to live up to some of these promises, right? And to be able to show that for the first challenge [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3839.68s)]
*  that we took on publicly, right, wasn't necessarily a let's go find some small, easy enzyme family and [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3846.64s)]
*  then see if we can make a competitor to that. No, Ali looked for hard problems. I remember some of [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3853.52s)]
*  our earliest conversations and he said, tell me about editing, tell me about whitespace. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3859.6s)]
*  How easy is it to make an editing therapy, which got everybody laughing because it is so hard. [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3864.4s)]
*  Build something that is safe and efficacious for patients. And he said, okay, let's go. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3871.12s)]
*  Let's build something here that works. And so open CRISPR was not us trying to build a [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3876.56s)]
*  spy Cas9 competitor or some perfect editor for a given use case. It was literally a proof of [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3883.68s)]
*  concept of us saying we've trained up a model. We fine tuned that model. If we now let it run [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3891.2s)]
*  and tell it to make something similar to Cas9, but with a completely dissimilar sequence, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3897.68s)]
*  can it do that and do those sequences function? Cutting DNA is not an easy task. And going through [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3903.7599999999998s)]
*  that project and coming out with some top hits that had amazing activity, that was absolutely [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3913.52s)]
*  phenomenal. And so open CRISPR itself, that's just one sequence out of millions in our portfolio. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3919.84s)]
*  So in terms of business value, the inherent value around one sequence, it's not quite the same. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3927.28s)]
*  I think if you look back at the earlier days, there's a lot of focus on static assets, on, [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3933.6s)]
*  well, I own this molecule. I own this sequence. And I will license it to other people who want [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3942.32s)]
*  to make medicines using that molecule. I think we're maybe moving a little bit beyond that [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3948.0s)]
*  to less of what the sequence is, but more of, can I build the best thing that will fix this problem? [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3953.44s)]
*  And there are maybe hundreds of ways I could go about building different things to fix that [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3962.32s)]
*  problem. And so then it becomes a little bit more around those ambitious problems and the products [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3967.84s)]
*  that you're helping somebody design and build and test. And so we just ultimately made the decision [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3974.0s)]
*  that what we would like open CRISPR to achieve is accelerating innovation. There are a lot of folks [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3980.0s)]
*  out there who are very interested in solving problems with CRISPR technology, but for a variety [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3988.56s)]
*  of reasons, maybe they're a little intimidated by the intellectual property landscape. Maybe they [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3994.88s)]
*  can't afford the royalties. They're looking for other options. And so you don't see open [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=3999.76s)]
*  sourcing really happen in the world of biotech. It's very common in tech, right? Where it's like, [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4007.52s)]
*  new software, I'm going to just give you my raw source code and you're going to break it and you're [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4012.32s)]
*  going to make it better. And the whole idea behind that is to advance the pace of innovation. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4016.88s)]
*  Right? And so we started wondering similarly, I thought it was a crazy idea at first, [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4023.68s)]
*  I'm not going to lie. It's grown on me. This idea of that was never going to be per se our money [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4028.0s)]
*  maker. There are tons of enzymes out there that are simple cutters, that are nucleases. And so why [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4035.68s)]
*  not just give this one out to the community and say, use it for whatever you want. Use it for [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4040.48s)]
*  research. Use it to build a therapeutic. You don't owe us a cent. Just go and make good things with [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4044.56s)]
*  it. And what was fascinating to me is I kind of thought, what kind of demand are we going to see? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4050.56s)]
*  What kind of interests are we going to see? And from a business development perspective, [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4055.92s)]
*  I think when I look at the past for given sequences, depending on your licensing paradigm, [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4060.72s)]
*  exclusive, non-exclusive, maybe you see four or five players bidding on something. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4066.72s)]
*  We got hundreds of license requests in the first week, which we were totally unprepared to deal [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4073.52s)]
*  with, frankly, right? That type of demand we just hadn't anticipated. And from such diverse sources, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4080.72s)]
*  folks in agriculture, folks in bio manufacturing, folks in therapeutics, big pharma, academia, [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4087.3599999999997s)]
*  small startups, right? And it sparked a lot of really interesting conversations that led beyond [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4092.3999999999996s)]
*  open CRISPR and more to, okay, if this is the proof of concept of what your models can build, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4098.64s)]
*  now build me this other thing that will solve this other problem I have. And so, stay tuned. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4104.400000000001s)]
*  I think you're going to see some interesting things from ProFluent in the next year. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4109.52s)]
*  Scott Fertig It sounds like it. And the [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4112.320000000001s)]
*  equation, the recipe, like what you're putting together there, new as it may be and agile as [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4120.0s)]
*  the company may be, right? The direction is not necessarily carved out in stone, but you're doing [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4126.0s)]
*  well. I mean, you've attracted some pretty significant investor dollars. I mean, I think [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4131.92s)]
*  I read somewhere like 44 million. Yes, we have 44 million in funding. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4137.36s)]
*  Yeah. So, I mean, you're in good shape there. And we're going to stay tuned. And I would love [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4142.32s)]
*  to continue talking to you all afternoon. We do need to wrap it up, though. We're going way long. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4149.52s)]
*  But we'll do a part two. How's that? You know, we'll get back together. There's so much more to [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4154.400000000001s)]
*  talk about. But I want to wrap things up a little bit with like, you know, maybe we can't get too [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4159.2s)]
*  crystal clear on what's happening next with ProFluent. But you said from the outset of this [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4166.08s)]
*  conversation, I remember you told me when we first spoke a couple weeks ago, because I remember [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4171.68s)]
*  responding to you. You said, you know, I didn't know what I wanted to be when I grew up. And I [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4176.08s)]
*  think I responded to you and said, I'm 49 years old and I still don't know what I want to be when [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4180.88s)]
*  I grow up. A lot of people are hoping that I don't choose to be a podcast host. But you've been [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4184.24s)]
*  studying, like we talked about it, like you got into the gene editing space, you stayed in that [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4190.400000000001s)]
*  therapeutic area for a while and then obviously made this move to ProFluent, which is a bit of a [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4194.16s)]
*  departure. But I'm just curious, like, what sort of has driven, you know, beyond the things that [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4199.6s)]
*  we talked about, what have some of the drivers been that have led you to the point where [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4207.28s)]
*  you are now and what do you see coming down the pike? Like, what's the next sort of pivot for? [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4213.44s)]
*  I mean, I wish I knew. I think, you know, it's definitely fair to say that I am not the kind [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4221.12s)]
*  of person who has a five-year plan. That being said, in retrospect, I think I can pull certain [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4227.92s)]
*  patterns from some of my pivots and moves. And I think, you know, one of them is definitely [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4234.64s)]
*  the technology that I'm attracted to sort of disruptive, new, risky technology, because I [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4241.92s)]
*  think that that's ultimately where we're going to see some of the biggest payoffs. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4248.240000000001s)]
*  And it's just so closely connected to my mission of seeing other patients with rare disease get [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4253.12s)]
*  solutions. But even more so than the science, because again, I mean, around, you know, around [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4259.84s)]
*  the Bay Area, around Cambridge and Boston, you spit and you can find good science, right? There's [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4268.8s)]
*  a lot of good science, a lot of good technologies. I think the other major factor has always been the [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4273.68s)]
*  people. That you think, you know, in some ways, more of your life, more of the hours in your day [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4279.04s)]
*  to interacting with other people at your workplace than you might do with some of your families some [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4286.96s)]
*  of the time. And you want those to be good people that you want to be in a room at 2 a.m. in the [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4292.0s)]
*  morning, trying to figure out that next step in drug development or get that deal done. That's [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4298.24s)]
*  going to lead to the progression of a program. And that has been a constant theme. I have made, [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4302.4s)]
*  you know, you don't have to be best friends with everybody that you work with, but I have made some [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4309.599999999999s)]
*  lifelong friends at Editas, at VOR, at Tome and now at Profluent. And that is going to think, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4313.36s)]
*  I think, be a continuing theme, working with other like minded people who are hardworking, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4319.679999999999s)]
*  who are intelligent and competent and who are just decent human beings that are in it, not for the [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4326.0s)]
*  glory, not for the VC dollars, not for the potential ROI, but really, really just want to help people. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4332.0s)]
*  And this is the way that they've chosen. And I would imagine that that's going to be where I [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4339.68s)]
*  continue to center interest around opportunities. And, you know, at some point I might decide to [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4343.84s)]
*  take the plunge and kind of go full force into patient advocacy. Time will sort of tell, like, [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4350.0s)]
*  I can't wait. You know, I think I should do one of those like message in a bottle to myself. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4356.0s)]
*  Like, you know, if it had been 10 years ago, I never would have said this is where I would be [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4360.08s)]
*  sitting. And yet here I am enjoying every second of it. Right. So like, I just I can't wait to see [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4364.64s)]
*  what the next 10 years bring. Well, you'll be continuing to do the Venn diagram exercise [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4369.28s)]
*  as part of sort of the yeah, your enthusiasm and excitement, you know, and knowledge is it's, [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4375.92s)]
*  it makes it very clear, right? Like that you're in the right place right now. And I'm, [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4385.599999999999s)]
*  I've learned a lot in this conversation. And I'm glad that you came on to spend some time with you. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4390.88s)]
*  And I am also disappointed because I would like to spend the next two hours continuing the [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4396.64s)]
*  conversation, but I just can't can't do that. So anytime. Yeah, we'll definitely do it again. But [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4402.240000000001s)]
*  I hope you've enjoyed it as well. And I'll be in touch to get around to scheduled. Sounds good. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUqFckWvDGI&t=4408.0s)]
