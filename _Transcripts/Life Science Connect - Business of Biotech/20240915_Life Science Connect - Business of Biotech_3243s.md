Video Description: SR One Capital Management CEO Simeon George, M.D. has a seemingly innate ability to pick winning biotech builders. Early on, he and his firm got behind CRISPR's Samarth Kulkarni, Ph.D., Arcellx' Rami Elghandour, and Nkarta's Paul Hastings, for example. With nearly 50 biotech leaders in SR One's portfolio, there are plenty more where those three came from. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Dr. George, admits that despite his gifted brain he more readily follows his heart. Still, over the course of our conversation, he shares insight into the decision making processes that have contributed to his success at picking winners as an investment banker and biotech venture capitalist.

# Picking Biotech Jockeys With SR One's Simeon George, M.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw)
*  Anyone who's been paying attention to the business of biotech knows that we don't often host venture capital leaders on this show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=0.0s)]
*  My guest's chair is typically reserved for people in the throes of building biopharmaceutical companies. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=11.0s)]
*  But when you have the opportunity to interview a guy with a Johns Hopkins BA, a Penn MD, and a Wharton MBA, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=18.0s)]
*  the same guy who co-founded successful biotechs like Arcelics and Encarta prior to launching his capital management practice, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=27.0s)]
*  and whose capital management practice played the lead role in the launch of CRISPR therapeutics, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=35.0s)]
*  and a guy who's simply a fantastic human being and a joy to talk with, you make an exception. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=41.0s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=47.0s)]
*  And if you haven't placed them already, my guest on today's show is SR1 Capital Management CEO and managing partner, Dr. Simeon George. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=50.0s)]
*  Simeon, welcome to the show. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=60.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you for having me. It's great to be on this platform with you, podcast with you, and look forward to today's conversation. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=62.0s)]
*  As do I. Yeah, I really appreciate you coming on. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=70.0s)]
*  And, you know, as I mentioned from the outset of the conversation here in my opening sort of prologue, you're an MD. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=72.0s)]
*  And typically, the MDs that I have on this program, I'm going to say almost all of them, if not all of them, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=80.0s)]
*  have spent a considerable amount of time early in their career either practicing or working in academia [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=86.0s)]
*  or perhaps working in research at a large hospital or research university prior to even thinking about or entertaining the idea of jumping into the business side of biotech, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=94.0s)]
*  becoming a member of industry, working for a biopharmaceutical company, or, you know, God forbid, jumping right in and launching new biotech companies. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=106.0s)]
*  You look to be, at least on paper, quite different. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=115.0s)]
*  It looks like you kind of made that decision very early on in your career. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=119.0s)]
*  So I want to start there. I'm just curious around sort of what your intentions were at the time [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=124.0s)]
*  and what your frame of mind was when you came out of your MD studies and said, all right, what do I do next? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=128.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, thank you. It's a great question. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=135.0s)]
*  And I would say for me, the majority of the most important decisions that I've made in my life have been driven more by heart and intuition and gut, if you will, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=138.0s)]
*  rather than analyzing and sort of taking a more calculated way to decide what to do. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=147.0s)]
*  And so, you know, my from the youngest from my earliest memories through to today, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=153.0s)]
*  what I've been drawn to and most passionate about is sort of being at an intersection between life sciences and problem solving and doing things that seem impossible, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=159.0s)]
*  whether it's in the case of taking care of patients and trying to get them through some of the most challenging moments in their lives or doing it, frankly, at scale, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=169.0s)]
*  which I think the work that I do now in the industry that we're so grateful to be able to work in allows us to have access to is the ability to have an impact across hundreds, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=178.0s)]
*  thousands of patients, their loved ones, the ecosystem, that society beyond that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=188.0s)]
*  And so when I was making the initial decision, that was sort of the true north that I was gravitating towards. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=193.0s)]
*  And I would also say having benefited from the dual degree at Penn and having spent time between my clinical rotations and the business world, you know, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=201.0s)]
*  where I spent time in investment banking at Goldman, consulting at Bain, as well as SR1, where I actually did an internship. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=210.0s)]
*  I at least have some level of informed sense of which direction really resonated with my heart and with my main tuition and gut. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=217.0s)]
*  And so those were the two principal drivers behind which I took the leap, not knowing, frankly, how things might play out over the medium to long term, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=227.0s)]
*  but just believing the short term, this would be a great place to continue to build a skill set experience network and continue to follow my my intuition around where to go next. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=236.0s)]
*  It's interesting you should say that. I mean, it's curious to me, like, you know, you're so well trained, right, and well trained on data and facts and what we know about, you know, human biology and medicine. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=246.0s)]
*  And yet you let your gut and intuition guide such such major decisions. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=262.0s)]
*  Where do you think that comes from? Like, where do you think what influences Simeon George to follow his his heart rather than his very well trained and talented mind? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=268.0s)]
*  Yeah, not that you don't follow that as well. I don't mean to discredit that, but you know what I'm you know what I mean? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=279.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's really funny. I mean, again, Matt, without I'm sure we might get into this, but if I think back to my role as an investor over the last 10, 15 years, I can tell you in pretty much every instance, like it's been within the first few minutes of meeting a founder entrepreneur. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=285.0s)]
*  I've known that I wanted to invest in this company. I've done the work to your point. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=301.0s)]
*  Like, it's not like I'm not rigorous on the analysis or that my team and I aren't spending time on all the details, but that initial intuition has always been for me just incredible. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=306.0s)]
*  I think strength of mine and, you know, I'm not sure if it's God given or if I've developed it over time. I do think my own sort of background, you know, I moved around a lot as a child, different schools, different school systems between the UK, US. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=317.0s)]
*  I've always been in uncomfortable situations, I'd say, and I've relied on an initial like self belief, self confidence and an ability to make decisions in rapid fire to put me into situations that are more comfortable or that I can I can manage. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=334.0s)]
*  And so that is the way I approach the work that I do. And if I'm honest, I feel more at home in those situations where it is uncertain, like there is no black or white decision and you have to have a level of belief, you know, trust but verify like you have an initial instinct or or sort of direction and you do some validating work. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=351.0s)]
*  And then you go back to that belief and sort of decide then what to do. So that's that has been, I'd say foundational to my life experience. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=372.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. I believe the first time we spoke, you told me that you grew up in the UK, correct? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=380.0s)]
*  That's correct. Yeah. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=387.0s)]
*  Yeah. And you came over here for college. And I think I asked you how it's possible that you don't have an accent. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=388.0s)]
*  I know it's still I mean, my friends and family still don't understand how I managed to end up with this American accent. But I am I mean, I think there's no great answer. I wish I still had it. I think I did have it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=396.0s)]
*  I'm pretty confident my parents will say I did have it. And then I actually moved into the American school system when I was in middle school. So I went to the American school, London. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=411.0s)]
*  And so had that sort of formative period where I was transitioning into the U.S. system. And I probably subliminally or unconsciously tried to lean into fitting in when developing an American accent. So that might be part of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=420.0s)]
*  I wish I could get that, though, Matt. I will tell you, it probably helps me would help me more with that accent now than is the case. But that's that's where we are. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=435.0s)]
*  Can't just call it up. No, I want to hear as our ones origin story because it's unique as well. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=443.0s)]
*  It's also a little bit about its foundations at GSK and how it came to be a standalone entity. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah, so that's right. So as our one capital management, the firm that I work in now that I lead is less than four years old. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=457.0s)]
*  You know, it's an independent investment firm that was spun out of GSK, GlaxoSmithKline, one of the largest multinational pharmaceutical companies in the fall of 2020. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=464.0s)]
*  And prior to that, SR1 was the venture arm of GSK. It was a corporate entity that invested in biotech. And to give you some sense, it started investing in biotech in the mid 1980s when the field was certainly emerging and there was, you know, SmithKline at the time had capital on their balance sheets. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=475.0s)]
*  And there was this new field and they thought, let's let's create a vehicle that can give us some exposure to that and to their credit and to the credit of the organization as it evolved with mergers and leadership changes. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=494.0s)]
*  The mission of that fund was really to be a financial vehicle, first and foremost, investing in this new field, emerging field of biotech that everyone appreciated would have an impact on the the pharma ecosystem and to provide a strategic lift to that [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=506.0s)]
*  organization, the R&D, business development organization. But it was always set up with the financial sort of mindset in terms of how we thought about investing and returning capital. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=523.0s)]
*  And so it was really that approach when I joined, you know, in the late 2000s through to 2020 when we spun out that we used to build a really meaningful network, invest in some really high quality companies, [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=535.0s)]
*  develop a track record, sort of do all of the capabilities of an independent fund, but doing it with one investor, which was GSK. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=551.0s)]
*  And then we transitioned out, created a new fund, raised fresh pools of capital, have a broad set of investors, including GSK now, but are essentially on that same mission and journey of investing in biotech, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=559.0s)]
*  identifying and nurturing the next crop of hopefully, you know, generational startups, like companies that have an ambition to really transform the life sciences ecosystem. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=572.0s)]
*  Yeah. What was your role when SR1 was still a GSK entity? What was your role? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=584.0s)]
*  I guess kind of walk me through how your role there developed to the point where when it did spin out, you were you were tapped on the shoulder to lead it. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=591.0s)]
*  Yeah, so was it a hostile takeover on Simeon George's part? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=600.0s)]
*  No, no, this is done in a very collaborative way. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=605.0s)]
*  You can hopefully ask folks on my team or outside and they might corroborate that. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=609.0s)]
*  So again, you know, so I joined as an associate, so entry level position into an investment firm, which was SR1. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=614.0s)]
*  And the first phase was really learning the trade, the craft of investing in biotech. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=621.0s)]
*  So meeting with companies, doing the diligence, supporting senior members of the team. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=627.0s)]
*  And that period, again, for folks who are listening, you know, was formative because it was post global financial crisis. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=632.0s)]
*  So, you know, 08, 09, 10, where, you know, the public markets frankly didn't really exist. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=640.0s)]
*  Capital was constrained and it was challenging for any company to really take shape and develop and do all the things that, you know, frankly, we take for granted a little bit today, I think. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=646.0s)]
*  So I learned those formative sort of challenges and experiences during that first phase. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=657.0s)]
*  And then I shifted into a more senior role. I moved to the Bay Area. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=664.0s)]
*  I'd been in Philadelphia for the first part of my career with SR1. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=668.0s)]
*  I moved to the Bay Area and really to be the, you know, the front face of SR1 in this vibrant ecosystem that is, you know, West Coast biotech, Bay Area biotech. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=672.0s)]
*  And really spent that period of time really trying to build a strong network of founders, entrepreneurs, investors and managed to invest in some really high quality companies and learned from those entrepreneurs, those founders, those syndicates. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=684.0s)]
*  Again, we're going to get into like the business of biotech. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=699.0s)]
*  Like, what does it take to really create value in our ecosystem? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=701.0s)]
*  And again, sort of coming out of that global financial crisis, there were starting to be some thawing around the ecosystem, around the capital markets. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=704.0s)]
*  And so I got to experience that through some of those early companies that we invested in. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=713.0s)]
*  And the third phase was really what I would describe as the beginning of my entrepreneurial journey. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=720.0s)]
*  I had gotten the itch to get closer to actually starting companies and that led to investments, I should say, starting companies. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=725.0s)]
*  And you mentioned in the beginning, Arcelics and Encarta were really two companies that started from a blank sheet of paper, really a labor of love for myself and my co-founder Ali Bebohani, who's at NEA. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=733.0s)]
*  And we pull those together with some incredible scientific founders, Dario Campania in the case of Encarta and David Hilbert in the case of Arcelics and launched those companies. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=745.0s)]
*  But for that period, I got to live and breathe the experience of being a startup entrepreneur and convincing first myself, then my team at SR1, then other investors and entrepreneurs and scientists to join these startups. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=755.0s)]
*  And so, again, just an amazing experience at that point in time. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=770.0s)]
*  And during that same period invested in CRISPR when it was also really just a fledgling startup with, you know, I joke, like two guys in a garage with some questionable IP. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=774.0s)]
*  And so got to sort of ride that amazing experience and wave through to today, which has been just an enormous privilege for me. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=784.0s)]
*  And then the last phase, I guess the phase now that I'm in is continuing that entrepreneurial journey. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=793.0s)]
*  But as you pointed out, working with GSK and external investors to figure out a way to create a new fund spinning out from the large organization, setting up essentially a startup, focusing on some core principles around which I've just described. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=799.0s)]
*  But then really thinking now with an ambition of how do we take it to the next level and how do we continue to create a firm that is truly going to be elite? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=815.0s)]
*  And so I've been running the firm now four years as we've been an independent firm, but had been running SR1 during the last couple of years prior to the spin out. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=825.0s)]
*  So I've had sort of the full transition and experience in this leadership role now. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=836.0s)]
*  Yeah, your experiences in OA like during that downtime in the economy since then, I mean, from OA to 24, you know, we've seen it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=841.0s)]
*  I guess you describe it as a roller coaster. We've seen a lot of big ups and a lot of big downs again. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=854.0s)]
*  How did that, I guess, that experience in OA, which was among your, you know, among your first experiences in the space, how did it sort of influence your style and your mindset when times are good? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=861.0s)]
*  How did it influence like how you steady the course, regardless of whether markets are going ballistic and funding everything and every one or being incredibly discerning and not funding much? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=876.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I try as best I can to hearken back to those experience because they were both formative, but they're also learnings that you can apply at any point in time. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=891.0s)]
*  And I think the more I can sort of have that mindset around lean means sort of fundamental driven, the better off I will be as an investor. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=903.0s)]
*  And hopefully our companies can benefit from that. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=912.0s)]
*  So I'd say the first thing I really think about this at sort of a just a startup level, like ultimately, whether it's biotech or high tech or crypto or AI, whatever it is like, you know, the job of a startup is to run a business that can create value and have a clear value proposition. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=915.0s)]
*  And as efficiently as it can validate that that value proposition, create a product that fits with what the market needs are. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=932.0s)]
*  And in our space, we're so blessed to have an ability to work in an area where ultimately it's a medicine that touches a patient that shows that the drug is working, has a true clinical impact. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=941.0s)]
*  And that is ultimately the only principle in our business that goes across market cycles, where inflation is, whether we're living through a global pandemic, whatever is happening in the world. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=952.0s)]
*  If you can actually work in a manner that is focused on where is the medicine, how does this benefit patients? [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=964.0s)]
*  There is value to be created. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=971.0s)]
*  And so I try and stay as focused on that anchoring philosophy. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=973.0s)]
*  That's point number one. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=978.0s)]
*  And point number two, it's really, you know, being on an entrepreneurial or founder journey with the team there to try and help them as best we can put out every fire that's coming and being thrown their way, whether it's around capital raising, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=979.0s)]
*  hiring, pharma partnering, again, whatever's happening on the macro that's impacted SVB blowing up, whatever it is, like being a thought partner, being someone that's there to counsel, to advise, to support and sort of the blocking and tackling all the way through to the more strategic elements. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=994.0s)]
*  It's really staying consistent with this mindset of we are in service of the founders and entrepreneurs and the startups that we're backing, with the assumption being that they're on this journey of science to medicine. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1011.0s)]
*  So those are the things that I try and keep in my mind. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1022.0s)]
*  And I find when I do that, everything else becomes noise or things that you can then calibrate how you want to deal with the particular issue. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1026.0s)]
*  Yeah, those external forces. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1035.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1037.0s)]
*  So I want to break down some of the some of the ground that you just covered. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1038.0s)]
*  And I want to start. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1042.0s)]
*  I want to start with you mentioned where where is the medicine? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1043.0s)]
*  And what's the what's the patient impact like to to central tenets of the mission? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1048.0s)]
*  So what's your what's your opinion on that? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1054.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, where is the medicine? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1056.0s)]
*  Since you got into this business, that question, the answer to that question has probably changed. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1058.0s)]
*  You've seen trends, you know, where is it today? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1063.0s)]
*  And if you want, you know, maybe even share some of the some of the trend line that you've seen since you since you started founding and funding biotechs. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1066.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1075.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, the truth is now I feel like we have relative to even when I started more tools in our armamentarium than we've ever had. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1076.0s)]
*  And when I talk about tools and I'm I'm talking principally about the different modalities, technologies from small molecule through to advanced therapies, platform technologies. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1084.0s)]
*  You know, we talked about CRISPR, there's RNA, all the different ways you can modulate. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1095.0s)]
*  So we have this amazing suite of capabilities and there's still challenges there. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1099.0s)]
*  And some of them are frankly meaningful bottlenecks. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1104.0s)]
*  So manufacturing sort of the cost of, you know, supplying and manufacturing at scale a product, significant bottleneck. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1106.0s)]
*  And so we've got point solutions around off the shelf as one example of ways that people can solve it. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1114.0s)]
*  There's delivery challenges, which, again, can limit where a therapy can reach most effectively. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1120.0s)]
*  And, you know, liver is where, again, a lot of these advanced therapies end up. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1126.0s)]
*  And so how do you get the medicine to different parts of the body? [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1129.0s)]
*  But, you know, if you take a step back, there's more tools than we know what to do with. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1134.0s)]
*  So it is actually in some ways a blessing and a curse, because what it means is the startups and investors such as ourselves have to be really, I'd say, vigilant and prudent to guard against falling in love with the technology, but rather focusing on again, why is this particular if it's a platform or a product? [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1138.0s)]
*  If it's a platform or, you know, technology, why is it the right approach to go after a disease setting, whether it's the target you're talking about, the patient population? [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1158.0s)]
*  You know, what is again going back to product market fit? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1168.0s)]
*  I think that needs to be as refined as you can make it as early in the journey as you can make it. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1171.0s)]
*  And that that is something that we have certainly been guilty of waiting too long in some instances. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1178.0s)]
*  As a result, you probably spend more time because you're in love with the technology and you're tinkering with it and you're optimizing in a way that practically doesn't help with that first key principle that I talked about. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1184.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I think where we are today, we've got amazing suite of technologies. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1195.0s)]
*  We still have significant unmet need head to toe disease area across disease area. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1199.0s)]
*  And we really are at the tip of the spear in terms of what we're able to see and show now. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1206.0s)]
*  And so, again, using the CRISPR example, we have one approved medicine for sickle cell and beta thalassemia, Casgev, which again, incredibly proud of the CRISPR team and the Vertex partnership. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1212.0s)]
*  And now hopefully we're going to treat a cure patients. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1225.0s)]
*  But, you know, Matt, there are hundreds, if not thousands of diseases where we hope to use gene medicines now, right, to be able to treat correct cure. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1228.0s)]
*  And so the onus now is on CRISPR and all the startups that are using these techniques to go and prosecute against the biology that makes the most sense with the tools that they have. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1238.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1250.0s)]
*  Looking at the portfolio and the companies we've been talking about, you know, obviously we've been talking about cell and gene therapy companies a little bit here just in reference to some of the companies that you've been involved with. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1252.0s)]
*  Do you have sort of a deference towards the cell and gene space, ATMPs, or would you characterize SR1 as more agnostic in terms of the modalities it's most interested in? [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1264.0s)]
*  I'd say it's fairly agnostic. I haven't looked at the most recent numbers. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1275.0s)]
*  We've done, I think, about 10 deals this year between seed startup all the way through late stage, private and public. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1280.0s)]
*  And just skimming through them in my mind now, it's a mix. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1287.0s)]
*  Like we've got small molecules, we've got biologics, advanced therapy. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1290.0s)]
*  So it's again, there is no one size fits all. We look at it on a case by case basis. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1294.0s)]
*  We certainly have deep expertise in these advanced areas to be able to call on and leverage as we are reviewing and underwriting a particular opportunity. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1299.0s)]
*  But we will look at any approach that an entrepreneur or founder startup is working on. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1308.0s)]
*  Yeah. What about, I want to ask sort of the same question, but from an indication standpoint, it's easy for people who have mission driven philosophies to latch onto or marry to a specific indication or related sets of indications. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1315.0s)]
*  And when your goal is to make a broad patient impact generally, like from the physician's perspective, broaden that patient impact, there's a huge continuum there. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1333.0s)]
*  Like you can make a giant impact on people who suffer from a terrible and debilitating and perhaps deadly rare disease, but it's a limited number of patients, huge impact, limited number. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1343.0s)]
*  Or, you know, you can tackle any number of indications in oncology where you can have an impact on millions of patients. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1357.0s)]
*  Do you have any any any preference there in terms of your own kind of yeah, your own kind of direction? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1364.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this goes a little bit to the inner workings of SR1. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1372.0s)]
*  And I do think this is one of, in my opinion, one of our differentiating features is we spend a ton of time on what we call organizational health and design and how we operate as a team. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1376.0s)]
*  And it's a balancing act between sort of having this collaboration teamwork orientation with an individual approach that allows folks on my team, including myself, to express ourselves and to follow the things that we're most excited about. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1386.0s)]
*  And so the way that we square that, if you will, is we use what's called the prepared mind approach, which is each person on the team basically has the ability to focus in on certain disease areas, modalities, whether it's rare, niche, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1400.0s)]
*  indication, or indication all the way through cardiovascular metabolic. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1415.0s)]
*  And we have almost like majors and minors. And so people through their own choosing lean into areas that they're most excited about. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1419.0s)]
*  They follow the science. They build the networks. They meet with companies, founders. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1427.0s)]
*  They have a sense of where pharma is. And so across the tapestry of SR1, you end up with, you know, without too much over engineering, essentially most of the key disease areas covered, modalities covered. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1431.0s)]
*  And so we have within our own rubric a way to be able to efficiently, I'd say, identify, prepare or react to what's coming at us. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1444.0s)]
*  And it is I really do lean on the team to follow what gets them excited, what gets them out of bed rather than being prescriptive and saying we're only doing this or we're doing that. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1454.0s)]
*  And that it's not only for disease area, but also for stage, you know, because we are a firm that invests across multi stages. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1464.0s)]
*  It also is a way for us to say we are really looking for the best, best in class from startups all the way through late stage. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1474.0s)]
*  And we want people on the team to be able to spend time in the various areas, share knowledge. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1481.0s)]
*  So that is also helpful for us to be able to take what we're seeing in the late stage and apply it to early stage and see again differentiation competition, things that again can be really helpful how that that might adopt it. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1487.0s)]
*  So I think hopefully that answers your question. You know, we there is no one size fits all within SR1. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1500.0s)]
*  I really want the team to feel empowered to go after the stuff areas that they're most excited about. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1505.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it definitely does. But it begs a question about the team. So I want to talk about people for a minute. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1511.0s)]
*  The team at SR1, beginning with the team at SR1, what does that team look like? [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1519.0s)]
*  Like, what is it comprised of in terms of expertise and what people are doing? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1523.0s)]
*  And so it's a multi-part question. I want to get a good illustration of what the team at SR1 looks like and what they're doing. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1529.0s)]
*  And then I want to I want to I want you to reflect a little bit on how your the gut and intuition leadership style that you expressed earlier in a conversation applies to building that team out. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1536.0s)]
*  Yeah, good question. So I think about our work as being principally in three categories. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1550.0s)]
*  There's the sourcing piece, which I think we just talked about in terms of how, you know, between prepared mind and allowing folks to go after areas of interest that I'd say largely covers sourcing. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1557.0s)]
*  And there is an investment team that's comprised of an investment committee. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1568.0s)]
*  And we'll get into the committee in a second. Four members, including myself, a set of investment professionals. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1573.0s)]
*  There's five members on the investment professional side. And these are, again, extremely talented, generally technically, you know, technically trained or years of experience in industry that are working closely with the investment committee. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1579.0s)]
*  So roughly 10 of the investing team. And then we have another five or six what we call venture partners that are there across different capacities, whether it's the sourcing piece. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1592.0s)]
*  The second category after sourcing is selecting. And so there's this piece around how do we ultimately hone in on which of the deals that we want to do. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1604.0s)]
*  And this is where I think your question around, again, trust, but verify. How do you rely on your intuition, validate it or invalidated based on the work that you do and then come back to your gut. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1612.0s)]
*  But that's where that selecting piece becomes critical. And so we have on a weekly basis at least two meetings with the team where we are reviewing deals, getting updates from sub teams on the work that they're doing and having, frankly, fairly open conversations, which the mindset really there is best ideas win. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1625.0s)]
*  Like no one knows what the truth is. And so if you're well, you know, you have prior knowledge, you're prepared, you've done the work on the particular deal, you have as much data, you're convinced you come in and you have a dialogue with myself and other members of the team. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1645.0s)]
*  And we genuinely are there to support the best ideas that might come from these these sorts of interactions. So that's the selecting piece. It has a mix of art and science to it, which I think is important. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1661.0s)]
*  And then the last piece is summiting. So there's sourcing, selecting and summiting and summiting is the area where all the work that goes in post investment. So it's like you're married to the startup. Now, how do you make sure that that marriage is as successful as it can be? And it reaches whatever the goals and aspirations are for that, for that enterprise. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1675.0s)]
*  And so, again, between the investing team and these venture partners who are incredibly talented operators who've been in roles in startups where they've been successful at building and scaling businesses, we bring all of those capabilities to bear in a way that is hopefully, again, of service to the entrepreneur and the founder. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1695.0s)]
*  It's not forced on them. It really is genuine interaction that is collaborative. And we have found it to a T to accompany to be something that has been incredibly well received by the entrepreneurs and the startup. So those are the three areas that we focus on. And that's the way the team is organized. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1713.0s)]
*  Align on those principles. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1732.0s)]
*  Your face lit up a little bit when you got to the summoning part. Is that is that your favorite part? [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1735.0s)]
*  I mean, again, going back back to the point on the problem solving, I like to work on hard things like I like to work on things where you don't know how to you don't know how you're going to do it. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1740.0s)]
*  You don't know how to do it. And so it requires you to bring everything that you have. It requires hard work. You have to get lucky. Like I think we have to acknowledge is an incredible amount of luck involved. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1750.0s)]
*  Certainly in my career, I've seen that and been the benefit. You know, I've benefited from that. But it's like putting yourselves in these incredibly hard positions and then figuring out what are all the ways through blood, sweat and tears and resilience that you can work through it. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1762.0s)]
*  And that, for me, has been the most inspiring part of my career, whether it's with the portfolio companies or frankly with the journey of SR one and where we've reached. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1776.0s)]
*  Yeah. OK, so maintaining the people track, I want to say in the people track, but I want to kind of transition to the people behind the companies that that are SR one gets involved with. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1785.0s)]
*  And and prior to that, the companies that you personally got involved with. And I think of an example, I think we talked about the fact that I had Rami Elgandor on my show a few weeks ago. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1796.0s)]
*  He was a guest on the business of biotech. He's the CEO at Arcelics, and he's a good friend of yours. And I imagine that when you have the opportunity to work with him on Arcelics, you're like you were leaning into that gut and intuition thing that you talked about. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1809.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I can totally see it. Fantastic man. You're like, I got I got to get this guy. I got to get this guy. I got to I got to work with this guy. To great effect, by the way, the company's killing it. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1827.0s)]
*  How do you when you got the you know, the sourcing piece that you mentioned in the selection piece that you mentioned, how do you transfer that sussing out, you know, that assessment of jockeys to the teams that are engaging your potential portfolio companies early on? [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1837.0s)]
*  How do you how do you transfer like the you know, the Simeon George intuition to the team? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1857.0s)]
*  To your friend to my team in terms of how we're evaluating company to your team, right? Right. And this is the train. This is the transition to the people, you know, the job that are leading the companies that you're bringing on board, right? Like, yeah. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1865.0s)]
*  You know, you, you want to bring quality people on the quality leaders of the companies you're investing in on and you can you can you can you can source and you can evaluate on science and data all day long. And then you know, then then you get a bad vibe from the from the guy or gal who's running the company. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1877.0s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if I want this one on the team, you know, but you're not necessarily interfacing with every single one of those potentials early on. So I'm just curious how you transfer, you know, some of that intuition and and soft skill to to the folks who are engaging early. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1896.0s)]
*  Yeah, and Matt, I want to acknowledge, I mean, again, there's no one size fits all. There might be investors out there that just focus on the fundamentals and the people piece. Certainly, maybe for later stage public investors, like they don't focus on this. For me, for how SR one is built, how we operate. It is core. Like it is genuinely core to our ethos. And I do think number one, there is a self selection process that has happened with the way my team has been constructed. I think people have built a lot of things that are going to be a part of the process. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1911.0s)]
*  And I think that's what brought into this philosophy of the power of just the human element of our business to be able to elevate at sometimes levitate the startups that they're involved in. Right. So I think that is a natural part of the ethos here. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1941.0s)]
*  And because we talk about this so much, because we have numerous interactions on a regular basis with entrepreneurs as a team, whether it's new teams that we're evaluating or just inviting our own entrepreneurs in to talk about what they're working on. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1957.0s)]
*  My strong belief is that there is enough of a pattern around which members of my team are applying what they're seeing through those interactions to what they're seeing, as you say, as they're doing early evaluation. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1973.0s)]
*  And again, there's not it's not like there's one phenotype or profile for an entrepreneur founder. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1986.0s)]
*  But I do believe fundamentally that my team, as they're assessing all the different elements of PTS and market size, there is a people element that they are assessing in their own way. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=1991.0s)]
*  And they're making an evaluation. And it is an incredibly important part of the overall philosophy of how SR1 invests. And so that, you know, again, there's some trial and error there. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2002.0s)]
*  We don't always get it right. We sometimes have to make changes. We have to add capabilities. But it is a core core element to the way that we underwrite our investments at SR1. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2014.0s)]
*  And so everyone is spending time thinking about this holistically, starting from the CEO and then thinking through the organization. Yeah. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2026.0s)]
*  I'll give you one more point, a little bit of a preview for what's to come with SR1. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2034.0s)]
*  You know, so we've added these incredible capabilities to help with summiting around sort of the CFO type leader within SR1 that works with our entrepreneurs to help them raise capital, to help them build out their finance function. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2039.0s)]
*  That's Chris Chai, who's been a serial CFO, just an incredible talent and just such a joy and privilege to have on my team. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2052.0s)]
*  We have Iqbal Mufti, who is his counterpart on the pharma business development side. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2059.0s)]
*  So think of him as the CBO within SR1, who's really spending most of his time interacting between portfolio companies and the large and mid-sized pharma players, building relationships, enabling connectivity way before there's any sort of deal to be had or not. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2064.0s)]
*  The next capability that we will add will be what we call a talent or people capability. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2080.0s)]
*  It'll be someone that sits as part of the SR1 team to help us when we are exactly to your question, to help us assess teams, have a uniform way to be able to to evaluate, to think about where the blind spots to think about how we can help to augment, bring in talent. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2086.0s)]
*  So that will be a core internal capability of SR1. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2103.0s)]
*  And so we are, you know, action speaks louder than words. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2107.0s)]
*  And so we really are committed to this part of how we build what we call an SR1 edge or spike in the way that we invest in biotech. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2110.0s)]
*  Yeah, very cool. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2118.0s)]
*  And totally acknowledging that there's not a, you know, quote unquote, phenotype. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2120.0s)]
*  Are there like must have boxes that need to be checked or common threads that you look for and say, OK, well, like this is this is going to play heavily into our decision in terms of the people that are leading these companies? [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2127.0s)]
*  You know, the one the one trait is, again, like the resilience, grit, determination, just self belief that, again, I don't know if you can teach that, but that that trait, I think, is sine qua non for what we do as an as a ecosystem. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2142.0s)]
*  You need to have that as part of your being. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2158.0s)]
*  And you've spent time with Rami. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2161.0s)]
*  You'll know he's he's Superman. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2162.0s)]
*  Like he comes out and he's ready to take on the world and that entrepreneur needs to have some element of that capability within themselves to do incredibly impossible or near impossible things. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2164.0s)]
*  So that's the first piece of the puzzle. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2177.0s)]
*  You know, beyond that, it really is hard to be prescriptive. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2180.0s)]
*  Like I've worked with some incredibly talented entrepreneurs that aren't don't have the profile. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2183.0s)]
*  They haven't been in pharma or in biotech first time into a role like Sam Kulkarni is a great example at CRISPR. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2189.0s)]
*  He was a McKinsey consultant before he jumped into CRISPR. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2197.0s)]
*  And, you know, within a few years was the CEO of the company and, you know, is is, in my opinion, one of the best biotech CEOs that's out there, if not, if not the best. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2200.0s)]
*  And then we have others that have been dyed in the wool. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2210.0s)]
*  Entrepreneurs Gary Glick at Odyssey is a great example, who's done done this through multiple iterations and is doing incredibly well. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2213.0s)]
*  We have scientifically trained business trained. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2221.0s)]
*  So it really does. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2224.0s)]
*  There's no one size fits all. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2225.0s)]
*  But that self belief, that tenacity, resilience is the key thing. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2227.0s)]
*  Maybe the second piece, I would say, though, self-awareness is really important, both in terms of how you build capability around you. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2231.0s)]
*  So understanding where you're strong, where you need to add depth and capability, self-awareness at the board level, how you engage with your investors, directors in a way that allows for a really, again, you know, an environment that is conducive to ultimately executing on on the plan of the startup. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2239.0s)]
*  Right. That's that's an important element, too, I would say. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2260.0s)]
*  It's interesting. Self-aware. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2263.0s)]
*  And we could talk all day about this philosophically, but it intrigues me. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2265.0s)]
*  Self-awareness, you know, in my mind requires a healthy dose of of humility. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2269.0s)]
*  And we talk you talk about Superman, like, you know, you talk about Rami like, yeah, I get that impression, too. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2274.0s)]
*  And I've spent enough time with them to and I credit myself with a little bit of decent gut and intuition. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2279.0s)]
*  Like, I believe that I got to be genuine. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2286.0s)]
*  I believe him to be the real deal after spending time with them. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2287.0s)]
*  But I've seen a lot of, you know, self-described supermen who maybe weren't, you know, maybe didn't have the humility to apply some self-awareness. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2291.0s)]
*  And, you know, maybe maybe weren't those super people. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2301.0s)]
*  So that I guess it just reinforces the point you've made about about gut and intuition. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2306.0s)]
*  Right. Like, like, how do you vet? [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2314.0s)]
*  How do you how do you aside from, you know, credentials and training, how do you vet? [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2317.0s)]
*  How do you vet genuine? Yeah. You know what I mean? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2325.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's not easy. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2328.0s)]
*  It's not easy. And again, I think the ways to potentially mitigate against making a wrong determination there is seeing someone over time. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2330.0s)]
*  So a longitudinal experience can be really helpful. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2338.0s)]
*  So in the case of Rami, I've known him since he was at Wharton or finishing Wharton all the way through to when he joined as the Arcelic CEO. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2341.0s)]
*  So I've seen him over many roles and years and careers. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2350.0s)]
*  I know I know who Rami is. I know his authenticity, how genuine he is. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2353.0s)]
*  I won't always have that opportunity with everyone that I'm working with. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2358.0s)]
*  But in general, I will try and spend time with entrepreneurs and founders over an extended period. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2362.0s)]
*  Right. Get to know them before, frankly, their companies raising capital, get to know the company before they're actually raising capital. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2368.0s)]
*  So it's not so much of a forced interaction around a specific ask or point in time. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2374.0s)]
*  So I think about I think that's one way. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2380.0s)]
*  I do think you have to be comfortable with your intuition and gut. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2383.0s)]
*  And then, again, referencing can be, if done appropriately, can be done in a way that can really peel the onion to layers and depth that can really give you a better sense of the person. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2386.0s)]
*  I think that's helpful. But yeah, you're right. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2398.0s)]
*  I mean, listen, there's some of these key strengths can turn into your weaknesses, too. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2401.0s)]
*  Also, right. So you have to be, you know, you have to sort of be mindful of that. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2405.0s)]
*  And I do want to hone in on one point you, you know, I mentioned first, then you brought up like this idea of like Superman, like I genuinely do believe we need more high, high, you know, high in high positions, women that can represent the broader ecosystem and demographics of our business. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2409.0s)]
*  And if we do that, our companies will be in a better shape, in my opinion, right, to have the diversity of experiences, life experiences, work experiences, just thoughts that a broader set of of the demographic can represent. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2426.0s)]
*  And that's one of the things that I saw one we've certainly been leaning into. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2440.0s)]
*  And I want to acknowledge Jill from my team in particular, who really has been focused on this in terms of getting more women involved at the board level in management roles. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2444.0s)]
*  And I think it's that is a massive opportunity for our entire industry. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2453.0s)]
*  But for us, our one something that we are going to use to our advantage, right, to be able to really differentiate. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2458.0s)]
*  And I think doing this frankly adds to just the richness of these management teams, because I think there's talent that's available that, you know, frankly, has been maybe not looked at in the same light that it deserves to be. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2464.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, good. It's a good point. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2476.0s)]
*  We need to get to a point where the you know, the phrase ology of superwoman rolls off the tongue as easily as Superman, right? [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2479.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. I want to I want to shift gears a little bit to that, you know, back to SR one and what it's doing in the biotech environment, biopharma space that's unique from my perspective, a lot of VC firms. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2486.0s)]
*  I haven't had a ton on the show. A lot of times I'll have a, you know, a managing partner along with a biotech that they funded. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2500.0s)]
*  We've done that a few times. That's always a fun conversation. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2506.0s)]
*  But I haven't had a ton. But from my perspective, anecdotally, a lot of the VC firms that I see out there are a little bit more niche in terms of where their focus is. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2508.0s)]
*  They'll focus on, you know, the biotech, you know, startup seed seed phase. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2517.0s)]
*  They'll focus maybe on taking a company from, you know, formation to phase one studies, or they'll say, hey, we're the you know, we're the we're the we're the capital partner that you need to work your way towards acquisition or merger. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2523.0s)]
*  SR one, on the other hand, you know, in conversation with you, you claim this kind of complete continuum, right approach from startup to commercialization. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2541.0s)]
*  So tell me a little bit more about that. Like, why is that? Why not? Why not just focus on one sort of, you know, phenotype, to use your word of company or why, you know, why why take on that breadth, I guess? [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2551.0s)]
*  Yeah, again, going back to first principles, Matt, I'd say generally don't like to do anything that's just completely straightforward. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2568.0s)]
*  There is a you know, there's a belief that I have that the firm has that we want to be truly elite and to be elite in my mind, you need to have a holistic understanding of this ecosystem and industry. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2575.0s)]
*  And it's hard, in my opinion, to have that mindset or visibility, if you're just focusing in on one particular segment. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2588.0s)]
*  And, you know, again, the example of the way that we've learned about some of these seed investments that we've done in gene editing has come from the experience of being in leadership roles and having invested through the various stages of CRISPR from start all the way through to where it is today and seeing where CRISPR is today. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2597.0s)]
*  What are the bottlenecks again? Delivery, whole gene insertion, more a milder preconditioning regimen. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2617.0s)]
*  That insight has led to early stage seed investments. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2624.0s)]
*  And so we are not we're not claiming to be, you know, again, there's amazing firms that all they do is start companies. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2628.0s)]
*  We're not claiming to have the resources or capabilities just to do that. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2635.0s)]
*  But when we start a company or when we seed an investment, it is driven in some part by an insight that we have from having that arc of investing experience and understanding of where the landscape is or where it's going. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2639.0s)]
*  So that's the first point is we believe that there is an edge that we can glean from having an end to end capability. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2652.0s)]
*  The second point hones in on the team aspect, which we've talked about, which is we we genuinely think of ourselves as one team, one dream. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2660.0s)]
*  And we can get into logistics because we are spread out. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2668.0s)]
*  But what that means is there needs to be for that first point to hold where you can take the learnings, there needs to be the right level of organizational design, cross talk collaboration that's happening so that the organization can benefit from that. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2671.0s)]
*  Right. So we lean into that part of the way that we work to facilitate the learnings and create the edge. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2684.0s)]
*  So those are the two strategic points. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2691.0s)]
*  The third is it's frankly tactical, which is, you know, we fundamentally believe that if you have that end to end approach and capabilities and edge in any market cycle, whether it's risk on or risk off, you will be able to find attractive investments that can generate outsize returns. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2693.0s)]
*  And so you're not dependent on, again, the markets being completely open to early stage and money flowing into that segment. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2711.0s)]
*  There might be later stage deals that are more attractive from a risk entry point. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2720.0s)]
*  And so we think on balance, like the two strategic regions plus the tactical reason makes for a compelling way to build a fund and a franchise over time. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2724.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Well, I'm sold. That was a fantastic response. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2733.0s)]
*  I like that perspective response, you know, being able to fill gaps. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2738.0s)]
*  I mean, it speaks to the mission to like it speaks directly back to the mission. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2742.0s)]
*  Like, what do we need to what do we need to invest in right now to make what we've already seen through to commercialization better, more effective, more efficient. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2745.0s)]
*  That's that's great. But you mentioned the logistics. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2753.0s)]
*  You mentioned geographies. You guys are London split between London and in San Francisco. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2756.0s)]
*  So tell me a little bit about that. What's advantageous about having are you in San Francisco now? [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2762.0s)]
*  I'm in London right now. I'm in London right now. Oh, you're in London right now. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2768.0s)]
*  OK, you spend most of your time there. I mean, I'm going back and forth. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2772.0s)]
*  One of the challenges or challenges or blessings, I guess, depending on how you how you look at it. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2776.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Pick worst cities. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2783.0s)]
*  But what's advantageous about having I mean, I've had conversations about, you know, the investment scene and innovation specific to Europe. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2787.0s)]
*  And I've had conversations about how that's different in the states, you know, where there's different sort of focus in the states. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2796.0s)]
*  So I'm assuming like, you know, answer the answer my own question. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2803.0s)]
*  One of the advantages is the kind of holistic view of what's going on there and what's going on here. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2806.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. I mean, again, it just broadens out the network. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2811.0s)]
*  Right. So I talked about the importance of network in the way that we think about, you know, ultimately getting to the most compelling founders, entrepreneurs, startups. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2814.0s)]
*  So having a foot on both sides of the Atlantic gives us, we believe, an edge relative to a U.S. focused investment firm. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2822.0s)]
*  It's also just, again, I go back to, again, the way that SR1 is organized. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2829.0s)]
*  We have incredible talent on my team that is based in the UK or in Europe. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2834.0s)]
*  And having those people without those people here, I'm not sure we would be set up this way. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2839.0s)]
*  Right. So not only is the investing team a meaningful portion based here, but the operations team, including our CFO, who's one of the most talented people that I work with full stop, is based here in the UK office. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2843.0s)]
*  And so it's really to be able to cultivate a way of working together that allows for people to sort of have their personal preferences for where they want to live, coupled with, again, the mission of SR1 to invest in these geographies. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2855.0s)]
*  I think those are those are really the two major reasons that we've done it. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2867.0s)]
*  And it's also been the case, you know, while it's, again, logistically challenging setting up meetings, you know, across these time zones, you know, we've we've found a way to make it work. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2871.0s)]
*  You know, we have enough connectivity in the way that teams are organized when they're evaluating companies working with portfolio companies. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2880.0s)]
*  We probably have two or three times during a year where the core team is together between JP Morgan or other conferences or board meetings. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2888.0s)]
*  We're all, for example, in Boston. So we have to invest in this. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2896.0s)]
*  There's a cost associated with it. We think on balance, it makes sense for us. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2900.0s)]
*  It's worth it. But it does add a complexity to what we do. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2905.0s)]
*  And, you know, I want to acknowledge that it's not it's not without friction that comes with the setup. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2909.0s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. One of the other advantages that occurs to me is that you've got an ear to the ground on where the money's coming from, the flow of money, the interest levels in each of the different sectors. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2914.0s)]
*  And you know, you've got to have a sense of where the money is coming from, the levels in each in each space. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2925.0s)]
*  So can you share any like it? Well, one, is that true? [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2932.0s)]
*  Like and two, what what trends or observations can you share about the way that money is and has been flowing in Europe versus the states? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2935.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's definitely been, you know, I'd say over my investing career. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2947.0s)]
*  I think the amount of capital that flows into biotech relative to U.S. [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2951.0s)]
*  right in Europe. And, you know, my experience has been that for the most part, European biotechs have been more drip fed capital, incremental amount of capital infusions to get to the next milestone. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2956.0s)]
*  And you could argue in the U.S. maybe companies have been overfed at time and there's indigestion that comes from overfeeding. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2968.0s)]
*  But I'd say over the last few years, you know, there's there's just more activity here in Europe. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2975.0s)]
*  We've always known there's high quality science here, great institutions, the pedigree is as good as we see in the U.S. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2980.0s)]
*  But there is now more capital certainly from us and from other large players flowing into this ecosystem on the private side. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2986.0s)]
*  And so I think that's a reason to be optimistic. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2993.0s)]
*  But the reality is, at least based on, you know, July 31st, while we're recording this podcast, the public markets are largely U.S. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=2996.0s)]
*  based for all of these startups, wherever they're like CRISPR is a good example. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3004.0s)]
*  You know, Swiss based company that is now listed on NASDAQ has operations in the U.S. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3008.0s)]
*  So the flow of capital on the private side, it's I wouldn't say it's even, but it's starting to rebalance in a way that's favorable to Europe. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3014.0s)]
*  But as you skew towards later stage and the public markets, you know, all of the major action happens in the U.S. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3021.0s)]
*  And I don't see that changing for the foreseeable future. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3028.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, very good. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3031.0s)]
*  We're running short on time here, Simeon, but before I get to my final question for you, which is the hardest question to answer, [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3033.0s)]
*  what haven't I asked you? What haven't I asked you that you think would be valuable information for our audience of biotech builders? [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3042.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd say again, find sort of the purpose, the calling for why the entrepreneur, the founder, the startup exists. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3052.0s)]
*  Like, why do you exist? And if you have if you can be really aligned with that mission and focus on that, everything else will you know, [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3059.0s)]
*  you will be able to work through it. You'll have that sort of mindset. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3068.0s)]
*  You'll have the resilience and belief in what you're doing. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3071.0s)]
*  And again, nothing is easy that you know, nothing great is easy. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3074.0s)]
*  And so, you know, I'm inspired every time I meet entrepreneurs and founders that are on that journey that have that belief system on what they're working on. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3078.0s)]
*  And, you know, so I wish I wish everyone all the best and as much luck as they can garner also. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3085.0s)]
*  Well, you answered you answered the last question I was going to ask you. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3092.0s)]
*  So, yeah, the last question I was going to ask you is the hardest question to answer. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3096.0s)]
*  And that's, you know, this like this this this pithy and meaningful piece of advice. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3099.0s)]
*  So so I don't know. I don't have the last question to ask you. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3103.0s)]
*  That was it. Oh, OK. I didn't I didn't know that was coming. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3107.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd say to sum it up, it's find ways to increase your luck surface area. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3111.0s)]
*  I heard this phrase luck surface and I love it. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3115.0s)]
*  It's like do whatever you can. It requires inspiration, perspiration, preparation, but increase your luck surface area over time and put yourself in position to get lucky. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3119.0s)]
*  That's what I say to myself and my team, frankly, whenever we're together. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3130.0s)]
*  Like that's that's one of the key ways that you put you know, you hopefully are successful. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3134.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like that. Can you attribute that quote to someone or is it escape? [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3140.0s)]
*  I can't remember. I don't know if someone deserves credit for that. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3145.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely not my quote. I read it somewhere and if I find it, I will let you know, Matt, but it's certainly not my quote. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3147.0s)]
*  I love it. It's a good one. It's a good one. That's a perfect one to end on. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3155.0s)]
*  I really appreciate you coming on, Simien. This has been a pleasure. I've enjoyed talking with you. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3159.0s)]
*  I think it's been super insightful for our audience. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3163.0s)]
*  Hopefully we can have you back on when we can share more on great things that companies within the SR1 portfolio are doing. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3165.0s)]
*  I'd love to know. Thank you. It's been a fun conversation and I'd love to come back on and maybe we'll bring an entrepreneur with me also that we've worked with. That'll be fun. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3175.0s)]
*  Yeah, that'll be a blast. I'll get in touch with your people on that. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3183.0s)]
*  OK, all right. Thanks, Matt. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3187.0s)]
*  Thank you, Simien. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3189.0s)]
*  So that's SR1 Capital Management CEO and managing partner, Dr. Simien George. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_b7ICYDZVw&t=3191.0s)]
