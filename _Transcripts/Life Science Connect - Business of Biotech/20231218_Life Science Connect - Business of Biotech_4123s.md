Video Description: On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, we welcome two extraordinary guests - Dr. Neela Patel, a molecular biologist-turned-Chief Business Officer, and Dr. John Mulligan, an academic-turned-founder of newly-formed Bonum Therapeutics. Together, Neela and John will pull back the curtain on Bonum's transition from its predecessor, Good Therapeutics, which was fueled by a high-profile asset sale to Roche. The asset, a PD-1-regulated IL-2 program, was a product of a platform that the new Bonum retains, and its sale to Roche was orchestrated by Dr. Patel. You've seen the terms of the deal in the news, but on this episode, you'll get the inside scoop on how the deal was done, how it set Bonum up for future platform-driven success, and how these two leaders retained its IP and its people through a fast, unique, and disruptive acquisition.

*  Good Therapeutics made a splash last fall when Roche snapped the company up for its [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=39.2s)]
*  PD-1 IL-2 program. The $250 million plus milestones deal, in large part orchestrated by CBO Dr. Nila [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Patel, was a nice one for good, but in a way it left CEO Dr. John Mulligan in a bit of a quandary. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=52.0s)]
*  What should he do now? What should he do with what remained of goods technical assets, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=58.72s)]
*  its intellectual property, and perhaps most importantly, its incredibly talented people? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=63.04s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech. And while everyone saw the deal play out, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=68.32s)]
*  on today's episode of the podcast, we're getting the untold inside stories of both the good [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=73.28s)]
*  therapeutics acquisition and the subsequent rebirth of its heart and soul into Bonham Therapeutics. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=78.72s)]
*  Here to share those stories with us are none other than Drs. Nila Patel and John Mulligan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=85.6s)]
*  Nila and John, welcome to the show. Thanks for having us. Glad to be here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=91.12s)]
*  I'm honored. I'm honored to have you guys here. And I want to get to know, like, we're going to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=96.32s)]
*  do some backstory stuff before we get into the acquisition and the subsequent rebirth [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=100.4s)]
*  of the company as Bonham and how all that played out. But first I want to get to know you two a [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=104.8s)]
*  little bit. Nila, your background is intriguing to me. You had this PhD in molecular biology, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=110.24s)]
*  seemingly, you took that seemingly directly into a career in the biopharma industry doing research [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=117.52s)]
*  at Roche. Was that your intent back then? Like when you were working through that PhD, did you [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=124.0s)]
*  want to come into industry right away or was it sort of an opportunity that moved you away from [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=129.2s)]
*  academia? What was your intent? You know, actually it was my intention and I was not necessarily [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=133.12s)]
*  exactly as my classmates were. Many of them wanted to stay in academia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=142.0s)]
*  The backstory for me is that I did a summer internship at a very young Genentech when it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=146.8s)]
*  was an unrenovated warehouse. And that got me really excited about a career in drug discovery. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=151.68s)]
*  I felt like it was something where I could help people and that it would be intellectually [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=159.28s)]
*  challenging. And I looked around at the folks who were working there and realized I wanted to work [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=163.36s)]
*  on the strategic side, help make decisions about the kind of programs we would pursue, the way we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=170.72s)]
*  pursued them. And I realized I needed to get a PhD in order to do that. So I knew all along that [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=176.0s)]
*  that was my goal. Yeah. Yeah, that's interesting. I'm going to ask you some questions I think later [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=183.44s)]
*  on about the transition into the business side of it as Chief Business Officer. But John, I want [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=189.2s)]
*  to learn about your transition into industry as well. You had a pretty established position [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=195.04s)]
*  in academia. You moved from research right into founding Blue Heron and then onto like serial [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=201.76s)]
*  biotech entrepreneurship. And I'll ask you some questions about that later as well. But what was [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=208.16s)]
*  your intention? What was the allure to biotech? Yeah, so I as an undergrad and grad student worked [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=212.16s)]
*  for faculty members going through tenure. And that kind of turned me off the whole idea of academia. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=220.24s)]
*  So in my postdoc, I was on Davis. He and David Bostime were setting up on the Human Genome Center [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=227.04s)]
*  and offered me a position there helping set that up. So I spent three years doing that. And the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=242.72s)]
*  contrast between a program like that, where we were trying to bring together a whole bunch of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=248.0s)]
*  different disciplines to solve a problem and being in a sort of narrow academic department really [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  pushed me in the direction of industry. So the next job that I took was at Darwin Molecular as a [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=258.48s)]
*  Director of Genomics there, really given the mission to try to apply genetics in the newly [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=264.56s)]
*  new nascent sequencing technology to drug discovery. And so that and what I loved about that company [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  was the multidisciplinary aspect of having chemists and software developers and geneticists and [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=282.64s)]
*  biologists, immunologists all working together to try to solve an interesting problem. But [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=290.8s)]
*  that company, we didn't have a clue. We had a whole great scientific team and we did some [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=298.64s)]
*  really interesting stuff, but really no clue as to how to operate this business. What our real [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=305.44s)]
*  business model was. Now the model was basically become a pharmaceutical company, but with no like [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=313.12s)]
*  idea of steps in between. And so that's what got me into starting my first company was really [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=318.32s)]
*  the thinking, I moved from an academic environment into a company and just started thinking a lot [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=326.0s)]
*  about the business models. Like how do you make the science work well and still make sense as a [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=332.8s)]
*  business? I mean we had a fantastic board. It was Lee Hood and George Rathmann and Bill Gates and [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=339.04s)]
*  Paul Allen. I mean you couldn't have picked a better set of business leaders and yet somehow [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=348.56s)]
*  as a company we couldn't come together as a business. Yeah, that had to provide a lot of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=354.48s)]
*  learning experience for you. The stumbles, scraping your knees along the way. I'm thinking about it [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  like in terms of Neela's transition. She experienced, had a taste of industry first and then decided, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  boy the PhD would really help me sink my claws into this space. You came in from academia and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=369.92s)]
*  to your point the establishing of the business aspect was a bit challenging. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=376.48s)]
*  What was like in terms of that challenge, what was key to I guess wrapping your mind around [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=382.4s)]
*  you know coming out of this narrow you know very pointed focus in academia and research. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=390.08s)]
*  What did you find most challenging like the best learning experience around okay [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=397.28s)]
*  you know here's what I'm going to need to apply to make a business case? I think you can apply [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=401.04s)]
*  you can apply the same kind of problem solving skills that you need. I was a geneticist by [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=406.24s)]
*  training and I mean the core of that as an intellectual discipline is figuring out what [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=410.64s)]
*  the problem is and then figuring out a good way to solve it and so it's the same I mean [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=416.96s)]
*  all the same intellectual tools apply to business. The same kind of creativity coming up you know [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=423.92s)]
*  seeing what's actually there and seeing how you can make something work and then as with science [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=429.2s)]
*  there's a long period of struggle and you know takes for every if you're doing anything on the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=435.12s)]
*  cutting edge of science most of what you do is wrong and learning how to sort of deal with that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=440.8s)]
*  is part of being a good scientist and that also applies well in the world of business where [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=447.44s)]
*  you're going to you know you make mistakes and then you correct. Yeah does does what's more [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=453.20000000000005s)]
*  consequential being wrong in science or being wrong in business? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=460.24s)]
*  If you're playing it right it's you're going to be I mean you have to plan to be wrong some of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=466.32s)]
*  time and so that's the whole strategy is to be able to succeed without being right all the time [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=470.24s)]
*  that's like the core of how to make either of them work. Yeah yeah yeah that's interesting. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=477.12s)]
*  Neela you another interesting inflection point in your career after you you know earned that PhD [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=482.0s)]
*  established yourself an industry you spent time at places like Genentech and Abbott, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=489.12s)]
*  AbbVie, Seattle Genomics just to name a few and then at some point you joined Good which was at [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=493.36s)]
*  the time a much smaller company and you know we see this quite quite frequently but I'm always [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=500.24s)]
*  interested in the intention there you know sort of what motivates that move away from [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=504.72s)]
*  BigBio as we know it to a startup. Absolutely and I would say that in the first half of my career [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=509.6s)]
*  I worked in on the R&D side you know in a lab then leading a lab then leading a small group [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=517.28s)]
*  and then leading you know research in a small biotech company so I had a good feel for what [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=525.36s)]
*  it took to get to move a drug forward or identify from discovery all the way through IND filing [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=531.92s)]
*  and then when I went to business development you know I had been looking for a startup [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=539.04s)]
*  to join where I could have a really significant impact on the company [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=544.48s)]
*  and I looked around at a few companies and they just didn't seem suitable for me so when I joined [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=549.36s)]
*  BD on the buy side I realized that I would have this great opportunity to look at hundreds and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=557.04s)]
*  hundreds of companies which I did I mean on average maybe 400 to 500 a year and it took me [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=563.36s)]
*  12 years to find a startup that met my criteria. Wow. Yeah I wanted a company that had a platform [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=570.48s)]
*  so it would not just be a single product company you know heads up or tails up and that's it. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=578.08s)]
*  I wanted one where that platform had some proof of concept that the thing actually was working. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=586.32s)]
*  Team was incredibly important to me because I'm at a point in my life where I want to enjoy my work [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=593.36s)]
*  life and I want to enjoy my colleagues and I wanted a board that I could work with because [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=599.28s)]
*  we've all seen that boards can have an incredibly big influence positive and negative on outcomes [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=604.64s)]
*  that accompany so I felt like good therapeutics checked every box it was like winning the lottery [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=611.68s)]
*  for me. I was really thrilled to join and I couldn't be happier with my you're not just [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=618.0799999999999s)]
*  you're not just saying that because John's on the call with us. No I'm really not you can ask my [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=623.1999999999999s)]
*  parents they're like you sound so happy in this job. John. CJ was evaluating we were talking about [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=627.44s)]
*  a deal with CJ and talking and Neila was on the other side of that discussion and we did wait until [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=635.0400000000001s)]
*  CJ rejected us before we made it you know the actual job offer. John tell me about that job [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=641.0400000000001s)]
*  offer you know it's interesting I have a lot of conversations with the leaders of biotechs [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=647.44s)]
*  around selection of talent and you know sometimes obviously there are many varying opinions [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=654.08s)]
*  when you see someone like Neila who's got a pretty strong research background a good science [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=662.24s)]
*  background has transitioned into you know more interest in the in the business development side [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=667.6s)]
*  what's like what are the pros and cons there like what's appealing about her background [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=674.0s)]
*  and putting her in a business development position versus you know what might be a [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=678.0s)]
*  potential red flag yeah so there's a couple of aspects of that and one is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=682.56s)]
*  our goal as an organization is to be completely science driven and to not have any other nothing [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=689.92s)]
*  get in the way of making decisions that are based on results which seems kind of obvious but isn't [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=697.1199999999999s)]
*  always true I do not always get in that luxury and so I wanted everybody in management to really be [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=701.92s)]
*  assigned to be somebody who really understood so that's you know a critical aspect of it. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=709.04s)]
*  Another part is just I want a company where and I think we built a company where we can have trust [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=716.8s)]
*  and transparency where you know the people they work with are good at their jobs you can trust [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=725.04s)]
*  them to do their jobs you can focus on your job and there's a free flow of communication so there [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  was a real need to pick people who could fit in an environment like that and there's certain you [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=734.24s)]
*  know it's easier to find like a pure research person who's doing that finding not everybody [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=741.6800000000001s)]
*  but this kindly not everybody in business development is a really nice and straightforward [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=748.5600000000001s)]
*  person and so picking somebody in sales and business development one of the characteristics [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=754.8s)]
*  is being able to just to sell and to convince people of things and so finding people who [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=761.04s)]
*  are real really genuine who are really good at their jobs is it's it's a challenge and I think [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=768.7199999999999s)]
*  that we had you know I've met Neela we other members the company had worked with her in the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  past and so we knew going in that she was going to be a great choice and we had a great project [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  for her to work on that's the other piece in terms of recruiting people is to have some you know [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=787.84s)]
*  motivating people it's really straightforward if there's something really interesting for them to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  do and so the way that we grew the company was to add on functions when they really needed them [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  and so Neela was one of the first hires after we got the results that led to the acquisition by [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=804.88s)]
*  Roche the really cool super interesting animal data so we could show her that data and as a [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=812.16s)]
*  scientist she could evaluate it and say yes this is something that um yeah I'd say on the recreate [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=817.8399999999999s)]
*  east side it was extremely attractive to me to for that philosophy of we are science based we're [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=827.4399999999999s)]
*  fact based and we're not going to go out there with an incomplete data set to try to get somebody [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=836.1600000000001s)]
*  interested we're going to show them what we have all of it and that's what it is and so for me [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=845.12s)]
*  the selling piece of it is not selling something that is you know not a full picture or not honest [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=853.2s)]
*  with the other party at which point it becomes a very easy job in terms of being sincere about [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=862.64s)]
*  being excited about the science and being able to show it in a in a way that's real yeah yeah [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=870.48s)]
*  and I totally appreciate that I mean I think it's uh it's refreshing actually I appreciate it because [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=876.96s)]
*  it is real although not necessarily the standard and bd right and biotech biotech bd can be a [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=882.72s)]
*  flash in the pan kind of you know pretty tough business what about the what about the deal making [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=889.2s)]
*  part of it like you know once you've gotten past the acceptance of of the science and the technology [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=895.5200000000001s)]
*  and you know you're very transparent you're real you're a scientist yourself you understand what [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=902.32s)]
*  you're telling these folks you get to the point where all right let's start let's start wheeling [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=906.32s)]
*  dealing let's start making some deals where'd you learn that neila like where does that come from [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=910.8000000000001s)]
*  um you know I learned that on both sides of the table because throughout my the second part of [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=915.76s)]
*  my research career I was doing I was sitting on the evaluation side for deals and looking at them [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=924.24s)]
*  from a very just pure technical point of view partnering with a bd person and helping give them [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=932.56s)]
*  input like this would be this valuable to us but not more than that so I was more [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=938.48s)]
*  an advising but not at the negotiating table and then at at seigen I was clearly the one negotiating [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=945.04s)]
*  on behalf of seigen in a by role but you know negotiation it almost doesn't matter what side [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=953.12s)]
*  of the table you're on you need to figure out what the key needs of both parties are and if there's a [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=959.6s)]
*  way to get those met and if there's you try to get to that as soon as you can because sometimes [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=965.36s)]
*  it's just a walk away look this is this is our need is this financially and the other side says [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=971.6s)]
*  I cannot do that it's it's it's actually impossible okay we get it we respect and accept that let's [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=978.4s)]
*  move on so I feel like the the fundamentals of negotiating understanding the other party's needs [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=985.84s)]
*  understanding yours looking for creative solutions something that John mentioned before being really [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=992.0s)]
*  creative how can we make this pie bigger how can we make this happen and have everybody come out [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=997.1999999999999s)]
*  with with what they wanted yeah Neela I had a couple episodes ago a couple episodes prior [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1003.36s)]
*  to the airing of this episode I had uh excuse me new had Hussini who's the the vp of business [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1010.3199999999999s)]
*  development at Regeneron on the show and he's he's responsible for quite a few of Regeneron's big [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1016.24s)]
*  deals and the entire episode was focused on you know his introspective look at his art and science [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1021.6s)]
*  of deal making it was great and I asked him this question I want to ask you the same question [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1028.0s)]
*  he gave me I'm not going to tell you how he answered he gave me a really good really good [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1033.28s)]
*  response but I'm going to ask you the same question I asked him because I'm in a motive person [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1036.56s)]
*  that's my kids they'll tell you like you know mom's like super level-headed and cool dad you never [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1041.1200000000001s)]
*  know where his hands are going to go when he's talking uh how do you like you know sometimes you [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1045.84s)]
*  get into a deal opportunity and you become invested in it you become you know professionally perhaps [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1051.6799999999998s)]
*  emotionally invested in the opportunity right like you throw your heart and soul into it [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1057.1999999999998s)]
*  when things aren't going right or when things aren't going like the way you anticipated they [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1062.0s)]
*  will go how do you maintain emotional checks and balances I think from for me you're right you can't [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1065.84s)]
*  you cannot really do a big deal without putting putting putting your heart into it but you have [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1075.6799999999998s)]
*  to keep a little bit of distance as well not only for your sanity but also to be effective at the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1082.24s)]
*  negotiating table because the minute that you flip into the motive I have to get this done or it [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1089.36s)]
*  destroys who I am or my career or whatever you've lost all your power at the negotiating table you [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1098.48s)]
*  can't operate the way you need to so you know for me I've been very lucky to have John and a [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1105.6s)]
*  supportive board as thought partners so we're always working on what is our alternative to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1112.2399999999998s)]
*  getting this deal done let's make sure we have a path forward without the deal in which case [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1119.6s)]
*  when you're at the table yes you're sincere you want to do it you're you know you're passionate [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1127.12s)]
*  about it but you're not do or die about it and that distance is is really valuable [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1132.08s)]
*  that's not to say that there weren't days that I would you know leave the negotiating table and [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1138.88s)]
*  just need to go for a nice walk and see something beautiful or cook a nice dinner or go to ceramics [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1144.8s)]
*  and make something you know with my hands yeah get out the frustration but the other I asked I asked [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1150.72s)]
*  new had that follow-up question I said we actually talked about like you know his like decompression [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1157.68s)]
*  exercises you know I totally get that yeah and John can I just talk about emotive I think there's [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1162.64s)]
*  something in business development and actually in general in interactions in the professional [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1170.3200000000002s)]
*  or even private sphere you need to recognize your emotions and learn to work with them because [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1177.2s)]
*  there were times when I just was so angry and I thought I'm just going to blow my top and I was [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1185.1200000000001s)]
*  like no just take it calm take it easy set that emotion aside and there were other times when I [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1190.0s)]
*  was like oh expressing my frustration or a negative emotion but calmly like hey we feel [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1196.24s)]
*  pretty angry about the fact that you countered with this that's not working for us [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1206.4s)]
*  I sometimes the other side needs to know where you are emotionally you know not just not just [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  numbers on paper but needs to know that they've actually hit your limit or oh things are going [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1219.2800000000002s)]
*  great we really appreciate how hard you're working with us to get this done so you know I think [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1224.64s)]
*  using it and you know using it and modulating in a way that makes sense yeah so self-awareness [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1230.72s)]
*  and knowing your audience yeah yeah John you've done this a few times you've you've sold companies [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1238.08s)]
*  to origin roche obviously eli lily so you've got you've got a bit of a track record for building [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1244.48s)]
*  attractive biotechs can you share some thoughts on common threads among those you know perhaps [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1251.9199999999998s)]
*  hallmarks of some of these companies that you've built whether or not for acquisition companies [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1259.4399999999998s)]
*  that you've built that have been acquired yeah the silver you know just a couple silver bullets [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1264.72s)]
*  that's all well I'm not sure that the path I've taken is really applicable for I mean I can tell [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1270.88s)]
*  you what the hallmarks are but I'm not sure it's I would advise anybody else to do that or this but [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1277.76s)]
*  but the if you look at my the pattern of things that I've done they've all started with an idea [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1284.56s)]
*  and everything we've done has been invented internally so we've never licensed anything in [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1289.52s)]
*  I've tried to focus on just sort of the obvious point of focusing on problems so there's a big [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1296.96s)]
*  impact you know it's just as hard to solve a small problem as it is to solve a really big problem [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1301.76s)]
*  you know there are technical there's like two an axis of technical complexity and value of the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1308.4s)]
*  problem there's very few things in the very valuable low technical complexity area [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1313.6000000000001s)]
*  but there's lots of things in the low value high technical complexity quadrant and so you want to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1319.68s)]
*  kind of pick where both they're hard so that it's worth doing and there's real value there and [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1325.12s)]
*  the other thing for me is every time I've done something new it's been something really new [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1336.72s)]
*  so I did a synthetic you know my first company was a drug discovery company based around [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1342.32s)]
*  sequencing and combinatorial chemistry don't like other the next thing I did was a synthetic [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1349.52s)]
*  biology company where we were trying to automate the moving data from the computer into the lab [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1354.32s)]
*  DNA then I did a diabetes company and now we're in immunonecology and so each time for me it's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1363.68s)]
*  learning a whole new field and so it's like you can bring new insights into a field but to have [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1372.24s)]
*  any impact you also have to bring in people like Diane Hollenbaugh or CSO or Mila or CBO who are [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1380.72s)]
*  who really have knowledge in the field so it's a combination of invention and new perspectives [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1388.72s)]
*  and expertise yeah and I think the other thing I've learned and I'll touch on this [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1395.76s)]
*  in a number of places I think in this discussion is that planning ahead with the knowledge that [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1403.36s)]
*  you know no plan survives contact with the enemy but just with the example of a good discussion [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1413.12s)]
*  a good Roche discussion we had alternatives we were able to do that negotiation because [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1419.04s)]
*  I lined up a financing that was structured to support that we were actively pursuing taking [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1424.96s)]
*  molecule into the clinic ourselves we had the financing and the expertise in place to do that [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1432.4s)]
*  which gave us gave Mila the opportunity to walk away from the table which you have to have [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1438.08s)]
*  that optionality yeah yeah yeah so what was let's get into that good good therapeutics [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1444.96s)]
*  acquisition deal you know I didn't know how to phrase it like I think I called it a sell [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1452.96s)]
*  and pivot for I don't know if you'd characterize it that way yeah but leading into it what was [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1459.4399999999998s)]
*  what sort of drove the acquisition opportunity with with Roche well I can't speak to Roche's [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1467.12s)]
*  internal decision making obviously but I can comment that they had their own PD-1 IL-2 program [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1474.8799999999999s)]
*  that was in the clinic and so they already had established preclinical models and they knew what [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1483.44s)]
*  their clinical data looked like it wasn't published at that point but that was in their in their shop [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1489.2s)]
*  so they were extremely well positioned to be able to evaluate our molecule versus theirs and to be [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1494.96s)]
*  able to recognize the value in fact they spent about a year under MTA evaluating the molecule [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1503.44s)]
*  you know prior to us signing signing the deal I'll also just comment a bit on the acquisition [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1511.3600000000001s)]
*  structure which we can come back to you but that structure of acquisition really allowed Roche on [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1517.92s)]
*  day one to have full control over the program and we often see deals where the small biotech wants [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1524.56s)]
*  to do co-development wants to be at the table wants to have a JRC and so on and that you know [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1532.08s)]
*  that can really slow things down I'm not saying there aren't places and times when co-development [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1539.1999999999998s)]
*  is the right thing to do but in this circumstance it was both our goal to to sell the asset [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1544.0s)]
*  outright that gave an early return to our investors and it was Roche's goal to be able [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1551.76s)]
*  to take that program forward in the way that they thought was best for the molecule so both the deal [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1558.56s)]
*  structure as well as their experience with PD-1 IL-2 I think were key factors. I'm gonna ask a [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1564.64s)]
*  follow-up to that that I invite both of you to comment on and that's just around the general so [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1573.1200000000001s)]
*  this was uh November of last year that the deal was finalized is that correct November 22-ish [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1578.4s)]
*  and that's when the financing the post-financing was done so the deal was done [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1584.32s)]
*  September 26th was the actual close date okay yeah um and even I mean for the for the past several [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1589.84s)]
*  two or several years IL-2 has been uh you know it's been a space that's gotten some it's been [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1597.04s)]
*  banged up right like there have been a lot of losers in that space a lot of companies have been [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1602.7199999999998s)]
*  um have we'll say they've struggled their way through right I mean was there any concern [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1607.2s)]
*  uh going into the deal or or did it was that part of the motivating factor like you know the space [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  has suffered some bumps and bruises you know I think that's actually central to a lot of the [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1620.32s)]
*  dynamic of the list which is that we did obviously we're talking to other buyers potential buyers [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1627.12s)]
*  before we had this discussion what Roche had that nobody else had was the ability to run our [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1632.72s)]
*  molecule through their mouse models right next to the molecule they already had in the clinic [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1639.04s)]
*  and so they they had human clinical data on our positive control or a molecule that we used as a [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1644.32s)]
*  positive control and that that let them see the value of an IL-2 product in a way that nobody [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1650.16s)]
*  else could yeah yeah I will just say that well well there is a graveyard of of you know second [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1656.56s)]
*  generation IL-2s out there many of them not yet done right the clinical data with IL-2 itself [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1665.6s)]
*  it's it's compelling yes it's it's extremely toxic patients have to be in the ICU you know to [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1673.44s)]
*  receive it so that nothing goes wrong and you know I think that that there is clear clinical [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1681.28s)]
*  evidence that IL-2 if it could be safely administered could make a difference you know to the trajectory [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1688.0s)]
*  of patients disease I think that that right I mean John do it do yeah IL-2 alone monotherapy [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1695.3600000000001s)]
*  with IL-2 even though it's no longer used is for long-term outcomes is not a whole lot worse than [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1702.88s)]
*  checkpoint which is a huge drug it's a it's like low double digits high single digit for for [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1709.68s)]
*  durable responses so that's a real it's a real drug it's just not quite good enough and it's [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1718.3200000000002s)]
*  way way too toxic and so I wanted to get back a little bit to the structure of the structure [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1726.4s)]
*  of the deal and I guess we'll come back to the pivot but I mean we did part of the structure [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1734.08s)]
*  and part of the when we were doing the series a for good part of the pitch was we're going to sell [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1742.32s)]
*  at least the first program or two as an individual asset and get a return to investors because one [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1749.28s)]
*  of the kind of I don't think it's pretty broadly recognized now that in the past platform companies [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1755.76s)]
*  have had a real sort of structural problem which is that you get together this great [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1762.48s)]
*  group of scientists you solve some really cool new problem you developed a tool that will give [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1770.4s)]
*  you a new drug and as soon as you get your first new drug 90 percent of the value of the company [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1776.48s)]
*  is that new drug and there's a really strong incentive to put all of your investment that [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1781.3600000000001s)]
*  just drags it's like a black hole that drags all of the resources of the company forward to the [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1787.44s)]
*  detriment and it takes a whole different set of people to do that than it takes to do the to [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1793.28s)]
*  have built that first drug and though so what I wanted to do in setting up the structure was to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1799.68s)]
*  keep the value of all the work that we've done to get to that point and so we really I mean we had [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1806.88s)]
*  planned this structure the spin right from the start it was the goal of the company was to [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1813.4399999999998s)]
*  stay together as a team and be able to spin out these individual programs [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  so you knew that like prior to even sitting down at the having conversations with Roche John you [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1826.1599999999999s)]
*  it was part of how we selected and that was something that the investors bought into before [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1832.24s)]
*  they made their investment the series a investors when you when you enter into the conversation [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1838.48s)]
*  with Roche with that mindset you know knowing that you want to keep this team you want to keep this [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1846.56s)]
*  platform you want to maintain that ip in those assets and move forward as an as a new entity [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1851.1200000000001s)]
*  does it does it take anything away from you in the in the negotiation from your company like does [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1856.0s)]
*  it give you I guess remove any any leverage or look less attractive to the buying company [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1861.92s)]
*  if you look historically people have paid the same amount for a single asset as they will for [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1868.24s)]
*  I mean that's that's the that's the the monetary way of expressing that which is we could have sold [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1872.72s)]
*  the whole company for basically the same price because that's what the value is the value is that [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1878.48s)]
*  first program yeah and interestingly you know Roche's perspective when when we explained our [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1884.24s)]
*  how we wanted to manage the transaction they actually were quite happy they didn't have to [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1892.72s)]
*  deal with lease obligations employees and associated benefits equipment reagents other agreements to [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1898.88s)]
*  which we were party would took care of all of that for them I will say there was a lot of paper work [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1906.64s)]
*  and a very long punch list you know that we worked through but at the end of the day they were [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1912.64s)]
*  happy they wanted the intellectual property related to pd1 il2 and they needed a license [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1920.48s)]
*  to our core platform technology to be able to practice that and and we were able to cleave [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1927.4399999999998s)]
*  that off very cleanly by leaving that in good therapeutics and taking all the employees leases [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1934.32s)]
*  all those other things I just mentioned and moving those over to bonum and it gave us it gave bonum [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1942.1599999999999s)]
*  a really quick start we didn't look like a typical series a company because on day one [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1949.28s)]
*  of our funding we had a fully operational company with people coming to work who had all the [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1955.84s)]
*  equipment they had programs to work on and we were just off the racing blocks rapidly so [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1963.52s)]
*  you know for us it was advantageous as well I don't there was never a point where Roche expressed a [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1970.16s)]
*  desire to have any of those things that we had it really wasn't on their table when we went in and [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1976.56s)]
*  that didn't seem to be a problem I think that yeah as a man said I think they saw it at least as [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1983.6799999999998s)]
*  neutral maybe as an advantage yeah I mean making uh let's say that there was no acquisition uh [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1988.72s)]
*  let's say that good therapeutics just decided for for whatever reasons whatever strategic reasons it [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=1995.84s)]
*  was going to rebrand itself and maybe you know shift a little bit in terms of its pipeline [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2000.88s)]
*  strategy and portfolio strategy that's that in and of itself isn't a trivial task like when you [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2007.44s)]
*  when you're managing your way through a significant acquisition and simultaneously you know crafting [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2012.5600000000002s)]
*  albeit you know recognizing that you've got the staff you've got the infrastructure you've got the [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2021.2s)]
*  people still change you know creating a new company essentially it's a you know that's a lot to have [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2025.0400000000002s)]
*  on your on your plate all at once so John like tell me a little bit about that when you were [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2029.84s)]
*  preparing for you know okay post post acquisition here we are here's Bonham [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2035.12s)]
*  what went in how do you manage your way through that simultaneous activity that's a big question [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2042.3999999999999s)]
*  I know yeah so it spun Bonham off about a year a little over a year year and a half before [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2047.6799999999998s)]
*  and so we've been thinking about it all along and when they when the actual you know signing the deal [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2053.92s)]
*  occurred everybody was laid off on Monday evening and hired back on Tuesday morning so the point of [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2061.6s)]
*  view of working there it's just it was completely seamless and so I think the way that we dealt with [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2068.24s)]
*  the transition was it isn't it wasn't a big pivot or a transition that we had been planning all along [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2075.2799999999997s)]
*  to have many programs running this is the one that leaked to the four it wasn't even the lead [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2082.88s)]
*  program until we got that bit of data it was kind of second in line we got this really compelling [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2089.28s)]
*  mouse data at the end of in you know q1 of 21 and it kind of led to this you know q3 of 22 [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2094.56s)]
*  uh acquisition and so so we've it's been a very intentional even though we're a small company [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2104.32s)]
*  we've always had a lot of programs running in parallel and that really has to do with risk [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2112.88s)]
*  mitigation and making sure that we have it's it's the key to being able to make the right scientific [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2119.84s)]
*  decisions is to be able to do it without fear and so we had enough programs going so that we [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2127.44s)]
*  can always look at the science and say well this one is this is down prioritized or maybe even [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2135.36s)]
*  we're not going to work on this one anymore because there's a lot of bunch of other stuff [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2141.28s)]
*  that's just as interesting and just as exciting going on and so I think it's really hard to make [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2144.96s)]
*  good decisions if you know your house depends on it or you know your your living depends on it [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2151.52s)]
*  you have to have an environment where those decisions are as free as possible from the really [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2157.92s)]
*  hard economic consequences and so so we've the the way to survive a transition like that is to [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2164.64s)]
*  make it or to make it effective yes it was a really big change because we shifted from [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2174.64s)]
*  100 focus or you know 80 focus on pd1 il2 to working on all of our other programs once we [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2179.84s)]
*  you know you moved all of the data over to roche but in another way it was just another part of [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2187.44s)]
*  the cycle you know we're we're preparing to go through that again now we've chosen a program [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2192.6400000000003s)]
*  we're going to choose a lead a candidate in q1 or q2 of next year we're shifting resources into that [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2199.76s)]
*  program we've even done another spin out to to have to house that program and to give us the option [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2208.0s)]
*  of selling it in the same way we know that early stage biopharmers need support producing and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2215.92s)]
*  scaling a biologic molecule is not easy companies with new or evolving programs need assistance [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2223.36s)]

*  tell me a little bit about that you mentioned you know we we laid everyone off on monday and [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  and brought them back in on tuesday that's great yeah uh 26 team members is that correct we're [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2268.64s)]
*  believe that's where we were at that one yeah 31 now yeah and you didn't know it didn't lose anyone [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2275.2s)]
*  like was was it was there any concern you know with that uh you know with that with that [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2281.6s)]
*  transition it's disruptive regardless i mean you know as smooth as it could possibly be it's still [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2287.36s)]
*  going to be a little bit disruptive was there any concern i think there was a lot of celebration we [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2291.36s)]
*  we all you know we had a structure where everybody who worked for the company participated in that [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2295.28s)]
*  you know in this celebration and in that some of the economic returns from it so [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2301.84s)]
*  it's a strategy that's good for the employees too and one of the things that we tried to do [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2306.08s)]
*  as a whole management team right from the start is be really transparent with people and so [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2312.2400000000002s)]
*  i want to the extent possible you know of course there's stuff that's secret when you're doing a [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2319.6000000000004s)]
*  negotiation but everybody knew this was going on and everybody kind of knew as the the ups and [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2324.32s)]
*  downs and you know you know the probability it was going to succeed what's this week's probability [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2330.0800000000004s)]
*  of success and so i think that also helps keep stability is just the people aren't they don't [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2336.88s)]
*  have to worry that there's something going on that they don't know about yeah and when we [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2343.76s)]
*  said we'd off on monday and you know came to work at bonum on tuesday it wasn't as if they heard that [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2350.4s)]
*  news on friday like sure yeah you know it was it was an ongoing conversation as john said so i think [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2357.52s)]
*  that made it that really did make it seamless and kind of makes it fun to be laid off right [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2364.72s)]
*  right exactly and people were given both letters can we have a week right so yeah and we had you [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2369.52s)]
*  know we we had a big celebration for it and there was a lot of joy and people were excited that [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2375.68s)]
*  something that they had poured so much time and energy into would now continue to move forward [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2381.52s)]
*  and get to patients i mean that's all all of us that's why we do this work yeah to help patients [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2389.12s)]
*  and you know i think it was clear that roche would be an excellent party to to to do that in a way [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2395.2s)]
*  that would set the program and patients up for for the best possible outcome that was a good part of [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2403.04s)]
*  why we were so excited about doing this is as nula says that we really think roche was the best [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2409.92s)]
*  partner for this you know they they've got all along history in i-o-2 they're not somebody who's [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2415.12s)]
*  going to give up on it they did they put three different i-o-2 immunocytokines into the clinic [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2420.4s)]
*  over the course of you know six to eight or ten working on it for the last 10 years they've got [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2428.48s)]
*  you know they've got a history of interest in it and so we were really you know a lot of the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2434.0s)]
*  return from this is going to be on milestones and so we really wanted to make sure that both [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2438.4s)]
*  it had the best chance of getting into the clinic as fast as possible and that they were they weren't [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2444.16s)]
*  going to just you know change their mind two years from now and move on to something else [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2450.72s)]
*  yeah they they struck us as an organization that really had a sense of you know a dedication to [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2456.0s)]
*  making this work and they remain invested in in bonum therapeutics which is a where i kind of want [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  to take the conversation for a minute now because we haven't even discussed the fact that when bonum [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2469.12s)]
*  came came to be it came to be with a 93 million dollar series a last fall which is not again [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  not inconsequential in this current funding landscape tell me a little bit neila did that [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2483.12s)]
*  fall under your auspices as well no and that was in john's court and we made it we made a very [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  mindful decision about that because john had to start those discussions and negotiations [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2496.56s)]
*  while we were in the process of cleaning up and closing you know all the all the little bits and [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2502.96s)]
*  pieces that needed to be done for the roche deal and also just based on his depth of experience [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2509.92s)]
*  it's something that made the most sense for him to lead on yeah so john tell me about that [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2515.44s)]
*  experience uh yeah yeah a lot going on and now you're raising money too um well it was kind of a [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2521.12s)]
*  it was a multi-year process because when we got the pd1 il2 data we started the data in 2021 that [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2528.32s)]
*  was the basis for this acquisition that was a trigger for us to shift from being purely science [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2536.1600000000003s)]
*  to adding a bunch of functions that we need to take that forward first neila for business [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2542.7200000000003s)]
*  development and then david bienvenu to build a protein sciences team and expanding other aspects [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2548.88s)]
*  of the team so we needed more money and we planned to take pd1 il2 into phase one ourselves [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2554.08s)]
*  that's been our plan from the start is to that we're doing these really transformative medicines [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2560.08s)]
*  and that they do most valuable when it's been shown to work in people um so i was in the midst [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2566.7999999999997s)]
*  of doing a series b uh one based on that data and in parallel we initiated these discussions with [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2574.3199999999997s)]
*  roche and we had a good consortium of crossover investors really top level crossover investors [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2583.36s)]
*  who wanted when we were we were in the midst of discussing like a 98 100 million dollar series b [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2593.2000000000003s)]
*  that would let us take pd1 il2 into phase one and you know neil and i at some point [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2600.0s)]
*  came to the conclusion that there was a deal to be made with roche and so we presented this to the [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2609.84s)]
*  board and um our it was a deal that would make sense for the current investors our with our [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2614.2400000000002s)]
*  post money at that point but it wouldn't have made sense if we brought in 100 million dollars [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2624.88s)]
*  you know if we'd had brought in 100 million dollars we would have had a 150 million post [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  um a 250 million deal or it wouldn't have you know wouldn't make any sense give us 150 million now [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2636.6400000000003s)]
*  this year and we give you back 200 million next year that's just not very that's not a venture [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2644.0s)]
*  kind of a deal and so what our board decided to do was to do a bridging series b so we did an [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2648.56s)]
*  internal round that gave us was in two tranches there was a 10 million dollar first tranche and [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2656.32s)]
*  the goal there was just to play out can we do the deal and then the backup was another 20 million [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2662.8s)]
*  dollars if the deal we decided we as a board decided not to do the deal that 20 million would [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2668.8s)]
*  have given us the time to take the program forward and relaunch the series b you know the new was the [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2674.88s)]
*  you know outside investor consortium and so we got the deal done with about you know 100 [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2683.76s)]
*  thousand dollars left in the bank so did a small bridging round [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2689.28s)]
*  bridge loan to get the finances in place but basically it was the same group of investors who [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2699.52s)]
*  you know they got their money back and they put a little bit some a portion of that back in we [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2706.4s)]
*  brought in vivo one new sort of one of this you know sort of top level larger vc funds that can [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2710.4s)]
*  be a transition to you know the anchor of a big series b so we have that in place [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2719.92s)]
*  and it it is it has been a little bit unusual in the sense that our you know very committed board [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2728.4s)]
*  and even during a time of really hard biotech downturn you know that did potentially have a [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2736.24s)]
*  bit of an impact on the deal but it didn't we still got a fantastic deal that was really good [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2742.64s)]
*  for everybody and a good return for the investors and so they were eager to support the strategy [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2747.7599999999998s)]
*  put the money back in and we added vivo yeah putting it together even you know it wasn't [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2756.16s)]
*  it just was sort of weird because our situation because of the particular circumstances was [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2766.7999999999997s)]
*  really different than the rest of the industry yeah because of that difference i'm curious about [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2771.2s)]
*  like i mean neil has mentioned several times that you've got a very supportive board and [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2776.0s)]
*  transparent and you know has the company's back but but because you know that that deal and what [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2781.52s)]
*  you're doing is i just had a conversation with a friend of mine who's a biotech exec recently [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2787.44s)]
*  who's doing some doing some different things and he and he talked about like the investment community [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2793.28s)]
*  and you know sort of the de facto standard of biotech these days whenever things risky doesn't [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2798.8s)]
*  like different you know different different different can be dangerous if you don't look [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2806.24s)]
*  you know if you don't look proven or the same that that can be considered as dangerous so like what [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2810.4799999999996s)]
*  i was there any i guess contention at the board level as the deal kind of came to pass [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2814.9599999999996s)]
*  not really as a deal came to pass i mean all of that discussion happened for the series a i mean [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2824.3199999999997s)]
*  this was we were just doing what we said we were going to do and so that it was contentious the [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2830.8s)]
*  idea of doing a spin out wasn't i mean there were investors who really didn't like that idea [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2837.44s)]
*  of trying to do an individual asset sale and i feel very fortunate to have found a group of investors [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2841.84s)]
*  who were willing to take it we had very little data it was two people working in the lab for a [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2850.88s)]
*  couple of years myself and shannon akata and we had some toy demo models when that funding came [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2856.24s)]
*  through they put in 22 million dollars to support a really developing a whole new class of medicines [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2863.9199999999996s)]
*  of a protein therapeutic i mean it's it's it's easy to say but these really are different [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2874.08s)]
*  that they're they're therapeutics that actually sense their environment and change their activity [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2878.9599999999996s)]
*  and that's something that nobody's done before and you know we you know we had a working model [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2883.6s)]
*  we believed it was doable but it took real vision on the part of the investors to be willing to do [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2892.24s)]
*  that you know they they it was not a it was a it was an investor favorable deal in terms of the [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2897.2s)]
*  economic terms but well deserved yeah yeah i want to i realize that we're i'm abusing your time and [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2906.96s)]
*  i know i'm bouncing around a little bit but i i certainly want to give you an opportunity [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2916.8s)]
*  to get into a little bit about what what bonham is is focused on now what bonham's doing doing next [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2922.4s)]
*  and i don't know to the to the you know to the extent that you can that you can share on that [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2931.04s)]
*  uh you know what is what is sort of the pipeline look like at this point [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2935.36s)]
*  yeah so i can tell you a little bit about the science and then neila will tell you about how [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2939.52s)]
*  we're planning to you know our strategy for this yeah from the scientific point of view our lead [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2942.96s)]
*  program is a lag three regulated il2 so it's a conceptually somewhat similar to the pd1 il2 [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2948.88s)]
*  um it's a way of delivering this potent [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2956.88s)]
*  um cytokine to the cells the t cells that are actually able to attack the tina [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2960.48s)]
*  we also have programs in interferon alpha which is another leotropic incredibly potent [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2968.0s)]
*  effective cytokine that's limited by toxicity it's probably even less popular to patients than il2 [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2976.2400000000002s)]
*  is a number of different programs there we're working on il12 incredibly potent it's now [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2982.56s)]
*  interferon alpha and il2 are approved il12 has never been approved because it's so systemically [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2989.84s)]
*  toxic we're also addressing the tgf beta axis with self-targeted tgf beta inhibitors and starting [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=2995.92s)]
*  to explore areas outside of that autoimmune in particular and so the theme is trying to find [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3006.88s)]
*  places where our we're getting really good at making these regulated molecules at this point [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3017.44s)]
*  and so we we want to grow as a company we'll be taking lag three il2 into phase one [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3024.4s)]
*  um and so we feel that that's like a really important for a drug discovery company having [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3031.8399999999997s)]
*  that within the organization the ability and the knowledge about about early human trials [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3038.3199999999997s)]
*  is a really important stimulus for our ability to make really good drugs and [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3046.56s)]
*  feel much more valuable at that stage so we're we'll be growing as an organization [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3053.12s)]
*  and with continuing on the theme of having a lot of programs running in parallel and then just [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3061.68s)]
*  picking you know if we want to put something in the clinic pre-clinical development each year it's [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3067.7599999999998s)]
*  the one that racists that we had based on both the technology you know technical aspects the science [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3073.36s)]
*  and on interest from potential partners yeah neil i go yeah go ahead meeting our bd strategy [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3078.96s)]
*  as well because you know our internal portfolio programs as john has mentioned are ones that we [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3087.04s)]
*  intend ultimately to partner um we're not going to in the near term be an organization that [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3093.68s)]
*  conducts pivotal phase three trials and we're certainly not building a sales force um but we [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3099.36s)]
*  do see a great deal of value in our platform for making new molecules and so we've got the set that [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3104.72s)]
*  we're doing but obviously with the number of people there's only a certain number of programs [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3112.24s)]
*  that we can undertake and we would like to be able to broaden the reach of our platform technology [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3118.16s)]
*  working with partners so the second prong of our bd strategy is really around collaborations [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3126.08s)]
*  where the partner comes to us with a problem that they want to solve you know a protein that they [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3131.8399999999997s)]
*  want to regulate and what they want to regulate it with we would make bespoke molecules for them [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3137.04s)]
*  and then they would be the ones to to take those programs forward and those are going those [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3144.16s)]
*  discussions are ongoing um and they would let us expand john mentioned that we're now you know in [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3150.0s)]
*  autoimmune disease that's sort of the nearest nearest um switch to taking [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3156.56s)]
*  immuno-onc molecules and now playing them out in the autoimmune space but we see that there's [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3162.72s)]
*  potential for application in many other diseases in metabolic disease potentially in pain um in [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3168.0s)]
*  in fibrosis so um we see that potential it's just that it would not make sense for we want to have [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3176.32s)]
*  a broad portfolio but to start to add all those various therapy areas would not be a wise decision [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3184.08s)]
*  on our part yeah what's your mindset now nila as you as you look forward i mean i know that there [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3191.12s)]
*  are many many moving parts uh and many i guess inflection points between now and and the next [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3198.48s)]
*  deal uh you know so i'm not asking you to look at your crystal ball but do you do you feel like with [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3206.7999999999997s)]
*  every deal that's done like you've had deal making experience with prior companies uh just [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3213.2s)]
*  just um you know orchestrated this great deal with roach do you feel like every deal that's done like [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3218.96s)]
*  does your mind start mapping out more scenarios like early on like are you mapping out the next [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3224.56s)]
*  deal scenario right now or does that sort of play you know does it hit you all at once i guess [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3229.68s)]
*  it's a very vague question but i'm trying to get a a sense of your mindset right like yeah and and [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3235.7599999999998s)]
*  and i i do but it's not in isolation you know these discussions are um with the core uh senior [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3242.24s)]
*  leadership team because each of us brings highly valuable insights to the table and we we do we [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3251.52s)]
*  talk about oh it looks like we have a line of sight for this program to get to a clinical [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3258.64s)]
*  candidate when do we think potential partners would be interested in this what would be the value [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3263.8399999999997s)]
*  inflection points for them how does that match with our expectations for financial return [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3270.72s)]
*  and then okay we start to play that piece out we know one foundational piece that we've always [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3278.24s)]
*  had in mind is that early engagement with potential partners is highly valuable because you start to [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  you hear if you listen you will learn what data they want to see what's important to them and [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3292.72s)]
*  it's i'm not saying that we're going to change our whole strategy but if you hear from three [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3299.52s)]
*  pharma partners hey i'd really like to see this model then maybe we take that under consideration [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3303.68s)]
*  and include it in our plan so we're doing we're doing our very best and with the roche deal [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3310.4s)]
*  you know as part of our history we we're getting the conversations that we want with pharma partners [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3317.2s)]
*  and getting that early feedback and taking that into account as we map out potential deals i mean [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3324.8s)]
*  there you know we all agree understand and agree that it's it's simply potential there's there's no [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3331.1200000000003s)]
*  certainty about it but it does help us to plan and to think through what we need um we need to do that [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3337.2000000000003s)]
*  next yeah what do you what do you find yourself like what's occupying your time now and so yeah [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3345.52s)]
*  you know this is a very it's a naive question but like i'm curious like you know you you spent [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3351.44s)]
*  you know you rolled up your sleeves and i'm sure spent months and months and months doing very [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3356.48s)]
*  very hard work in in terms of diligence and deal making and negotiations and so on and so forth [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3360.56s)]
*  structuring and execution do you i guess maybe i'm answering in part my own question like do [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3366.7200000000003s)]
*  like are you are you working on execution right right now or are you like like what what does a [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3374.3199999999997s)]
*  deal maker spend their time doing when there's not necessarily something on the table to be dealt i [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3381.04s)]
*  guess is the question well i mean the the what you're saying was like i've been on vacation for a [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3385.9199999999996s)]
*  couple months the the deal to deals to be made don't come out of nowhere right there's a lot of [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3392.4799999999996s)]
*  groundwork that needs to be laid ahead of time to make that happen and so you know i've spent a lot [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3401.2s)]
*  of my time over the past year um working out both the strategy and opening those doors with potential [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3408.56s)]
*  either partners for our portfolio programs or collaboration partners and you know as as with [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3417.4399999999996s)]
*  the science you you undertake a lot of experiments and some of them just don't work out and you can't [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3424.32s)]
*  know a priority that they're not going to work out i mean yes if you think it's a silly experiment [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3432.4s)]
*  to do or you think that person that group is never going to be a legitimate partner you don't invest [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3437.1200000000003s)]
*  your time in it but there's many many conversations that just need to be had in order to find out [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3442.4s)]
*  who's serious where it's going to where your values align where you align financially where [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3450.0s)]
*  you align scientifically so i would say that you know the past year has been laying the groundwork [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3456.32s)]
*  like groundwork for for what's going to come next for us do you find yourself on the road a lot [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3462.64s)]
*  doing like a lot a lot of networking and you know we did the entire first deal without ever sitting [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3467.7599999999998s)]
*  down with them in person wow never not a single in-person meeting yeah yeah and so that's like the [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3475.36s)]
*  the standard way of doing business ever since covid right you've adopted the covid the covid [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3483.36s)]
*  methodology exactly exactly so i and the one the one big conference that i did attend i came back [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3487.44s)]
*  with covid so perfect yeah necessarily super excited about that i you know if if it makes sense [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3493.76s)]
*  of course we'll meet in person but i think everyone has adapted to what is the key [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3501.52s)]
*  information that you need and being able to see people's body language on zoom i think we've [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3507.68s)]
*  adapted to this way and it allows everyone to work faster you don't have to wait for schedules to [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3514.08s)]
*  align and you know i can't be away for five days in a row to travel halfway around the world no [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3519.28s)]
*  i'm going to be on the phone with you tomorrow and we're going to hammer this out and get it done [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3525.6s)]
*  and so in some ways it's accelerated our ability to get things done and part of that laying the [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3531.12s)]
*  foundation is building that relationship do i think it would be more efficient to build relationships [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3538.0s)]
*  by sitting down over a cup of coffee with someone probably but we substitute that with okay i'm [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3544.88s)]
*  going to get to know you in advance over time and i'll put the time and effort into it and i'm finding [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3550.88s)]
*  that our partners are happy to do that too yeah so is it a safe assumption that i won't be able [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3556.8s)]
*  to buy you a cup of coffee at jp morgan in a month and a half or so that's probably a safe bet okay [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3562.2400000000002s)]
*  john you either i won't be able to buy you a cup of coffee there although nila is in the bay area [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3568.48s)]
*  so there's some opportunity you might have a non-jpm coincidence you probably wouldn't have to twist [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3572.88s)]
*  my arm too hard to get me out of the market district there for the financial district for [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3578.96s)]
*  an hour or so sounds good during that week [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3584.56s)]
*  nila it strikes me that you know i don't know what's more rare in biotech a fee a woman [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3589.76s)]
*  in the science side of biotech you know like do doing science i'm actually i think i do i [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3599.76s)]
*  think just anecdotally i think a woman in the business development side of biotech is more [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3606.8s)]
*  rare than you know sort of the traditional stem approach would you agree with that like [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3612.64s)]
*  do you do you it's changing i do think it's changing but yes i think when when i started [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3618.88s)]
*  my career that was absolutely the case absolutely the case and and and that even then women were [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3623.04s)]
*  rare in the in the more senior roles but that that is changing um yeah i think you know when i started [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3629.52s)]
*  i was often the only in the room you know only woman in the room presenting to a room full of [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3638.4s)]
*  men and when you know let me just clarify when you started when you say when you started when [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3643.76s)]
*  you started in in business development no when i started in the science side started my career [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3647.92s)]
*  all together um and i would say that i was extremely fortunate i did seek out and i was [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3653.6s)]
*  fortunate to find both bosses who supported me and to build relationships with senior folks [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3660.8s)]
*  who advocated for me so you know i guess the thing for me is i want the path to be easier and better [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3667.28s)]
*  for for women who follow so i do um mentor younger women coming along or people who reach out to me [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3674.4s)]
*  and i consider that part of my professional obligation i honestly consider it part of a [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3682.8s)]
*  professional obligation of men and women not just women uh to do that kind of work because [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3687.0400000000004s)]
*  everyone benefits when we plug in to the best talent it's beneficial for the individuals but [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3693.84s)]
*  it's also highly beneficial for the companies um you know companies it's now we have data to say [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3699.76s)]
*  that companies where there are diverse backgrounds represented in the most senior leadership levels [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3706.4s)]
*  they outperform their peers it's it's it's now established and so it's good for everybody i think [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3714.1600000000003s)]
*  neil you mentioned something that i want to follow up with you on and that's around [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3720.72s)]
*  sort of the opportunity to to create a better more clear maybe more direct path for [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  the women who follow behind you um and i've had plenty of conversations about this with women [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3731.04s)]
*  in biotech where you know if if press i mean quite frankly if pressed on or when i've pressed them on [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3736.08s)]
*  like what does that mentorship look like like how do you kind of codify that and make it make it [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3740.9599999999996s)]
*  daily practice like it's it's one thing to say it right like we should all be lifting each other [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3745.76s)]
*  up and creating opportunity for one another it's another thing to come into work you know every [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3750.8s)]
*  day every week every month every quarter every year and and exercise those muscles so just give [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3755.0400000000004s)]
*  me some not to you know not to put you on the spot but give me some thoughts around like how [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3760.0s)]
*  how do you flex those muscles in a way where you feel like you're actually contributing to the cause [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3765.28s)]
*  um i think that the first thing is to be open to it and to make it clear that you're open because [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3770.0800000000004s)]
*  women have approached me and said hey i heard you say that you were willing and interested [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3776.2400000000002s)]
*  would you be willing to be a mentor to me and what that means is a commitment to meet regularly [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3782.48s)]
*  to listen and hear about what they're doing in their career what they want to do and help them [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3790.48s)]
*  map out the steps that it will take to get to the next place whether that is hey you know you really [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3796.5600000000004s)]
*  should consider getting certified in project management because you you'd be able to open [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3803.28s)]
*  that door or oh i see you really want to go into this field i know somebody there i'm happy to [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  make a introduction for you so it's it's always customized but i think that getting to know the [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3816.1600000000003s)]
*  person um and understanding where they're trying to go and seeing how you can use your network or [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3823.92s)]
*  your knowledge or your experience to help them get there is is really core yeah very good all [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3830.72s)]
*  right i've uh like i said i've been abusive of your time you guys have been very generous with it and [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3837.3599999999997s)]
*  i appreciate that i know i've been steering the ship around in in circles we've covered a lot of [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHFxhYy6uDs&t=3841.04s)]
