# BoB@JPM: Rick Modi, Affinia Therapeutics
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [March 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA)
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech JP Morgan 2025 edition. And I'm here with a man who knows adversity and challenge quite well, Rick Moody. Born in Kenya, 17 years in Kenya. Then he decided to come to the United States of America. This is a story we're going to hear very shortly. His decision to come to the US and earn his degree in physics. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=0.0s)]
*  His degree in pharmacy. And then launch a career in life sciences, leading up to his leadership now at Affinia Therapeutics, where he serves as CEO. So we're going to get right into that story. We're here, by the way. We're here at the offices of Alsten & Byrd, in partnership with Alsten & Byrd. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=28.0s)]
*  And I'm very thankful to Alsten & Byrd. Very reputable law firm in the biotech space. If you have any needs for legal advice in biotech, Alsten & Byrd is the place to be. So check them out. But yeah, we're here. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=53.0s)]
*  I want to start right there. Like I want to hear the story about your decision. What led up to your decision to come to the US and earn a pharmacy degree in Iowa, is that what you're telling me? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=68.0s)]
*  Sure, Matt. So first, thank you for having me here as a guest. Very humbled to be here. Pleasure to meet you. The story is very, very interesting. So I was born in Kenya. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=82.0s)]
*  When people meet me, by the way, said, you don't look Kenya. Like, what is your heritage? I'm Haitian, Indian by heritage. Kenya is a British colony in those days. There were a lot of Indians that they brought to Kenya to do work and they stayed over and started shops and at town they said kids like me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=93.0s)]
*  So spent 17 years in Kenya. Amazing journey living in a third world country. People talk about survival of the fittest. Physically, this is survival of the fittest because you end up getting malaria and you survive it. It's survival of the fittest because there's not enough room in the next classroom. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=107.0s)]
*  And if you are not working hard enough, you get cut out pretty quickly. But I always wanted to get into the medical field. It was pharmacy, physician, those types of careers. And I looked up, I get many people in these sort of countries look up to the US and say, wow, great education, land of opportunity. So I would have this vision and desire to be in the US. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=125.0s)]
*  The pharmacy school in Iowa was one of the top five. So that's how I ended up choosing. It was also one of the cheaper cost of living and for somebody coming from a third world country to do a very well. People talk about a third world country. Cost of living is a major factor. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=146.0s)]
*  So I got admitted in January in Iowa. So Kenya is on the equator. Beautiful weather. Like in the years centigrade, not sure which other place but we're back to that at some other point. Going from like beautiful tropical weather to in the dead of winter Iowa was one story. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=161.0s)]
*  And I also grew up vegetarian. And I only had two food choices in Kenya. It was either corn or beef. You can imagine how long, much longer I was vegetarian after moving to Kenya actually. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=181.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's wild. So you talked about growing up in a third world country and then making that transition aside from the climate and your culinary options. Were you prepared coming out of an education in Kenya to come over here? Were you educationally equipped? I mean, obviously you got in. I'm just curious about that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=193.0s)]
*  Sure. So the education in third world countries is actually very buttoned up. In the case of Kenya, because it was a British colony way back when they followed the British system. So the British system has ordinary levels, advanced levels. They follow the general center to get education, which many people in the US would not know what it is. But they are essentially examinations that place people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=216.0s)]
*  To give you an idea, my high school education in Kenya gave me 32 credit units for the university in the US. So I got a head start on that and also gives you an idea of what the standard of education was. You have to watch the tail off to be honest in a third world country. And the standards are really good. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=240.0s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to also go into English speaking school, which also helped me get past TOEFL and all these other tests that you have to go through to come to the US. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=261.0s)]
*  Yeah. What did your parents do in Kenya? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=271.0s)]
*  Mom was a stay at home parent. My dad was in the banking sector. And when I tell people in the US about the banking sector, they think, oh, it must not make it. No, he was a banking teller. He was in a cashier initially and then worked his way up into the loan department and such. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=274.0s)]
*  But they were hardworking people, made ends meet, just like hardworking people do. Instilled in me work ethics, integrity, all the values that even to this day I look back and I'm so thankful to my parents for supporting me. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=290.0s)]
*  They did fund part of my education, but the rest was classically people that come to the US. They get a job in a lab working in the pharmacy school, which is what I did. And then also, you know, in addition to doing that, the pretty deep and extensive curriculum at pharmacy actually. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=305.0s)]
*  It was fun. Many people, by the way, that come from that old countries too. One of the great things about America is also it's a fun loving place as well. So like every other college kid, I was somebody who had my part of going out to some public or like spring break and doing all the things that college kids do and are probably not supposed to be doing. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=322.0s)]
*  That was part of the fun. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=343.0s)]
*  That was part of the experience, yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=345.0s)]
*  Where did the interest in life sciences come from? I mean, your mom stayed at a mom, your dad was a bank teller in Kenya. You know, but was it your experiences in Kenya with some of the health problems over there and diseases that Kenyans face? What was sort of the nucleus of your desire to put the work in to become a pharmacist? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=346.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a good question. In some countries, such as Kenya, for example, there are some fields that are looked upon as with very deep respect. The health sciences is somewhat. So my initial career choice was actually becoming a physician. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=367.0s)]
*  Yeah, health patients do like by society all those things. Pharmacy was my stepping stone to become an organization. Now this would be very good pharmacy and ended up having a career in pharmacy. I decided to stay put in that. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=383.0s)]
*  I am very happy that I eventually went back to business school actually for my graduate studies. But plan A was becoming a doctor, to be honest, and it was looked in with high regard. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=396.0s)]
*  My kids, by the way, are in their 20s right now. I have twins, twin boys, and they like many kids in that age. They're working right now, but also wondering is this their end stage career? Will they switch careers? And I tell them go and have like do things that you enjoy doing and it will take care of itself. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=407.0s)]
*  It's easier said than done. It's easier at this point to look back and say, yeah, I should just follow my heart and do the things that I enjoy doing. Of course, in the moment when you're debating between a first career or a pharmacist or a physician or going back to grad school for business, in the moment, those are really difficult decisions. But I look back and I say, if you work hard and go with the things that your natural strengths are, you should be okay. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=425.0s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I can appreciate that. I'm a 20 year old and an 18 year old, you know, and the pressures that they've received from every influence beyond their family, you know, to make choices and choose tracks, it can be overwhelming. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=451.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=464.0s)]
*  Those kids sometimes, you know, as dads, we sort of have to give them that safe space to say, look, you know, we've been around and it's not all riding on the decision you make today, right? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=465.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=475.0s)]
*  So yeah, getting back to your career trajectory, the pharmacy to pharma transition, tell me how that came to pass. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=477.0s)]
*  Yeah. So after graduating from Iowa, I came to California, I came to California and did 10 years in the hospital pharmacy line of work. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=487.0s)]
*  It was great because it anchored me. These were patients in the ICD where pharmacists are called upon to dose antibiotics. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=498.0s)]
*  These were babies born prematurely that pharmacists were called in to start IB Nutrition as an example. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=506.0s)]
*  It was you work on the floor side by side with physicians and nurses and patients to lead your expertise as a hospital pharmacist. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=511.0s)]
*  It was great up to a start point. I started getting into administration within that health care system and then I began liking the business aspect of things as well, the administrative part and saw the entrepreneurial things that also coupled becoming a pharmacist as well. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=521.0s)]
*  Was that part of your pharmacy training? Like when you were in pharmacy school, is there a fair degree of like, you know, we're going to equip Dr. Modi to become potentially an independent pharmacist or we're going to teach some business? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=536.0s)]
*  A little bit, I would say, but not that much. Most of the curriculum is geared towards science. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=548.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=555.0s)]
*  I'll say the thing that I learned the most, both from pharmacy school as well as the decade as a working hospital pharmacist. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=556.0s)]
*  They call it SOAP. It's an acronym that physicians use in spite of it when they evaluate patients. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=563.0s)]
*  So the S is for subjective assessment, the O is for objective assessment, the A is for assessment itself, and then you apply them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=572.0s)]
*  Many people in the business world sometimes draw an analogy between the business situation and a patient. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=580.0s)]
*  The treatment is worse as an example, right? It's a bad example for a decision you're making. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=588.0s)]
*  Those are the skills that I would say that I learned a lot more that were more applicable to the business world, but it was very similar in that sense. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=594.0s)]
*  You take metrics that are non quantitative, very subjective. You add metrics that are very objective, quantitative, and then you make an assessment and that's fine. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=601.0s)]
*  It's a very analytical field, the pharmacy field. And those are the skills that helped me. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=612.0s)]
*  Yeah, but more than anything, I would say it was more transitioning from many people with a technical expertise start growing up in the ranks and then end up being in a business type of role. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=618.0s)]
*  I began a second love in that second part of the business world, right? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=629.0s)]
*  And that's where I got compelled enough to say, well, wouldn't it be great to go back to business school and get a graduate degree and do all these things that I'm seeing with new drugs in the hospital on the investigation or review board on the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=633.0s)]
*  Wouldn't be good to apply, but I'm learning here into bringing this as a subpoena or side effect. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=647.0s)]
*  Yeah. So what did that move entail? You went back to business school, right? Did you go to MBA? [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=653.0s)]
*  I did. I went to Penn with two little twins that I referred to until at the time they were barely not even two years old. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=659.0s)]
*  So I went to California to Philly. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=668.0s)]
*  Yeah, and we literally we sold everything. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=671.0s)]
*  The black horse, you know, not that excited about it, but came along for the ride, as I was saying. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=675.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=680.0s)]
*  And we put the strollers on the top of the bed and we'll cross country. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=681.0s)]
*  And the next two years, year and a half, two years, was everything was at risk, to be honest. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=685.0s)]
*  Full time student? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=693.0s)]
*  Full time, yeah. I did it the hard way. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=695.0s)]
*  That's probably a recurring thing in my life. I'm a little splattered up. You can do it at some point. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=698.0s)]
*  But I did it the hard way. I quit the job. My wife quit the job. She was a working nurse as well. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=703.0s)]
*  And we were both essentially just living on loans and going full time. I was going full time and she was taking care of the kids initially. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=708.0s)]
*  Yeah. Wow. You have a great wife. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=717.0s)]
*  I would agree. I'm coming up on 30 years now. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=720.0s)]
*  Congratulations. Yeah. So you stick it out, full time at bank, get your MBA and then what? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=723.0s)]
*  Another interesting story and it always goes back to it's never planned, at least for me. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=730.0s)]
*  I looked at banking coming out of business school. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=736.0s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=739.0s)]
*  It seemed like banking would be a good career. Everybody's talking about banking as a place to be. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=740.0s)]
*  I looked at consulting because I got people with MBAs look at consulting as well. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=745.0s)]
*  Interestingly, the opportunities that came to me were banking and consulting. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=750.0s)]
*  Actually, in some cases, I don't want to interview me. The ones that came to me were biotech and pharma. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=755.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=760.0s)]
*  And I ended up in a very small company called Centimort. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=761.0s)]
*  This was still in Philadelphia. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=765.0s)]
*  This was still in the Philadelphia area. So thankfully we didn't have to move again. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=766.0s)]
*  I was happy with that part. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=771.0s)]
*  Centimort had just been acquired by Johnson & Johnson and they were launching a drug, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=774.0s)]
*  it's a biologic that is quite well known now, of course, called Bramikate. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=779.0s)]
*  But at the time it wasn't that well known. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=782.0s)]
*  It was the first indication at the time of Crohn's and drobotropyridates. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=784.0s)]
*  And of course, I had done my diligence of looking at the science. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=788.0s)]
*  But my first week was the eye opener for me that sealed the deal on that I had made the right choice, actually. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=792.0s)]
*  And what would happen in that first week? [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=798.0s)]
*  So as happens in many of these companies, when a drug is approved, it's a big celebration. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=800.0s)]
*  Typically in biotech and pharma, the odds are against drugs getting approved. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=807.0s)]
*  The science is going to be endless so many times. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=811.0s)]
*  It's just a very, very challenging science or business trade. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=813.0s)]
*  With the approval of Bramikate, they got the company together and did a company meeting. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=817.0s)]
*  And as part of that company meeting celebration, which is my first week, by the way, [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=821.0s)]
*  I joined the company with Sister Miracle, a very fortunate. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=826.0s)]
*  There was a woman on stage in her 50s and she was a mom with two kids. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=831.0s)]
*  And they wheeled her onto the stage, but she got out of the wheelchair. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=837.0s)]
*  And her message to the company was, I was in the clinical trial as a patient who was involved. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=842.0s)]
*  I've been taking Bramikate, this infused biologic that you all have developed. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=848.0s)]
*  I can now get up and my walking ability is improving and I can now hold my kids. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=853.0s)]
*  And our message to us was, thank you. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=859.0s)]
*  And as I was sitting on the stage, I had no part of this. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=862.0s)]
*  I didn't develop the drug. This is my first week. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=866.0s)]
*  But to be a part of that industry, a part of that company, a part of that journey, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=869.0s)]
*  being able to say, wow, I could be a part of making such a big difference. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=874.0s)]
*  That's what sealed the deal for me to say, like, wow, if these medicines work, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=878.0s)]
*  the effect size of somebody not being able to walk and then being able to get up and hug their children. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=883.0s)]
*  That's probably the only chance I had. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=889.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. So how long did you stay with Seneca? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=893.0s)]
*  I was at Seneca for seven years. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=898.0s)]
*  What was your role there? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=900.0s)]
*  I was on the marketing commercial side. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=902.0s)]
*  It was great because I could take everything I learned when I was in the hospital, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=904.0s)]
*  all the pharmacy science that I learned, all the conversations with physicians, with patients, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=909.0s)]
*  and then the application of the business aspect of things and then be able to educate folks [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=914.0s)]
*  and be able to also place a therapy like RemiKate in the treatment paradigm. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=918.0s)]
*  That's what I believe biotech and also commercialization is about, the right patient choice, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=924.0s)]
*  the right positioning, and for that matter also the right education on benefits of the rest of these products. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=929.0s)]
*  In those seven years, we launched RemiKate in five different indications. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=935.0s)]
*  Out of its six, rheumatoid arthritis is one, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, psoriasis, psoriasis. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=940.0s)]
*  It was drinking up our vials. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=947.0s)]
*  Literally, it was amazing learning. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=949.0s)]
*  We made a huge difference and we continue doing life cycle management, obviously. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=952.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=957.0s)]
*  So at what point did you start to get the entrepreneurial edge? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=958.0s)]
*  Like you're, you know, Seneca or Johnson & Johnson, you're a pretty established role as an established company [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=963.0s)]
*  doing commercial work for an established product. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=970.0s)]
*  You know, where does this desire to move? [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=973.0s)]
*  Way back to the other side that I'll continue on in biotech come from. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=977.0s)]
*  Yes, sometimes I believe it's just a natural journey. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=983.0s)]
*  For me, Xanar4 led to MediNum, another biologics company. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=986.0s)]
*  Again, MediMeeter is already part of our Sosomika. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=990.0s)]
*  So we were our subsidiary in launching, building out the pipeline and launching traditional drugs. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=993.0s)]
*  But in MediMeeter, I started doing more corporate strategic type of initiatives, including one for Sosomika as well. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=998.0s)]
*  So that's where what I would say good judgment skills became important and more at the higher level. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1004.0s)]
*  These are decisions about franchises and outside, about indication selection. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1011.0s)]
*  But it was still working for governance. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1016.0s)]
*  It takes a long time to go to big companies, various governance meetings. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1024.0s)]
*  And as I develop these skills more, the ability and the courage to say I can do this in a smaller setting became more germane and more attractive. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1025.0s)]
*  So guess what? I moved back to California for a smaller company called Intermeer. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1038.0s)]
*  All the way back, yes. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1042.0s)]
*  In the Bay Area. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1044.0s)]
*  And this was a company that was developing a therapy, a small oligolist, called Espirit, in a disease called idiopathic pulmonary phagocytes. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1046.0s)]
*  And we brought that to approval and launched that drug. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1055.0s)]
*  And that eventually unbroached and fired the company. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1060.0s)]
*  But that company had been working on Espirit in the past. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1063.0s)]
*  One phase three trial had been positive. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1068.0s)]
*  Another one had been negative. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1070.0s)]
*  And when I joined, they were doing the third trial to prove or disprove whether the drug would really work in this population. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1072.0s)]
*  So I was taking significant risks. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1079.0s)]
*  And again, I look back and I said, wow, isn't it great that we brought another therapy to patients and ones that are in need with idiopathic pulmonary phagocytes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1081.0s)]
*  After that, I haven't looked back at no big companies since then. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1090.0s)]
*  After Finia, all small companies, including obviously, you know, since then, Avexis and then now, Mathenia. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1093.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. So tell me about that story. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1100.0s)]
*  How did your, what was your exposure to it? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1103.0s)]
*  Finia, that led you to CEO chair there. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1105.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think in some cases, my journey is quite typical in other cases. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1108.0s)]
*  What I mean by that is that the proving grounds in big companies where skill acquisition happens is quite typical. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1114.0s)]
*  And then the graduation from there, I don't see why graduation at the time, but the graduation from there to smaller companies where then you start expanding your wings and get into the higher roles and more bigger responsibilities is pretty typical. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1122.0s)]
*  And one that I have enjoyed because when I've gone into the smaller companies, I now believe I'm anchored enough and I am courageous enough to make these decisions. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1136.0s)]
*  Right. So when I was at Avexis, we brought another gene therapy to patients called Sultrezva. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1145.0s)]
*  These are kids with spinal muscular atrophy. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1151.0s)]
*  We give them this one type therapy. It's infused as an IV infusion. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1154.0s)]
*  We get it to the tropy after birth. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1158.0s)]
*  And the disease is called floppy baby syndrome. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1160.0s)]
*  It's hard running enough where many, many of these babies cannot really function. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1164.0s)]
*  They never get the ability to start walking in and such in many cases that can actually pass away before the age of two. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1170.0s)]
*  So with it's one protein that's missing, the SMI protein. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1177.0s)]
*  So with the gene therapy, we deliver using a capsid, this missing gene and the gene goes to work and these babies are set with that. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1182.0s)]
*  So being a part of that team where we brought that therapy to that patient community and being able to help those parents and lots of those kids, they have their own careers now. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1191.0s)]
*  It was just it was life saving for them and life changing just to be a part of that team. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1201.0s)]
*  But that's also where I realized this particular technology can be useful in so many other diseases. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1207.0s)]
*  The problem, however, is you cannot get all the different types of genes to make these types of curative benefits with the conventional capsids that are available out there. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1214.0s)]
*  So when I left Ovexys, that company was brought up by Novartis after we got the approval. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1225.0s)]
*  A very good colleague of mine, Ed Mothers, who is a very well known investor with new enterprise associates, NEA, that I've been working with at MedImmune actually way back when, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1231.0s)]
*  he approached me to see what I was doing and I considered lots of different CEO roles. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1243.0s)]
*  But he said, hey, I know a scientific leader who is in the gene therapy space and is trying to start a company. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1247.0s)]
*  That John Manstein is Luke Vandenberg and quite well known. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1255.0s)]
*  He coin vented one of the initial capsids, K89. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1258.0s)]
*  So he introduced the two of us. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1261.0s)]
*  It was a phone call in a lady thing. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1263.0s)]
*  It was supposed to be 30 minutes and we just spent talking into the evening. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1266.0s)]
*  We met in person later that week and he told me what he was trying to do. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1270.0s)]
*  I had never started a small company before, forget it, like a starter. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1275.0s)]
*  But I loved what he was trying to do. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1279.0s)]
*  He was trying to do, it was gene therapy, coming off just seeing what gene therapy could do with the kids' spinal muscular atrophy. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1281.0s)]
*  I was hooked. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1288.0s)]
*  And he was doing exactly what we believe what I believe the limitations of initial capsids were. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1290.0s)]
*  So I took the risk and I said, I'll partner with you. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1296.0s)]
*  Haven't done a startup before ever. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1299.0s)]
*  There's no money around the table right now. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1301.0s)]
*  I understand the science enough to realize, of course, it's got to be a slog as I will call it, just like everything else in science. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1304.0s)]
*  But we connected and we're not five years out of the thing. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1310.0s)]
*  Yeah. All right. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1315.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of several directions we can take. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1316.0s)]
*  All right. So you're sitting around the table and you decide that you're going to get in on this opportunity, this project, if you will. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1319.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1325.0s)]
*  What did you you've never done a startup before? [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1327.0s)]
*  What was like what was job number one for you personally to say, OK, like we're going to make a company out of this. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1330.0s)]
*  I need to ask. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1337.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1340.0s)]
*  With any startup, the first thing is, do you have the money? [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1341.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1344.0s)]
*  And you get the money. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1345.0s)]
*  So I. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1346.0s)]
*  She just do the initial work with six months like work, just figuring out the strategy, figuring out the science, putting the pitches together. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1348.0s)]
*  And there's no pay in that. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1356.0s)]
*  You're on your own. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1358.0s)]
*  Yeah. But you and your wife have been there before. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1359.0s)]
*  She's a business girl. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1363.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1364.0s)]
*  She is a receptive to it this time around. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1365.0s)]
*  She is. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1367.0s)]
*  I love my wife. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1368.0s)]
*  She still she still works at the nurse. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1370.0s)]
*  So she she enjoys the same things that drove me all my life. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1372.0s)]
*  Interactions, knowing that we could be a part of this community. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1377.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1380.0s)]
*  Knowing that we could leave a legacy if it does work out. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1381.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1383.0s)]
*  So that that was the guy that said the anchoring. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1384.0s)]
*  That's the mission. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1387.0s)]
*  That's the motivation. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1388.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1389.0s)]
*  So there's no pay for a few months, but there's the hope, the conviction and the courage to say, well, we could do something here. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1390.0s)]
*  So in those six months is you're writing personal checks to say, I need a few more people to get some work done. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1399.0s)]
*  I need a facility which you start with shared space initially, but then you also need the labs to start. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1407.0s)]
*  So all that was initially in our personal check while we were like to trouble funding for what is called the seed financing. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1414.0s)]
*  Right. Yeah. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1420.0s)]
*  So we started calling on investors. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1421.0s)]
*  I'm again very I'll say fortunate, lucky, blessed. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1423.0s)]
*  But some is just being there at the right time at the right place. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1428.0s)]
*  Sometimes where the prior companies and the successes that we had in bringing therapists to patients also rewarded shareholders and investors. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1431.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1439.0s)]
*  So I had now a partnership that I could call on and say, look, this is what we're trying to do. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1440.0s)]
*  Would you take the meeting? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1445.0s)]
*  Let me walk you through why this particular company wouldn't be able to fit for you. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1446.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1449.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1450.0s)]
*  So we did that and did the seed financing initially and then the series A. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1451.0s)]
*  But those those were those were, you know, hard days to be shareable. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1455.0s)]
*  You said this is five years ago. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1461.0s)]
*  This was 2019. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1463.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1464.0s)]
*  And of course, you and I know also what happened in 2020. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1465.0s)]
*  You know, and that unfortunately, right. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1468.0s)]
*  So our friends at Austin and Bird set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM week. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1470.0s)]
*  The firm's National Health Care and Life Sciences Practice has more than 100 attorneys actively involved in the health care industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1477.0s)]
*  The signature strength of this practice is its ability to master complex representations that draw on the coordinated expertise of its regulatory compliance, public policy, transactional corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, government investigations and litigation practice areas. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1488.0s)]
*  Austin and Bird represents life sciences companies and their partners in corporate stages ranging from private to newly public to well established and in a variety of stages of product development from preclinical to post approval commercial launch. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1511.0s)]
*  Learn more at alston.com and tell them you learned about them on the business of biotech. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1526.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, pandemic aside, I was going to ask your perspective on where we were on this sort of delivery vehicle failure in 2019. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1534.0s)]
*  Like, there's a lot of attention being paid to delivery mechanisms for gene therapies and, you know, how we're navigating them to the right tissues. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1548.0s)]
*  In 2019, what was it sort of, you know, early days for that for exploration of that? Or was it in full swing? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1556.0s)]
*  It was a bit of both in the following ways. Conventional gene therapy was an uptick. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1565.0s)]
*  So, Avexodus was acquired by a big company. There were a few other ones that were acquired by a big company, right? [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1571.0s)]
*  So, there was a belief that conventional capsules would be good enough and it would be copy and paste, very, very decent. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1577.0s)]
*  Yeah, again, biotech is never easy. So, there did be, at the point it was good, but it didn't last long. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1585.0s)]
*  But people realized conventional capsules will not cut it and that developing new capsules would be the solution to that. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1592.0s)]
*  Again, this often happens, including me. I thought developing new capsules would be easy. It was a journey. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1599.0s)]
*  So, again, it takes, you think it can be done in months. Sometimes it takes years. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1607.0s)]
*  You think the first indication you select will be a slam dunk. Sometimes it's not the first indication. It's the second or the third short strike. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1612.0s)]
*  So, to be able to persevere during that time, it happens with every biotech company. Maybe not the first time, maybe the third or the fourth time. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1618.0s)]
*  But this is biotechnological odds, unfortunately, are against drugs getting developed and getting eventually to approval. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1626.0s)]
*  So, those early days was very interesting with the investor dialogues because with some funds, the time horizon just doesn't match with what the company is trying to do and how long the science is going to take to mature. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1632.0s)]
*  Especially when you're in licensing something from academia into industry, we do the experiments, need to find the right indication that patient community deserves. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1647.0s)]
*  And the translational aspect is very different than the research. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1656.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1660.0s)]
*  So, tell me a little bit about your approach to that. What's your risk aversion sort of strategy when you don't necessarily know what the market is going to do? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1661.0s)]
*  Especially in the pandemic. Pandemic years were financially pretty good, at least early. And then everything goes crazy. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1674.0s)]
*  What sort of management approach to that risk has allowed you to persevere to your point? [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1687.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1694.0s)]
*  Yeah. So, I call it accumulation of experiences. As one goes through a career, or maybe life in general as well, one learns a few things about good judgment. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1695.0s)]
*  I believe for a leader and a leadership team in particular, that's one of the best skill sets to have. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1707.0s)]
*  How do you render good judgment? When data can be conflicting about each other, right? It can be scientific data, it can be business data, it can be market economic, it can be the fundraising environment. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1712.0s)]
*  So, triangulating that back again to when I was in the hospital and using the SOVP, so the Synsactive Objective Assessment Finan, is what drives the perseverance and the good data. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1725.0s)]
*  In biotech, it's easier than in my opinion, at least, than in big pharma, where again, the governance bodies can be just more tracked. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1737.0s)]
*  So, we were able to make these calls as we recruited a great team of experts coming in, people from different companies like it abroad. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1746.0s)]
*  Again, the same people that I've worked with before, but I chose not to. And bringing that diversity in thinking and across functions allowed us to take and stride whatever circumstances that were there. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1753.0s)]
*  And that included the pandemic. So yes, from a finance perspective, there was more money flowing in the era, but from an operational perspective, that was really, really challenging. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1764.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1774.0s)]
*  And also for the leadership that still had to deliver during that time. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1775.0s)]
*  So, those things just came with all the prior circumstances that we have been through, that I was in through. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1779.0s)]
*  You can then see pattern recognition. I've seen a movie like this before, but let me make some judgment calls today. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1786.0s)]
*  Let's see how it unfolds and then let's course correct if we need to. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1793.0s)]
*  Those were what saved the day many, many times over. Sometimes it was my experiences, sometimes it was my colleagues' experience, the chief scientific officer, the chief development officer, the chief business officer, the chief medical officer at the board. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1797.0s)]
*  It was the collective that I was saying is always better than the individual. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1808.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1813.0s)]
*  Have you always been really good at maintaining emotional control in the face of challenge and adversity? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1815.0s)]
*  In the older days, yes. Less so in the younger days. Nothing to make it about demographic, but I think anchoring can come with just, and steadiness is the other word I would use in what you're describing. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1821.0s)]
*  It can just come from, again, when you've seen Bob Hui's strike time, and so you can take more things and strike. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1834.0s)]
*  Sometimes it's not just professional experience. It can just be you had a child or somebody in your immediate family or passed away. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1841.0s)]
*  These things also just put things into context and experiment that went bad or somebody at the company. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1851.0s)]
*  You're able to put things much more in context and say, wait a minute, this is what I can control. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1858.0s)]
*  This is what I can control, and honestly getting emotionally distraught about it is not even a consideration. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1863.0s)]
*  But I wouldn't say my younger days I was like that. Like with everybody, we do take things too hard. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1870.0s)]
*  We are an organization, by the way, that is very open to feedback. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1875.0s)]
*  That does take time to develop, meaning we give each other feedback, the way it takes it personally. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1880.0s)]
*  But I believe that actually is really important for developing an organization that continuously learns. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1885.0s)]
*  And that feedback also provides mutual steadiness too. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1891.0s)]
*  So if I am facing a circumstance where perhaps I'm having more difficulty to take it in stride, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1894.0s)]
*  I have a colleague next to me who knows how I'd react in that same circumstance. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1901.0s)]
*  It is going to help me have more of a steady hand in that situation. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1904.0s)]
*  So we look out for each other. And at the end of it all, I do believe people will remember those memories, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1908.0s)]
*  how we went through crisis and celebrations together and how we reacted in the moment. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1914.0s)]
*  So I do believe that's super important. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1919.0s)]
*  Yeah. Give me a sense of who the we is at this point, sure, Fania. What does the company look like? [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1920.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing. We're about 60 people overall. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1925.0s)]
*  60 people. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1928.0s)]
*  The people are hand-picked with the skill set that they bring, the achievements that they've brought in the past, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1929.0s)]
*  and then the cultural aspects of things as well. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1935.0s)]
*  In the leadership team, we have Charlie Albright as our chief scientific officer, very accomplished individual from BMS, etc. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1937.0s)]
*  Laura Richman, our chief development officer. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1945.0s)]
*  She was at University of Penn at the chief therapy program, the executive director there with me at MediMu. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1947.0s)]
*  Marcel X in the middle there. Rami Dao, coincidentally, I went to school with him at Wharton. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1953.0s)]
*  And then we were reunited after about 25 years, again, very accomplished, Lilly, human genome sciences, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1958.0s)]
*  Oxylium, etc. as well. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1964.0s)]
*  And then most recently, I will not be able to disclose the name, but we have just hired a chief medical officer. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1967.0s)]
*  And just about a couple of weeks actually from now. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1973.0s)]
*  And then Rami is the last person, yet, for manufacturing with the antibiotics as well. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1978.0s)]
*  Fantastic. By the time this episode drops, that chief medical officer is likely be known. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1982.0s)]
*  Yeah, congratulations. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1988.0s)]
*  I mean, you highlight the accomplishments of these folks that you put together on the team. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1990.0s)]
*  What was the, you know, tell us about the challenge of putting together, scaling up that leadership team, you know, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=1997.0s)]
*  to align expertise with the mission of the Athenia. Was it tough? [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2004.0s)]
*  It's always tough assembling the right team. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2011.0s)]
*  I would say recruiting was good. I wouldn't call it tough. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2017.0s)]
*  Perhaps because of the various companies that I've been at, it's the same diversity in companies that I was at that expanded my network [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2022.0s)]
*  that also allowed me to approach investors, but also build out the board as well. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2032.0s)]
*  So between the leadership team and the board, we've had exposure to, I don't know what it is, 20 authority companies. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2036.0s)]
*  So you amplify that with the entire network of 20 authority companies. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2044.0s)]
*  You're just able to speak with people, make a phone call, and then get a really good diverse, [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2048.0s)]
*  and start individuals coming into the company, both at the board, the leadership, and also the organization as well. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2053.0s)]
*  The track record, I would say, helps significantly. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2060.0s)]
*  So when I can go in front of folks and say, I've been at Sonocor, Metamune, EtoMune, Avexis, and Starling Athenia, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2063.0s)]
*  they know these companies are fairytale companies in biotech. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2072.0s)]
*  The number of medications that patient communities that got approved with these drugs is, I would say, uncanny. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2075.0s)]
*  We have that many. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2081.0s)]
*  And it's the same thing for the other people that have the pleasure and the privilege of working with side-by-side investment teams. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2082.0s)]
*  So it's been good to be able to record people from that perspective. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2089.0s)]
*  But assembling the team still requires careful thought. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2094.0s)]
*  And then the other thing that I would also say, after you assemble, getting the right dynamic is also really, really important. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2100.0s)]
*  Because the entire 60-ish people that are in the company are relying on the leadership teams for making culture decisions, being alive. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2108.0s)]
*  And we debate things really well, very candid dialogues. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2115.0s)]
*  But when we have made the decision that we want flawless execution, right? [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2119.0s)]
*  So putting a solid shared together that allows the candid dialogue, but then the aligned decision and the execution is not easy work. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2124.0s)]
*  I still look back through my journey in SICK. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2133.0s)]
*  I also lead a sales team as well. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2136.0s)]
*  And being able to pour all the forces towards a common goal is an incredible skill set to have and one that takes time to develop, is all I would say. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2138.0s)]
*  Yeah. What were some of the key... [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2146.0s)]
*  I mean, it's an important point. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2148.0s)]
*  I'm curious about some of the sort of key experiences that have contributed to that skill set. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2149.0s)]
*  Yeah. The word sales can be sometimes misinterpreted. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2155.0s)]
*  In biotech, you have to remember that you are still providing the opportunity for a patient or a family to make a medicine choice that will affect their health. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2160.0s)]
*  So I always call it education. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2170.0s)]
*  Having gone through the sales experience, you set the right expectations of how you want an individual or an individual team to behave. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2174.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2183.0s)]
*  The common goal that he or her or that team has, and then to be able to work side by side with the individual and make sure expectations are met and the common goals are achieved. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2184.0s)]
*  That's both the process and the, what I would say, the dynamic, the setup. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2194.0s)]
*  In the world of commercial, that is quite well-trained and exhibited. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2201.0s)]
*  So being able to bring that into the leadership team and beyond the leadership team, like this is training, it's development, it's all those things. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2207.0s)]
*  And it's also, I use the term followership in a matter in which you have to be able to craft a vision. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2215.0s)]
*  You have to have people, it's a calling. You have to have them believe in that vision. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2222.0s)]
*  And then they're jazzed to go and see if it can make a difference in the world to these people that are counting on you, that you have a technology or medicine that can make a difference in their life. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2227.0s)]
*  So that I think is where magic happens in running a company or running a team or working with people. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2237.0s)]
*  So let's talk a little bit about the magic that Affini is making happen. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2243.0s)]
*  You've got the team, you've got the culture, you're all rowing in the same direction. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2247.0s)]
*  Take us through some recent progress in terms of the technology and therapeutics that you're working on. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2252.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a momentous year, a very transformative year. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2258.0s)]
*  So over the past many months, developing casets that get genetic cargo to the right destination. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2262.0s)]
*  We focused on two tissues, muscle and the central nervous system. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2269.0s)]
*  In muscle, we focus on skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2273.0s)]
*  So we have capsules that get to skeletal muscle in all the diseases that are there for skeletal muscles, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy and others. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2276.0s)]
*  And we have a set of casets that do the same thing for cardiac muscle as well. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2284.0s)]
*  In the cardiac muscle, there's more and more genes that are being identified that explain why people have certain hypotheses. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2289.0s)]
*  And then this can be heart failure, this can be the heart getting larger, hypertropic cardiomyopathy, this can be everything else. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2296.0s)]
*  Yes. So we are focusing for our initial indication and program or lead program, as we call it, on a genetic disease of the heart. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2303.0s)]
*  That gene that is affected is called BAG3. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2311.0s)]
*  The resulting impact on the patient is they have heart failure. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2315.0s)]
*  Now, many people have heart failure, but they shouldn't be getting the heart failure in their 20s and 30s. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2319.0s)]
*  That's what happens to these individuals. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2325.0s)]
*  The BAG3 gene produces this protein called BAG3, which is key to the heart cells beating. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2328.0s)]
*  So imagine if the cell only has half the protein, of course, the heart cell cannot beat and the individual ends up having heart failure. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2335.0s)]
*  With the capsules and the delivery method that we have, we can easily package in this BAG3 gene. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2345.0s)]
*  It's full length, it's fully humid, one dose simple IV infusion. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2351.0s)]
*  And we've shown in animals that the cardiac cells starts beating. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2357.0s)]
*  And the cardiac function is restored back to normal. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2362.0s)]
*  We scaled up those studies to the higher species, the nanometriate studies, as we call it. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2366.0s)]
*  And we've transferred that technology to our manufacturing partner, Forge Biologics. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2372.0s)]
*  And they'll scale it up to the desired scale that it's been done. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2377.0s)]
*  So this year we plan on filing an investigational new drug to the agency. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2381.0s)]
*  We've met with the agency already initially. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2386.0s)]
*  That filing will happen in the fourth quarter of this year. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2388.0s)]
*  And this is a disease where our preclinical data shows us that we can actually get efficacy results very quickly. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2392.0s)]
*  So we hope to come in the first half of next year and to show that what we've seen at the animal studies are actually showing people. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2399.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's pretty wild. That's fantastic. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2406.0s)]
*  I mean, you used the word easily. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2409.0s)]
*  We showed that we could do this easily. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2412.0s)]
*  It seems like you even said, nothing comes easy. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2414.0s)]
*  So how easy really was it? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2418.0s)]
*  That's really what will be in the clinical results for sure. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2420.0s)]
*  We've selected this. I spoke about decision making and diversity of opinion. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2423.0s)]
*  I hope that reflects how much debate we put into selecting this indication. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2428.0s)]
*  The biology of this disease is well blown out with human data. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2433.0s)]
*  So in humans, people have shown that when bag 3 protein levels in the cells are lower, that cell does not meet fast enough, hard enough. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2437.0s)]
*  In humans, people have shown that when the bag 3 is not functioning properly, the people end up having a heart failure. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2446.0s)]
*  And that difference is very pronounced and very quick. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2455.0s)]
*  The animal model that we are using almost identically mirrors the human disease from the genetic defect to the molecular design behind it, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2460.0s)]
*  to the exhibition of the loss of cardiac function and for that reason, the early death. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2469.0s)]
*  Of course, all these patients have a heart transplant. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2476.0s)]
*  Of course, in these animals, they don't do heart transplant. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2478.0s)]
*  So the animals end up virtually dying until we give them this gene therapy. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2481.0s)]
*  And then, as I mentioned, the cardiac function is lost. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2487.0s)]
*  Will it be easy? No. Have we done all the things we could to make sure that we have the U.S. this program? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2490.0s)]
*  Absolutely, yes. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2497.0s)]
*  So I'm super excited about pushing it forward into the clinical trials and showing that what we're seeing in animals will be seen. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2498.0s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2506.0s)]
*  I should, of course, take that into account. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2507.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2509.0s)]
*  What have you found in terms of the investment community's appetite for what Afenia is working on? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2510.0s)]
*  You know, the gene therapy space is one of those ones that's been subject to ebbs and flows, peaks and valleys in terms of investment, general investment. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2516.0s)]
*  Yeah, gene therapy is not regarded as in favor, as I would call it, in vogue. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2526.0s)]
*  Again, there is an event for investor sentiment on these things. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2531.0s)]
*  I would say there is really good segregation between gene therapies that use conventional capsules and gene therapy companies that are developing new delivery methods like us that are capsules that actually solve the issues with conventional capsules. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2534.0s)]
*  The last race that we did was in April 2021. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2548.0s)]
*  Since four years out, since then, which is amazing. That was a serious week. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2552.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2556.0s)]
*  The reason we've been able to continue the company without doing another fundraising until we do one in the near future has been because we have delivered the capsules through a business development deal that we had with Vortex. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2557.0s)]
*  And those have been earning the maximum financial milestones that we could have want. So that's been setting the company financially all those points. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2567.0s)]
*  The receptivity is really good with this indication. There are tens of thousands of patients that are partially affected in the US alone. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2575.0s)]
*  It's a disease where there is no specific disease modifying therapy. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2582.0s)]
*  Even in our dialogues with the FDA, we believe that the data was received as being very compelling. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2587.0s)]
*  And our sentiment from the investors so far has been very encouraging that this is exactly the type of indication that they would like to see where we've shown efficacy, safety, and also in head-to-head studies, differentiation from others might be doing double-edged in this disease. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2593.0s)]
*  So we will look at that. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2608.0s)]
*  Fundraising, if any CEO tells me, by the way, it is a good bucket of fundraising right now. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2610.0s)]
*  It is not. I can just record straight on that. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2615.0s)]
*  I mean, we're in a place right now where the message is mixed, obviously, right? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2618.0s)]
*  People are putting the shiny stuff out there, but it's not necessarily always really shiny. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2623.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2628.0s)]
*  I would say that things that do help is the data speaks for itself. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2629.0s)]
*  And then our prior track record as a leadership team also speaks for itself. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2633.0s)]
*  I think what the dialogue does happen is in the three to four years time frame on Vogue, there was certainly, unfortunately, a lot of hype. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2638.0s)]
*  So the valuations were more likely, like they should have been in retrospect at the time. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2645.0s)]
*  So of course, there will be a reset in just the market as it has been going. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2650.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, it's been passed two or three years. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2654.0s)]
*  Yeah. You mentioned your partnership with Ford Biologics. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2656.0s)]
*  I'm curious about what the plan might look like moving forward. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2660.0s)]
*  I don't want you to make too strong a forward-looking statement, but let's fast forward and say that those tens of thousands of patients who could benefit from this therapy have the opportunity to benefit from this therapy. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2664.0s)]
*  Let's just use those words. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2677.0s)]
*  This is a space where manufacturing and access and distribution have presented challenges historically. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2679.0s)]
*  How do you feel about that environment and its development between now and that point? [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2691.0s)]
*  Do you have reason to believe that there's commercial manufacturing opportunity in a way that is going to create accessibility for patients for therapies like these? [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2698.0s)]
*  Yeah, really quick question. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2714.0s)]
*  So what I didn't mention earlier is one of the other areas that we see significant investment in the technical side is also manufacturing. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2715.0s)]
*  Within our own company on-site, we have a process science development lab that goes all the way to 250 years. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2723.0s)]
*  I mentioned to you that one of the individuals we brought into our company, the head of manufacturing, came from Avastis, where he's done gene therapy manufacturing to a very good level of depth. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2730.0s)]
*  So the new technology that we have developed, which is a proprietary plasmid design that to get a little bit into the technical depth there, allows us to improve our yields by tens times and also improve the quality of the product. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2741.0s)]
*  So we have tech transferred this to Forge Biologics. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2755.0s)]
*  They have replicated the results. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2759.0s)]
*  The results are good, even in their hands, which is, again, really good science. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2761.0s)]
*  And the amount of scale that we are using at Forge Biologics, similar to ours, is much smaller than what other companies might have to use if they did not have this proprietary plasmid design. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2766.0s)]
*  So we are, to give you a really good example, even to go into our phase one, the first in human trial, we will use only a 50 liter scale. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2779.0s)]
*  Good. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2788.0s)]
*  Many companies would use a 250 or a 500 liter scale. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2789.0s)]
*  So that gives us really high confidence on both the ability to have the capacity to provide access to these patients, but also to manage some of the cost of goods sold as well. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2793.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2804.0s)]
*  When you take into account a disease such as back-free diuretic cardiomyopathy and you consider that about a quarter of them unfortunately require heart transplant, the health economic argument for a disease like that and the cost on that individual, that family, and overall society and the peer, the budget, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2805.0s)]
*  I guess they call it, is actually really high. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2822.0s)]
*  Heart transplant is billions of dollars, unfortunately, not to mention the subsequent cost that comes alongside the heart and I mean the individual as well. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2825.0s)]
*  So again, when we select these diseases, we're also very cautious of the societal benefit and ensuring that we have both the benefit risk of a gene therapy, but also strong health economic argument. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2834.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2848.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2849.0s)]
*  What would be an investor's trepidation around like, I mean, if you think about it just at a baseline level, simply fundamentally, we're taking a technology that has shown it's merit, it's demonstrated it's merit. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2850.0s)]
*  There's the potential to take it out of like ultra rare indications where as an investor, your benefit, your payback might be limited into more broad patient populations, broader indications, bigger patient populations. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2867.0s)]
*  And to your point, there's a financial equation that's not going to make it, we won't speculate on what the price tag might be, but certainly competitive to or better than a multi-million dollar heart transplant. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2885.0s)]
*  So what's the concern? [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2901.0s)]
*  What would you say is the biggest concern right now? [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2904.0s)]
*  I would not say the investors have a concern. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2906.0s)]
*  The receptive is really good. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2909.0s)]
*  The back three died in a car accident. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2911.0s)]
*  So as an exemplary instance of where gene therapy is a really good solution to it with the cascids such as ours would get to eliminate 100% of heart cells. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2914.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2923.0s)]
*  Many investors, unfortunately, from the, I'm speaking second hand from the dialogues with that. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2924.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2929.0s)]
*  Myself. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2930.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2931.0s)]
*  But for many investors, unfortunately, the last few years have not been good. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2932.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2934.0s)]
*  So I think for the folks that are in the life science focused industry, because the generalists have benefited from higher interest rates and other areas beyond that I have to accept her. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2935.0s)]
*  So for the ones that are focused on the life science area, they find more comfort with clinical programs, the programs that are already in the clinic and where the readout is in the next six months. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2944.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2957.0s)]
*  In the case of Afinia, the IMD is this year and the readout is in the early part of next year. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2958.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2963.0s)]
*  So that is part of the exciting part is that by the time we do the subsequent financing, it is just around the corner. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2964.0s)]
*  But they're being selective, certainly for more clinical photographs is the main thing. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2969.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2974.0s)]
*  I do believe the way that gene therapy is evolving. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2975.0s)]
*  I think similar to what my logics went through when I was launching Remicade decades ago. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2978.0s)]
*  I believe the receptivity and the perception and the evaluation of a gene therapy will become modality at Duster. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2984.0s)]
*  It's another potential medicine. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2992.0s)]
*  It's another potential patient community. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2994.0s)]
*  It's another potential for an investor to return on investment. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=2997.0s)]
*  The fact that it's a gene therapy is perhaps secondary. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3001.0s)]
*  So they will look at the science. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3005.0s)]
*  They will look both in terms of the human biology for the disease and the preclinical results that have been generated by the company for that disease. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3007.0s)]
*  The diverse with the agency, the FDA, and then make a decision on whether that is something that fits into their strategic fund that they are putting in mind that they're the follow up. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3014.0s)]
*  Yeah, interesting. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3023.0s)]
*  What's been on your agenda here this week? [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3025.0s)]
*  So I'd say about a good half meetings are business development meetings, just big companies that like our technology. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3030.0s)]
*  They also like our programs pipeline as well and are curious about what we're willing to license for that. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3039.0s)]
*  And then the other half are primarily investor meetings. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3044.0s)]
*  I guess we, as I mentioned, it's been four years since we made the last round. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3047.0s)]
*  We've been producing some great progress and we wish to press religious without. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3051.0s)]
*  So there are some involved interests in would like to hear more about you when are you doing your next fundraise, you know, might access to a speak now. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3055.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3063.0s)]
*  And then some are such as yourself. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3064.0s)]
*  So being able to speak to yourself and just spread the word out and also share the leadership. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3066.0s)]
*  Charming has been also a nice. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3072.0s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly has. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3074.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a great story. [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3075.0s)]

*  We'll be paying close attention. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3081.0s)]
*  So you've got some pretty big selection points coming up here in the next year or so. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3082.0s)]
*  So hopefully you'll be willing to come back on the show and there's some data to share and progress to share. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3087.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3093.0s)]
*  But I've appreciated the time. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yO6C2bWKfUA&t=3094.0s)]
