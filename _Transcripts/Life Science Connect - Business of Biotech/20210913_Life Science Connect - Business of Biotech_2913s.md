Video Description: The biologic therapy market is crowded, and judging by the recent parade of IPOs, competition for investment, mindshare, talent, and ultimately share of market is only getting stiffer. On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, our friend and biotech business guru Allan Shaw joins us for a foundational conversation on creating competitive differentiation at every stage of biopharma growth. We cover the connections between developmental strategy and the competitive commercial landscape, the moral obligation to differentiate between promise and plausibility, the commoditization of brilliant science, and the necessity to align balanced plans with wild dreams.

# Creating Competitive Differentiation With Allan Shaw
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 13, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI)
*  If you've been listening to the Business of Biotype podcast for a while now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=0.0s)]
*  you'll recall that Erin Harris has joined me to co-host a few episodes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=3.44s)]
*  Erin's my friend, colleague, and chief editor over at sellandgene.com, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=7.2s)]
*  and she just recently launched a podcast of her own. It's aptly named Sell and Gene, the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And if you're working in the Sell and Gene space, you should give it a listen. It's a collection of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=17.04s)]
*  interviews with the industry and academic leaders moving the space forward. And you can find it at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=21.2s)]
*  sellandgene.com or anywhere you listen to podcasts. Sell and Gene, the podcast. Check it out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=25.68s)]
*  So today on the Business of Biotech, my guest needs no introduction because he's a regular [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=40.0s)]
*  around here. When Ellen Shaw walks into a room full of biotech execs, it's akin to Norm Peterson [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=44.64s)]
*  walking into Cheers. Ellen, it looks like the summer's treating you pretty well. Thanks for [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=50.16s)]
*  joining me. Thanks, Matt. Always great to get together, particularly in the summertime. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=55.44s)]
*  Good time for everything. It looks like you got a little sun over the weekend. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=62.08s)]
*  It rained a lot here, so I would distill it to that. I bet I got a lot of sun yesterday. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=68.08s)]
*  Yeah. It was a good day for that, for sure. Absolutely. I mean, Mother Nature's been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=74.4s)]
*  playing funny games on us with the rain on Memorial Day weekend and now the rain on July 4th weekend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=79.92s)]
*  It's probably time to cancel your plans for Labor Day. That would be a proactive, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=86.08s)]
*  probably wise move. On today's episode, we're going to tap into your wisdom on a topic that [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=92.72s)]
*  every new biotech leader should be concerned about on many levels, competitive differentiation. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=97.76s)]
*  You know, you look at competition in this industry and you can just kind of define it on so many [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=106.0s)]
*  levels. There's therapeutic competition where multiple companies are working on very similar [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=112.88s)]
*  biologic entities. There's market competition where any number of biopharma companies are working [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=118.08s)]
*  on any variety of therapies to address a common indication. There's talent competition marked by [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=124.0s)]
*  cut throat and incestuous nature of attaining and retaining talent. There's competition for funding. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=130.72s)]
*  While there's a lot of funding, there's also a lot of hands outreaching for it. There's competition [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=137.28s)]
*  for attention in the press, even competition for the attention of increasingly resource-constrained [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=143.2s)]
*  regulatory agencies. So, Alan, I just rattled off a whole bunch of different, I guess, entry points [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=149.2s)]
*  into this discussion. I don't know whether you want to pick one or whether you want to kind of [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=155.44s)]
*  readjust my frame and tell me what does competition look like from your perspective? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=161.6s)]
*  It's a deep question and you did a really nice job of trying to kind of call out the different [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=170.56s)]
*  considerations or the different elements or work streams or pieces that one gets evaluated on. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=176.16s)]
*  And particularly, I think it's even more complicated these days given the proliferation [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=182.88s)]
*  of companies that we've seen and the formation of companies. It's just been an incredible [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  parade and that's evidenced by the IPOs, which are, you know, every day is breaking another record. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=193.36s)]
*  So with that said, I would say that there's probably a couple of tenants that I would offer [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=200.4s)]
*  up to kind of set a little bit of a backdrop as we try to drill into this a little bit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=205.84s)]
*  I would certainly start off with that first and foremost time is the enemy and the opportunity is [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=212.88s)]
*  now. And I generally kind of think about it as the shortest distance between two points is a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=219.12s)]
*  shortcut, given that. You know, you got to look out beyond your four walls and figure out the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  easiest way to get done and you need to understand what your strengths and what your weaknesses are [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=231.76000000000002s)]
*  and be aware of the threats and opportunities that these all offer to you at the end of the day. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=237.12s)]
*  You know, I've seen some of us, you know, learned about SWAT, but it's a little bit about that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=243.12s)]
*  and really taken a hard intellectual objective look at all these considerations. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=247.6s)]
*  And then there's also the competitive dynamics that there's generally speaking an insatiable [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=256.48s)]
*  demand for innovative assets relative to supply. So, you know, that's actually very powerful [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=260.88s)]
*  because if you can tap into that and position yourself accordingly, you know, you're well on [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=268.48s)]
*  your way. You know, I think there's two general emotions that people respond to, and that's greed [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=274.24s)]
*  and fear. And, you know, you wanted to differentiate the kind of correlate to the greed that this is, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  you know, the best thing since sliced bread. And on the other hand, the fear of missing out on this [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  when you have the opportunity now. So, you know, those would be a couple of the general tenants. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  And then, you know, going further peeling the onion a little bit, I would put and putting [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=298.88s)]
*  fundamental considerations aside, critical fundamental considerations such as the science [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=304.96s)]
*  and most importantly, data, I would put focus and emphasis on human resources, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  development and regulatory strategy, commercial considerations and strategy around that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=315.84s)]
*  I would then kind of turn that focus further down on low hanging fruit and opportunities for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=323.67999999999995s)]
*  differentiation based upon that. Again, putting the science and the fundamentals aside, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=330.32s)]
*  you know, I think it really human resources is is fundamental, you know, I would always pick jockey [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  over superior assets and, you know, the jockeys will figure it out at the end of the day. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=344.64000000000004s)]
*  You know, and given the huge capital market run and industry growth, human resources is actually [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=349.76s)]
*  subplanted financial resources as the most significant gating factor for successful [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=356.0s)]
*  execution and value creation. And that is really one of the most underappreciated aspects. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=361.6s)]
*  You know, I haven't checked the prospectus recently, but it should probably be going in [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  there now that we may not have the ability to attract the talent that we need to be successful [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=376.47999999999996s)]
*  and execute. You know, it is a scarce resource, and it's pressing and it's pressing the need for [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=380.8s)]
*  experienced leadership capable of operating in a changing healthcare environment and creating [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=388.0s)]
*  differentiated strategies necessary for success. You know, if you don't have the if it's getting [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=393.76s)]
*  into a car, if you don't know where you're going, you know, you're never going to get there. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=399.12s)]
*  You know, you need a map, you need a strategy. And if there's obstacles, you need to figure out [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=404.32s)]
*  how to get around that if there's accidents, you know, I guess I guess you need a business ways. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=408.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And a good driver. I mean, that plays with the HR comment that you made. And I [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=414.72s)]
*  think, you know, you mentioned that's an underappreciated asset, I think, especially as [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=419.52s)]
*  it relates to advanced therapies like Cell and Gene. I mean, the conversation that people want [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=423.76s)]
*  to have with us at Bioprocess online and with my colleague, Aaron Harris over at Cell and Gene, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=430.0s)]
*  the conversation that so many people want to have with us now is around HR and the talent crunch and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=434.64s)]
*  the competition for talent, especially as I said, as it relates to those advanced therapies. So I [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  think it is becoming more appreciated in its scarcity. I mean, that would be my reflection. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=447.03999999999996s)]
*  It's becoming more appreciated just how valuable that is as a differentiator, as a different [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=452.0s)]
*  differentiator, because it's so scarce. You know, you've got a lot of experience working with [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=456.48s)]
*  biopharma companies that are in the formative years. What advice do you have around or thoughts [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=463.2s)]
*  do you have around how to build HR in to the secret sauce as a competitive differentiator, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=472.88s)]
*  how to build talent in? I mean, it's a difficult proposition because it's limited. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=480.72s)]
*  Right. No, it is. And it's not just about recruiting folks. It's about retaining folks. You [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=486.32000000000005s)]
*  know, it's probably more costly to lose somebody and retain them. So, you know, you should consider [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=492.24s)]
*  that as you're thinking about, you know, the way of building the right hooks and tentacles. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  And certainly because of demand, you know, I think certainly being aware of the market [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=504.72s)]
*  and what the market dynamics are, because if you're not going to be competitive from a comp, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=510.72s)]
*  from an equity, long-term, short-term perspective, you know, that's a lot to overcome [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=518.08s)]
*  to start with. And then I think there's cultural issues too. And I think even now, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=526.0s)]
*  workforce and what you're focused on is do you need to be in the office or you're not in the [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=530.96s)]
*  office? You know, there seems to be a little bit of a pushback on coming back into the office. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=538.4s)]
*  I think, you know, senior managers and leadership are thinking that maybe that it's better to have [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=545.28s)]
*  people in the office. I don't think people are embracing that. You know, I think they're [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=550.72s)]
*  considering what their options are. So, you know, I think that and what I would call out [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=556.64s)]
*  is hypocrisy because on the board level, the boards are looking at a very much of a hybrid [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=561.68s)]
*  approach. So, you know, if you can't do it at a board level, you know, it all starts with leadership. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=565.84s)]
*  It transcends the culture. And I think culture is going to become an important element to it because [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=571.36s)]
*  people are going to be able to have choices, particularly when you have this supply and demand [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=576.16s)]
*  imbalance. And this situation has become even more acute with, as I mentioned, this proliferation of [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=584.16s)]
*  company formation and the parade of IPOs. As our mutual friend, Rob Wright calls it, it's the [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=591.6s)]
*  boy bands of biotech reflecting this rapid pace of company formation. You know, you try to put [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=597.44s)]
*  your script together and it begs questions. Are you building a company for the market? Are you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=605.36s)]
*  building a company durably or are you building a company just to flip? Right. Well, that brings [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=610.48s)]
*  an important, I guess, an important sort of philosophical point up that I'm curious about [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=615.84s)]
*  your response to. So, you know, you talk about this parade of IPOs and the boy band. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=619.76s)]
*  What does Rob call it? The boy bands of biotech. Yeah. Okay. I love it. Yeah. You know, there's, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=627.2s)]
*  there's, I guess there are two planes we could have this conversation on, right? One being like [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=635.6s)]
*  super, super early. You know, maybe the competitive differentiation is perception. Maybe what you're [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=641.68s)]
*  doing to create competitive differentiation has to do with more with perception than reality, [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=649.12s)]
*  more perception than science or data or meat, right, of the therapeutic. And then later, [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=654.72s)]
*  when there is more established, more established and more close to a product, [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=662.56s)]
*  competitive differentiation takes on a different meaning. It's got a different approach. So [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=671.52s)]
*  hopefully you're following along with what I'm saying here, but like in these early, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=678.24s)]
*  very early stages, like, is there a point where it's maybe too soon to put a stake in the ground [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=681.68s)]
*  or, you know, plant the flag around your competitive differentiator? Is it just, [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=688.24s)]
*  is it just bluster to get some attention? You know, at the beginning, you know, I think it's, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=692.72s)]
*  it's arguably easier because you're selling the dream, you know, so, you know, anything is [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=702.0s)]
*  possible early on. I mean, the question is, is it plausible? And you need to have the plausibility [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=709.6s)]
*  there to be able to stake it out. But I, you know, I don't think there's ever too early to carve out [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=715.84s)]
*  your, you know, your vision. I mean, look, look, protein degradation, for instance, right? That, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=721.52s)]
*  that, that was a, that was a, I mean, it was a plausible theory, but it was, it's just now [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=728.0s)]
*  starting to really be validated with real human data. So, you know, it's, it's, it's, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=733.52s)]
*  um, but you need to have a credible story around it, you know, and I think that's then gets into, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=739.92s)]
*  you know, once you have your vision, how, how are you developing it? How are you de-risking it? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=747.68s)]
*  You know, and that, that one, I think really separates the, you know, the, you know, the, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=753.1999999999999s)]
*  the strength, the strength, strength, you know, that's Darwinism, you know, separating the weak from [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=760.24s)]
*  the, um, the strong, you know, you, and, and I think the development, developmental strategy [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=764.8s)]
*  is really joined at the hip with commercial, you know, you need to understand something that's [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=771.5999999999999s)]
*  relevant, right? There's so many times when you talk to young companies where they're developing [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=776.9599999999999s)]
*  something that's very interesting, but where does this fit at the end of the day, you know? And I [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=782.56s)]
*  think you need to be mindful of the very competitive landscape because this informs, you know, what, [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=788.4s)]
*  what's relevant and what isn't relevant. And then the other thing is, and I think you look and look [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=795.1999999999999s)]
*  at the checkpoints, right? There's an increasing prevalence of clustering of innovative activities [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=800.4s)]
*  around common targets and reflecting capital inefficiency. And unfortunately with 14 approved [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=805.84s)]
*  checkpoints now, I can't, I don't have enough fingers to count them anymore and going, you know, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=813.68s)]
*  they've actually are commoditizing brilliant science. So, which is good for patients in fact, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=819.68s)]
*  but you know, as for the business of biotech, you know, you're cannibalizing really, really good [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=825.5999999999999s)]
*  science. It does create business opportunities on the combination because it's really going to be [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=830.56s)]
*  the combination at the end of the day that's going to grow those, the, you know, huge, huge market. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=835.3599999999999s)]
*  So I would really say that that getting your arms around that also really has this huge impact on [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=841.52s)]
*  resource allocation and focusing on what moves the chains versus what's not going to move the chains. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=851.2s)]
*  And it get like getting back into the analogy of the map, you know, I think, you know, too many [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=859.28s)]
*  times people kick off the fact that you need a target product profile, you know, you need to [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=864.16s)]
*  understand what you're developing. You need to know what you're rowing towards. And a lot of times [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=870.24s)]
*  without that, it's really hard to develop, you know, what are you trying, what are the questions [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=875.12s)]
*  that you need to answer, right? You know, you can do it later on, but you haven't done the work to [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=879.92s)]
*  be able to answer those questions. And then we haven't even touched about, you know, now that [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=885.04s)]
*  the value proposition isn't only just about the clinical data, it's also about the economic data, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=890.3199999999999s)]
*  right? You know, it's the whole body of work. So there's a lot of different elements that go in [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=895.76s)]
*  this. That's why I think it's almost easier at the beginning to selling the vision in the dream, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=900.8s)]
*  but you need to have a plan. Yeah, yeah. But I'm still hung up though, on this, on this concept of [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=905.68s)]
*  like, you're right, you're selling, I understand what you're saying. Early on, you sell the dream. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=912.96s)]
*  But we've seen, I mean, we've seen examples of companies who've sort of taken that too far, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=919.84s)]
*  too early, right? Like the wild claims about, you know, too far in advance of proven data or [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=924.72s)]
*  blatant spin, inflation of data, at least I see it. And perhaps, perhaps that's a, you know, a result [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=932.24s)]
*  of the seat that I sit in, right? I mean, anybody who is an editor of a trade publication in the space [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=938.24s)]
*  is exposed to the PR and IR machine. Perhaps sometimes that machine is a little bit [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=945.28s)]
*  over revved. What's your advice though, for companies to safeguard from taking those [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=955.4399999999999s)]
*  flyers, right? Like making those stretches too soon, too early. At the same time acknowledging [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=963.76s)]
*  that, you know, you've got to maintain the momentum and the energy and the morale. I get that, but [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=969.4399999999999s)]
*  how do you keep it from going too far? That's a great question, really is. And it really cuts [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=974.4s)]
*  to the heart of it because it's all about balance. And you need to find the right balance, you know, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=979.36s)]
*  you need to answer questions, you know, why does somebody want to invest in us? Why should anyone [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=990.24s)]
*  care about us? And then the other thing you need to answer is why now? Why can't I just come back [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=995.12s)]
*  to you in a year? So there's some real tensions in the whole dialogue on what you need to do. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=999.92s)]
*  And at the end of the day, you know, your credibility is priceless, right? You can't [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1007.8399999999999s)]
*  put a price tag on that and you can't buy it back. And that's important. And I would generally [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1013.68s)]
*  suggest don't get too much in front of your skis. You know, if you do, it generally winds up, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1019.28s)]
*  but generally not a good outcome. You know, life is simply too short. And it's almost impossible [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1024.96s)]
*  to replace and remediate credibility once it's lost. So, you know, I think you got to have a [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1034.08s)]
*  moral compass. I mean, not to say that people are immoral, but I think you got to understand, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1040.24s)]
*  you know, the boundaries of gray and navigate. I mean, life is about navigating gray and this [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1044.8s)]
*  is no different than that at the end of the day. You know, I think there's a lot of hypothesis out [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1052.0s)]
*  there and there's a lot of hypothesis on hypothesis. And I think that there's ways you can ground that [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1057.76s)]
*  out and validate that, you know, regular meetings with the FDA provides credibility in terms of your [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1063.84s)]
*  timelines, your feedback, how you're designing your studies. I think, you know, being able to [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1070.4s)]
*  articulate why you're doing studies and running the killer experiments and that you're using the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1077.84s)]
*  right animal essays. Because at the end of the day, how many times do we see tests that work [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1082.56s)]
*  wonderful in the pre-clinic and animals that don't translate? So it's about using the right studies [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1087.84s)]
*  and answering the right questions. A lot of times people keep these things going because they don't [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1094.48s)]
*  want to know the answers. You know, if they have the answers, they are out of a job. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1099.28s)]
*  Right, right. Sure. Like that's the point I'm making. Like if you've got these companies that, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1104.08s)]
*  you know, perhaps you talk about credibility. I can point to a whole host of incredibly credible [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1108.3999999999999s)]
*  fundraisers, but at some point that credibility has to parlay from our ability to keep the company [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1115.6799999999998s)]
*  moving from an economic standpoint to having a leg to stand on from a therapeutic development [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1121.28s)]
*  standpoint. Right? No, you're absolutely right. You know, ultimately, you know, you can package [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1129.84s)]
*  yourself, you can dance, you can sing, you know, you can promise people cures, but at the end of [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1135.76s)]
*  the day, there's no getting around it. You know, show us the data, show me the data. Right. And, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1141.6799999999998s)]
*  you know, there's a great quote from, uh, Edwards Deming, and it's this, in God we trust, all others [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1147.12s)]
*  must bring data. I've heard that before and I like it. I like that. Yeah. Uh, so, you know, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1155.6s)]
*  I think, I think you got to ground it out and, you know, get grounded out differently. There's [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1164.0s)]
*  different ways of validation too. Right. You know, um, you know, jockeys going back to jockeys, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1168.8s)]
*  people who've done it, seen it, that helps validate things. I mean, you can look at people's [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1175.4399999999998s)]
*  success in the capital markets and raising capital, generally the ones that have, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1180.64s)]
*  have, do it successfully have done it multiple times. You know, there's trust, they've made [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1184.8000000000002s)]
*  money for people and, and, and that's not inconsequential. So, you know, getting a rock star, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1190.0s)]
*  getting someone who's seen it done it before, you know, that those, those are, um, are, are, are, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  are fundamental institutions, uh, in your cap table provide credibility. You know, you have the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1201.92s)]
*  fundamental investors, you know, that's what we're seeing right now with the boy bands, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1209.2s)]
*  you know, uh, the parade out there and these things become somewhat self-fulfilling, um, in, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1213.6000000000001s)]
*  in many, in many respects. Um, so there's a little bit of a lemming mentality that [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1220.0s)]
*  follows suit on that, but that, that, that is a competitive advantage. If you've got those folks [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1225.28s)]
*  in your cap table, you're going to have a lower cost of capital. You're going to have easier access [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1230.24s)]
*  to capital. Uh, there's no, no, no question about it. And that transcends to the validation [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1234.56s)]
*  of your science because there's a presumption that these guys have kicked the tires and they bought [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1240.6399999999999s)]
*  into it. Uh, so that those, those are all pieces of the equation at the end of the day that, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1245.84s)]
*  you know, that grounds it out. I mean, look at Moderna. I mean, I, I think there was nothing [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1252.56s)]
*  shy about the way Moderna approached their existence. They, they would demonstrative as [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1257.44s)]
*  a private company and they've been able to back that up to date. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1262.4s)]
*  Yeah. You, you, uh, you talked about, there's maybe some more nuance to your references around, [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1268.16s)]
*  you know, your capital partnerships, uh, being more, more nuanced examples of, uh, creating [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1274.88s)]
*  competitive differentiation. And you referenced earlier, you know, the, the crowded, uh, checkpoints [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1279.92s)]
*  landscape. Um, what, what, what's your advice to companies that are in a, in a space like that, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1286.3999999999999s)]
*  that's, uh, that's, that's a bit crowded, whether it's crowded therapeutically or crowded from an [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1291.36s)]
*  indication standpoint. Um, what, what are, what, what are your opinions around sort of creating [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1298.08s)]
*  some more nuanced, uh, value propositions or competitive differentiators that is where, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1304.1599999999999s)]
*  you know, there, there appear to be a whole bunch of me, me too companies, you know, what, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1310.3999999999999s)]
*  what can I do? Is it, you know, part, you know, perhaps partnership is a good example. You [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1314.96s)]
*  mentioned partnership earlier, there's competitive differentiation perhaps in who you associate [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1318.8s)]
*  yourself with, who you align with from a combination standpoint, uh, who you choose as a partner. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1323.68s)]
*  What other examples are, are there out there for, for that kind of differentiation? [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1330.88s)]
*  No, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a, it's a fantastic question and, and it really speaks to [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1335.52s)]
*  where I think a lot of people are, right? Look at all the different TNF inhibitors, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1340.96s)]
*  look at the checkpoints. Uh, some knowingly were fast followers and others just, you know, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1344.96s)]
*  going back to Lemmings and people thinking that you need to have that in order to reduce your [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1351.44s)]
*  costs for combinations. So it depends on your, your relative strategies around that. But to your [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1356.16s)]
*  point, you know, you, I think you need to develop strategies around, uh, I guess this all actually, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1360.96s)]
*  let's take it a step back, really provides an opportunity if you view it as an opportunity, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1366.8s)]
*  as opposed to a challenge. And I think areas that can allow you to have a market advantage [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1371.84s)]
*  right in your face. And it's really how you think about it, you know, developing strategies [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1377.52s)]
*  surrounding clinical, you know, to your point, you know, some of these things are very, uh, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1382.24s)]
*  costly intensive. So you may want to partner around somebody to be able to scale them up and [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1386.32s)]
*  to be able to answer different questions and to be able to open the market up a little bit. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1391.36s)]
*  So that, that's certainly an approach. You can also go for areas that people haven't been to [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1397.12s)]
*  before. That's been time tested. You know, when you look at the different indications, you know, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1401.6s)]
*  whether it's Regeneron or whoever else who's been later to the party, they've picked indications [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1406.1599999999999s)]
*  that allow them to get to the market quicker. And it's kind of, um, akin to, um, you know, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1411.36s)]
*  what Phil Needleman, uh, said in his 10 commandments of drug R and D, find the shortest [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1418.96s)]
*  route to heaven, you know, figure out how you get your drug out there. Don't spend 80,000 years [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1424.88s)]
*  doing discovery experiments, do the ones that you need to do and, uh, and then quickly bring the [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1430.72s)]
*  drug to market. Then you open it up and you figure out different areas to, um, I wouldn't call [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1437.04s)]
*  exploit, but to, to serve patients needs and see where the opportunities are. Um, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1442.56s)]
*  additionally, I would say besides the clinic, I think there's, um, commercial strategies that [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1448.32s)]
*  you can take regulatory strategies you can take in terms of, again, bringing things to market, [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1455.04s)]
*  uh, quicker and look for opportunities to differentiate yourself, you know, whether or [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1460.16s)]
*  not it's a fast track status or whatever the approach might be. And again, those, those going [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1465.52s)]
*  back to Phil Needleman, you know, those smaller indications, you know, you may be able to do this [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1471.52s)]
*  with a phase two registration study too. So there's again, different approaches to, um, uh, to [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1475.84s)]
*  deal with what I would call, you know, as you call those nuances. Um, but I think it's really [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1483.92s)]
*  also staying focused on your core expertise, right? You know, what, what got you there? What [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1490.24s)]
*  are you good at? And are you better at this than other people? And is there an angle there? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1495.6s)]
*  You know, I think that that's really important in terms of being able to leverage that therapeutic [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1500.32s)]
*  footprint and to be able to maximize the asset value. Cause really knowing where you're good at [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1505.6s)]
*  also, you know, by definition, let's see identify where you're not so good at. And you can identify [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1511.12s)]
*  the gaps to be able to leverage the vast ecosystem. You know, it doesn't have to be made here. You [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1516.3999999999999s)]
*  don't have to recreate the wheel. You know, going back to my earlier comment, you know, the shortest [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1522.8s)]
*  distance between two points is a shortcut collaborate, collaborate and collaborate whenever [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1527.6s)]
*  possible. Yeah. Yeah. You, uh, you've, you brought up an interesting point around regular, the, you [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1532.6399999999999s)]
*  know, the, the, the, the regulatory landscape and a, and a strategic means of leveraging the regulatory [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1538.8s)]
*  space as a competitive differentiator. And I guess I hadn't thought of it in that respect. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1544.9599999999998s)]
*  The, the FDA does give you avenues. I mean, they, they, they create avenues to, uh, to, to kind of [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1551.76s)]
*  take, take the shortcut if, if you will. I know that that's probably a bad word to use. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1558.48s)]
*  Yeah. I'm probably should drop using that after today. Yeah. Yeah. In the context of FDA, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1562.96s)]
*  not a good idea to use that, but in the context of, of how you're using it, uh, those avenues, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1567.92s)]
*  are there. Um, how do you know, how do you know when it's appropriate, uh, to, to kind of choose [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1574.3999999999999s)]
*  one of those paths? Any thoughts on that? Like, you know, when do we say, Hey, I mean, we need to [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1580.32s)]
*  seek this, uh, avenue that the FDA provides. And, and, and the other question that occurs to me is, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1584.96s)]
*  how do you know that, uh, that it is truly a differentiator if you, if you go down one of [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1591.84s)]
*  these paths, is it, is there a, a, you know, a source where I can kind of look and say, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1596.08s)]
*  well, if, if I, if I take this, if I chart this course with, with FDA, I know that I'm, I'm not [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1600.72s)]
*  the fourth company in my space to do it. Maybe I'm the first. I don't know. Is there, is there a, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1606.64s)]
*  is there a resource to know that? Um, all, all, all fair points, you know, um, you know, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1612.16s)]
*  what the FDA does for other companies is generally, you know, if they give them a [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1620.8000000000002s)]
*  fast track designation, I believe that's in the domain, but I think I would back back up [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1625.92s)]
*  and think about who you need to be, you know, in your foxhole, you know, who do you, what are [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1630.96s)]
*  the resources you need on your table? And, uh, you know, I think to go through drug development [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1637.36s)]
*  without having a regulatory resource as part of your, your think tank in terms of your, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1641.9199999999998s)]
*  the way you're approaching drug development, I think you're missing a critical element to that. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1648.56s)]
*  You know, people know what they know and they don't know what they don't know. And, and, and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1654.0s)]
*  I think being, having somebody plugged in on a regulatory side, again, I don't think all [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1658.4s)]
*  regulatory advisors are created equal. You know, I prefer to take advice from people who've actually [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1664.24s)]
*  been involved with getting drugs approved before, uh, and have a resume behind all of that. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1669.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, I don't want somebody learning on my, on my watch. Uh, and when you see hypothesis on [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1675.52s)]
*  hypothesis and you hear people pontificating about timelines that make no plausible sense, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1681.68s)]
*  you know, and, and it's, it just reveals that they're not conferring with people. So I think [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1688.0800000000002s)]
*  it's part of drug development. You need to understand what are your, what are your dials [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1694.3200000000002s)]
*  that you have at a regulatory perspective? And it comes back to time to market and, and speed. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1698.72s)]
*  And there's benchmarks out there too, I think responsive to your question too, [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1705.52s)]
*  that actually demonstrates the value of this. You know, you have these, um, um, um, vouchers [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1710.16s)]
*  you know, the, um, that you get if you, you know, if it's a pediatric drug, um, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1717.76s)]
*  and they, and there's, then they get traded, you know, and they've been traded for over a hundred [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1724.72s)]
*  money, big dollars. So, you know, there's real, I mean, that, that quantifies the, the, uh, the speed, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1729.76s)]
*  the speed to market valuation and what people are going to pay for, particularly when you get into a [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1737.04s)]
*  space race, as you allude to, right? I mean, we saw numbers when, when it turned out that product [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1742.72s)]
*  has been a problem to date, at least in the form of an antibody, uh, but you know, the PCK9 drugs, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1748.32s)]
*  right? Uh, you know, I believe if I got it right, I think Amgen paid a small fortune to get a, a, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1754.8s)]
*  a voucher, priority review voucher to be able to bring it to market. So, you know, there's [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1761.52s)]
*  numerous, uh, numerous examples of that. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1767.3600000000001s)]
*  The business of biotech is brought to you in partnership with Cytiva. Together, we're committed [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1769.76s)]

*  to the clinic and beyond. Check out a host of useful resources for biotech leaders at Cytiva's [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1787.12s)]
*  emerging biotech accelerator at Cytiva life sciences.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1793.6s)]

*  Your point about, uh, who's in your foxhole, the regulatory thing. And I know this goes back to, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1810.9599999999998s)]
*  to HR as a, as a differentiator and talent as a differentiator, but I'm curious about this. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1815.52s)]
*  And I think other people would be too. Um, you know, I've never worked in a, in a bi, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1820.88s)]
*  biopharma company. I've never, you know, been in the C suite of a, of a biopharma company and [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1825.5200000000002s)]
*  worked with, you know, a chief financial officer and a chief, you know, chief of regulatory affairs [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1830.0800000000002s)]
*  and a chief medical officer and so on and so forth. Um, from your perspective, when you [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1835.5200000000002s)]
*  assemble that team, uh, and, and we know you want the, you know, you, you want folks who have been [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1842.72s)]
*  there and done that, who have traveled that path before, but when you assemble that team, is it [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1848.56s)]
*  assumed that each of those roles will come in to the organization knowing full well that they're [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1853.04s)]
*  not just there to, you know, do the medicine as a CMO or do the regular, you know, travel the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1859.9199999999998s)]
*  regulatory framework as a, as a chief regulatory officer, um, or build, you know, the, the facility [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1866.24s)]
*  or the, the manufacturing scheme as a chief technology officer, is it assumed that when [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1874.32s)]
*  they come in, they, they recognize that their role includes that of chief differentiator within [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1878.3999999999999s)]
*  the context of their job, or is that trained or is that, you know, part of the culture that you have [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  to build? I'm just curious, like it, because, you know, I've never, I've never been there, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1889.12s)]
*  but I wonder how many of those folks come into the role recognizing that there's an expectation as a [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1894.72s)]
*  growing company that you play a role in this differentiation effort, a palpable role. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1899.6s)]
*  It's, it's a provocative question, you know, it's not one that I've actually thought about, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1910.32s)]
*  you know, does this person get it? Yeah, well, I mean, I feel like it's legitimate because, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1916.56s)]
*  you know, the other part of the conversation, I mean, to just add context to the question, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1921.52s)]
*  I spend a lot of time talking with, with, with execs who are hung up on the, you know, the, [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1925.44s)]
*  the translation from academia to commercial, not just in terms of science and medicine, but in [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1930.64s)]
*  terms of people, right? Like I don't, I wouldn't, I certainly wouldn't make the assumption that, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1937.76s)]
*  you know, a recent MD graduate coming, coming out of, out of school is going to step into a [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1943.76s)]
*  biopharmaceutical role, knowing full well that there's an expectation that they contribute [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1950.72s)]
*  in a tangible way to the competitive differentiation of the company. Maybe the veterans [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1955.68s)]
*  have been grizzled to know that, but. I think that's probably, I think you kind of may have [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1960.56s)]
*  answered the question a little bit with what you just said. I think it's a, it depends. And I think, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1965.76s)]
*  you know, the less experience, there's no substitute for experience. And, you know, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1972.32s)]
*  I, like I said, I never considered whether people actually thought about it, but as I reflect on [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1977.04s)]
*  this, you know, the people who, who've been in, who've seen it, done it, they're much more [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1983.68s)]
*  attuned to what it takes to be successful. And typically, typically you could be successful. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1989.6s)]
*  You need to be differentiated, but I'd also point out that, you know, big farmers survived and was [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=1998.08s)]
*  survived very handsomely without having to be different. Right. You know, you got numerous [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2005.44s)]
*  TNF drugs out there. You know, you, we do have a lot of fast followers. And I think that's going to [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2011.92s)]
*  be, I think that that has worked in the past because we've had a tolerant healthcare system [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2018.96s)]
*  that allowed it to work. I think as, as the aging population gets older, I think there's a breaking [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2026.3200000000002s)]
*  point in terms of what we can support from a healthcare perspective. So I have a personal view [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2034.16s)]
*  is that, you know, drug pricing is going to fall into two camps, you know, for me to products, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2040.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, even if, even if there's IP on it, it's going to still be coming down to like you see in [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2046.16s)]
*  Europe with reference pricing, and it's going to be, you know, branded generics for all intents [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2051.36s)]
*  and purposes, things that are novel, things that are innovative, that's going to, that's going to [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2058.0s)]
*  continue to get premium pricing. And that that's part of this, the machine that we have, you need [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2063.6s)]
*  that to happen in order to be able to inspire the entrepreneurial and competitivism. And when you look [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2069.36s)]
*  abroad, you know, the, the ecosystems are not what we have here. And that's something that's actually [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2076.4s)]
*  working. So for all the things you can pick at and complain about, you know, we are promoting [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2082.0s)]
*  innovation right now. And you got to be careful that you don't do anything to to hurt that. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2087.44s)]
*  Right. Yeah. Ampere that effort. Yeah. I want to get your perspective on stakeholders and getting [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2094.8s)]
*  their attention as it as it relates to communicating your competitive differentiators. And there are [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2103.2000000000003s)]
*  some obvious ones, right? I mean, early in the game, when we're looking for for venture capital, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2108.96s)]
*  when we're pitching investors, you know, we've actually recorded episodes on that, Alan, you [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2114.88s)]
*  know, very specific to how to go out there and raise funds as a brand new entity. And that speaks [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2122.0s)]
*  to this, you know, you've got to have a competitive differentiator to establish the differences [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2128.4s)]
*  between your company and myriad others of those, you know, pre even pre boy band, right, like the [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2134.7200000000003s)]
*  prepubescent boy band players that haven't even made it that far yet. But who are some of the [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2140.08s)]
*  other I guess, one, who else is is is part of the audience that you want to differentiate [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2146.64s)]
*  differentiate yourself in front of and what are some good approaches to communicating that [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2152.08s)]
*  differentiation? You know, I think you first have to start out with who are you communicating to, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2156.48s)]
*  right? Because the messages can be different, too. And, you know, I'm not sure always when [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2163.04s)]
*  size fits all, you'd like to make them be one size fits all. But I think you got to be mindful [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2168.0s)]
*  of that, you know, you're going from institutional investors, you're going from retail investors, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2174.96s)]
*  are you going to industry people and medical affairs? So you got to really understand [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2178.96s)]
*  what what what what your audience is. And then I think you need to also, you know, develop [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2184.56s)]
*  key messages that incorporates all forms of communication, like shareholders, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2191.12s)]
*  letters, investor, corporate presentations, the website, social media, public relations, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2196.56s)]
*  interviews. And it's important to really stay on those messages. And those messages need to be, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2202.64s)]
*  you know, constantly, you know, reviewed and updated. But you know, it's important, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2207.68s)]
*  you know, even if somebody asks you a question that's that you don't like, you know, you got to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2213.36s)]
*  respond with your message. And if your message is I love my mommy, they say, you know, why did you [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2217.92s)]
*  have such a bad quarter? I love my mommy. It just has to be the ultimate response at the end of the [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2222.32s)]
*  day. And you got to stay on point. And I think you also got to be mindful of the fact, at least from [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2227.92s)]
*  my experience, that people generally do a very horrible job of listening. I think listening is [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2232.88s)]
*  one of the most underappreciated art forms. And you know, if you're not listening, it's really makes [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2238.32s)]
*  it hard for them to retain the information. So it's important to be redundant, and always on [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2244.48s)]
*  message like I said, you know, it's it's like detailing, it's about reaching frequency. And, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2250.48s)]
*  you know, I find you got to say it at the beginning, you got to say it at the middle, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2258.16s)]
*  and you got to say it at the end. And they're only going to remember 20% of it anyway, which is the [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2262.16s)]
*  frustrating thing. But at least you're keeping it on point, keeping it there. And I think that helps [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2267.44s)]
*  in terms of the communication, but it comes back to data, you know, you can come up with a great [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2275.2s)]
*  story, you can impress them. But again, you got to answer why now? You know, why are you relevant? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2280.16s)]
*  And I think being relevant, and thinking of ways to remain relevant, are equally important. And it [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2287.12s)]
*  could be around competitive landscape, it can be around certain particular conferences and events. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2294.3999999999996s)]
*  But you know, I kid that if you want to get hit by a car, you have to be in traffic. So you know, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2300.56s)]
*  you do need to be out there a little bit. And be mindful that there's no silver bullet. And it's [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2305.36s)]
*  really just a lot of tactical error things that you need to do and continually to do it [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2312.88s)]
*  at the end of the day and then success breeds success. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2321.0400000000004s)]
*  Chris Yeah, is that consistency, you know, the tactical consistency, something that you see as [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2323.52s)]
*  a failure point? I mean, what I don't want to put words in your mouth and make assumptions. What are [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2330.8s)]
*  failure points around creating competitive differentiation? Where have you seen [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2337.2000000000003s)]
*  companies kind of fall flat on their face or do it wrong? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2342.0s)]
*  David I've seen companies, I mean, you may not believe this, but companies that, you know, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2346.2400000000002s)]
*  you go into a meeting and they don't understand the clinical landscape for what their targets [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2353.2000000000003s)]
*  are. You know, to me, you know, the meeting should end pretty quickly after that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2359.84s)]
*  You know, so you know, you need to know your business and you need to know things and you [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2366.88s)]
*  need to be aware of things. I think that, you know, that I'd say that's how you unfavorably [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2370.96s)]
*  differentiate yourself. Right? I mean, some of this is not about just differentiating yourself. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2378.32s)]
*  It's not about putting yourself out with the garbage. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2384.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, that's where I, you know, bring the conversation, maybe not full circle, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2389.84s)]
*  but tie back to a key point here. Making sure you don't end up taking yourself out with the garbage. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2396.48s)]
*  That's very dependent on firm leadership, the folks in the foxhole, right? Who have seen that [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2401.2000000000003s)]
*  happen before and know how to avoid it. Chris [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2406.8s)]
*  Oh, I know. Absolutely. And you got to also be committed to your vision and have conviction. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2409.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's helpful to, to, to pandit to investors. I've seen that happen too often [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2417.52s)]
*  where they'll say, well, you need more in your pipeline or what about this? You know, they, [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2424.16s)]
*  you know, I think you're going down a very slippery slope when, when one does that. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2430.32s)]
*  You know, to me, the bottom line is it's important to run your business unbridled by the industry. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2438.16s)]
*  Hubris while there are no guarantees, particularly given the inherent industry risks, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2442.4s)]
*  capital efficient organizations and stakeholders, including patients will be rewarded for cost [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2448.48s)]
*  effect, the development and accelerated time to market. And I think if you, if you, if you [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2453.52s)]
*  have your conviction and you're building for the long haul, you know, there could be interlopers. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2459.92s)]
*  And I think going back to team, I think a great way to understand where this company stands and [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2464.96s)]
*  its conviction to execution, differentiation and winning is their team. If you got a middling team, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2470.88s)]
*  you know, you never going to execute, you know, and you're never going to be able to answer the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2479.36s)]
*  important questions. So I think that is the biggest differentiator and people kind of try [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2483.6s)]
*  to be cheap around it. They try to, you know, and they, and in this marketplace, I don't think you [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2489.44s)]
*  can afford to dither on these things. You know, you want to get the right people on board and it's [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2494.72s)]
*  about fit too. Right. And it's a, it's a dynamic market, but I think you need the right people, [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2502.24s)]
*  you know, if you can't do it yourself. Yeah. Yeah. And on the next episode with Alan Shaw, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2509.4399999999996s)]
*  we'll delve into the wrong people. We'll name names on the, on who's cheap and out on their people. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2514.72s)]
*  We're not, we're not really going to do that. That was just a shameless attempt to get some attention. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2520.24s)]
*  You got mine. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2528.4799999999996s)]
*  As Alan frantically shakes his head. No, we're not going to do that. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2532.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, what am I, what haven't I asked you Alan around, around competitive differentiation, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2536.9599999999996s)]
*  what and value proposition, communication, what, what, what haven't I, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2542.16s)]
*  I tackled here that you wanted to share. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2547.68s)]
*  I think we've gone through a lot, you know, probably the one area that we didn't really touch on, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2551.8399999999997s)]
*  which I think is going to be an important area for people. I mean, there's two areas. I think one is [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2556.64s)]
*  you got to be intellectually honest. You know, I think you got to be in touch with both your [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2562.72s)]
*  masculine side and feminine side, or in other words, know your strengths and your weaknesses. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2566.96s)]
*  We've touched on that before, but I can't say that enough. And I think that really informs resource [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2572.0s)]
*  allocation. You need to leverage, you know, your capabilities, understand the shortest distance, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2577.68s)]
*  you know, be mindful of what other people are doing and try to differentiate yourself in terms [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2583.6s)]
*  of your target selection and your methodology for development. And that feeds into the resource, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2590.64s)]
*  you know, one size doesn't fit all. There's different strategies for different goals. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2596.56s)]
*  You know, if you want to buy a company, but you only want the lead program, would you buy a cow [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2602.7999999999997s)]
*  if you only wanted to buy a steak? You know, so you figure out best ways of going about it. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2609.04s)]
*  You know, I think in my view, resource allocation is alive, it's living, and it has to be [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2616.96s)]
*  reevaluated. And I would recommend doing that, at least on a quarterly basis, or at least annually, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2623.68s)]
*  if nothing less than that. You know, it's critical to be able to make business decisions based [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2629.68s)]
*  on where your priorities are. And it's important to understand that there's KOL views, you want [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2638.08s)]
*  input from all the different folks, you want a 360 perspective, you want to talk to the KOLs, [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2645.12s)]
*  you want to understand the potential indications and the regulatory pathways. What are patient [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2652.08s)]
*  advocacy groups views on these things? They can be very helpful. And managed care. So, you know, [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2657.76s)]
*  there are lots of different areas, you know, you can come up with a great program, but you know, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2665.6s)]
*  is there going to be, are we going to be able to demonstrate the right value to be reimbursed for [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2670.08s)]
*  it? You know, it's show me the money. And it all co-depends on itself. So I think resource allocation [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2675.2s)]
*  is something that when you have a flood of cash, people are going to be a lot less [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2681.7599999999998s)]
*  vigilant with the way they do it. And I think we're probably in that environment right now. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2688.64s)]
*  I think the markets are tapering off. And this is a really good time for people to [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2694.7999999999997s)]
*  get in touch with their masculine side and feminine side and to tap down on the resources [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2699.2s)]
*  and look at what's the real value drivers and make sure they have enough for a rainy day. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2705.3599999999997s)]
*  Because as we know, the clinical attrition is very high in this space. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  Be able to pivot and have the financial flexibility to live another day. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2714.7999999999997s)]
*  Are you forecasting a little bit of a shakeout? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2719.3599999999997s)]
*  I guess it's something that I'm generally anxious about. The market's been going for about 10 years [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2722.96s)]
*  now by all conventional measurements. That's unprecedented. So, you know, it's something that [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2729.68s)]
*  I am sensitive to that, you know, how durable that is. And I think it's, it continues to go [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2738.16s)]
*  like a broken watch. It's going to have its day. I think we are seeing some, you know, [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2746.0s)]
*  seeing signs that the market's becoming much more discerning. Not everyone can go out right now. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2751.52s)]
*  We're looking at the way a lot of the deals are working aftermarket. They're not working super [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2757.1200000000003s)]
*  well. Even the boy band, IPOs are not working as well. Some are. Some are indeed. So from my [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2761.44s)]
*  perspective, I say the benefit of our industry and inflation, they kind of correlate. And when [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2769.6s)]
*  you have low interest rates, sign of low inflation, there's a more riskier attitude in [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2776.0s)]
*  the industry. So there's more allocation of capital. And this is all about capital flows. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2782.56s)]
*  And I think once interest rates start to go up, I mean, you know, we've been flooding the house [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2788.24s)]
*  in the basement with gasoline and kerosene, you know, it's not going to take much for that to spark [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2793.28s)]
*  up. So right now the people are presently relaxed. That wasn't the news review a couple of months ago, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2797.6s)]
*  but it's something that I think all good things have to come to an end. And, you know, I think, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2807.2799999999997s)]
*  you know, the punch bowl will get pulled at some point. So I think you need to brace yourself for [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2812.64s)]
*  it and at least, at least be mindful that this isn't going to continue indefinitely. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2818.4s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a great reminder that it's a fine time to, I guess, reevaluate or refocus on [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2823.36s)]
*  competitive differentiators. Some of the things we've discussed today. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2833.04s)]
*  So come what may of the market, you've got those differentiations to rely on. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2837.6800000000003s)]

*  look forward to doing it again soon. And in between certainly welcome the opportunity to, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXcG2247xcI&t=2858.3199999999997s)]
