# BoB@JPM: Ran Zheng, Landmark Bio
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8)
*  Ran Zheng had already built a story career at Amgen when she took the biotech dive with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=0.0s)]
*  Orchard Therapeutics where she served as CTO for a few years before being tapped on the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=10.5s)]
*  shoulder as hire number one at Landmark Bio in 2021. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=16.04s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  And I'm Ben Comer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=23.34s)]
*  And this is the Business of Biotech JP Morgan edition. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=24.76s)]
*  We're here in San Francisco with Ran for a talk on how she's applying a diverse history [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=29.66s)]
*  of biologic therapeutic development experience to her role at Landmark, building and deploying [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=34.36s)]
*  next generation cell and gene therapy manufacturing technology. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=40.46s)]
*  Ran, thanks for joining us and it's great to see you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=45.06s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=48.1s)]
*  Glad to be here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=49.1s)]
*  It's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=50.5s)]
*  I know it's a very busy week for you, so I appreciate you coming along to spend some [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=51.5s)]
*  time with us. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=55.78s)]
*  And I want to get the show off the ground here by talking a little bit about you specifically. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=57.24s)]
*  As I noted, you were Landmark's first hire, which is pretty cool. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=65.18s)]
*  I'm sure there's a pretty interesting story there because the company's grown substantially [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=68.46000000000001s)]
*  in subsequent years. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=71.9s)]
*  But what were you doing prior and why did you kind of take that leap to Landmark? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=73.78s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=78.86s)]
*  I have been very fortunate to work with a great group of people at a great company. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=80.82s)]
*  Spent 16 years at Amigen working different products in different functions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=88.41999999999999s)]
*  The last few years while I was with Amigen, I had the opportunity to touch on some unique [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=97.02s)]
*  modalities, neoantigen, oncolytic virus, sRNA. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=105.74s)]
*  I was awestruck by this new class of medicine and the transformative potential those medicines [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=112.82s)]
*  can bring to patients. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=123.22s)]
*  I worked on a lot of biologic products. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=126.26s)]
*  Most of them are treatment, not cure. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=129.18s)]
*  Some of the cell and gene therapy products have curative potential and they're once [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=133.36s)]
*  and done and allow patients to live normal life. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=142.04000000000002s)]
*  It's just amazing. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=147.8s)]
*  And I want to see more of those products on the market. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  And I also observed some gaps in the development and the commercialization of cell and gene [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=154.72s)]
*  therapies and I thought a lot what we have learned in biologics development and commercialization [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=163.72s)]
*  can be applied to this field and help accelerate the development. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=175.72s)]
*  Many of those gaps remain. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=183.2s)]
*  I want to pause there for a minute and talk about some of those gaps. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=185.56s)]
*  Many of those gaps remain, gaps around manufacturability for one but then beyond manufacturability [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=190.11999999999998s)]
*  when we get past that hurdle. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Distribution, administration. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Did you feel like Landmark might give you an opportunity to play a role in addressing [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=201.64s)]
*  those challenges too? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know, maybe I will also pause a moment and maybe kind of regroup my thoughts here. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=208.6s)]
*  So I wouldn't call it Landmark but it gives me the unique opportunities. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=223.4s)]
*  What I could just anchor on what Landmark Bio was set up to do is to remove some of [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=232.12s)]
*  the bottlenecks in the early days of cell and gene therapy development. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=239.68s)]
*  And what we, the opportunity we have there is not just, you know, just from the technology [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=247.68s)]
*  perspective but also really partner with other companies to help address some of the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=258.24s)]
*  challenges we have seen in this space. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=264.96000000000004s)]
*  So maybe what I can, you know, if you can just let me know what some of your questions [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=270.16s)]
*  are. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=275.92s)]
*  I pulled that one out of left field so we could determine. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=276.92s)]
*  No, no, I have not seen the briefing because I know, I know, Kat decided that you have [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=279.92s)]
*  some of the briefing but I didn't get a chance to. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=286.84s)]
*  Oh, that's alright. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=289.35999999999996s)]
*  That's okay. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=291.35999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=292.35999999999996s)]
*  When you, so you left Amgen for Landmark, Landmark being a startup, was there any trepidation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=293.64s)]
*  or concern around making the jump from such an established company to, I mean I understand [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=301.59999999999997s)]
*  the intent. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=307.59999999999997s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=308.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's, well, Landmark Bio is not my first startup company. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=309.59999999999997s)]
*  Okay, so you would. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=315.56s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so it was actually the third startup company but the second after Amgen experience. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=317.16s)]
*  Water Therapeutics was also a young company. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=324.68s)]
*  When I joined, I wouldn't call it a startup. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=327.08s)]
*  It has about 150-ish people maybe when I joined, so, but it's much smaller company. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=330.52s)]
*  What did it bring you to Landmark Bio? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=339.36s)]
*  Did you know Alan Garber before joining? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=341.36s)]
*  How did you land there? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=346.0s)]
*  I don't know Alan Garber. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=347.96000000000004s)]
*  You don't? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=349.48s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=350.48s)]
*  So it was probably a cold call from a recruiter. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=351.8s)]
*  But I have read the initiative so I learned a little bit about what they try to do. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=356.8s)]
*  I thought they have a very unique value proposition and it's great purpose and they're trying [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=363.12s)]
*  to do something to close the gaps and I'm willing to help. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=371.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=377.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=378.76s)]
*  You also, I think, worked to improve the manufacturing function while you were at Amgen. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=379.76s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=385.72s)]
*  Were there learnings that you brought from Amgen to your positions after that, including [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=386.8s)]
*  Landmark? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=393.84000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=394.84000000000003s)]
*  I started at Amgen as a process development scientist and I worked in different functions [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  in PD, manufacturing quality and supply chain. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  There are a lot of learnings in biologic development, particularly in the CMC space, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=412.4s)]
*  and many of those learnings are applicable, including understanding of products and understanding [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  the quality attributes, understanding how the processes affect those quality attributes [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=428.03999999999996s)]
*  and ultimately potentially impact the outcome of the products. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  It's very important. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=440.12s)]
*  There are a lot of fundamental learnings that we have gained over the past two decades are [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=441.16s)]
*  applicable to this new field. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=451.04s)]
*  So that's why when I joined Landmark Bio, even though the company is very much oriented [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=454.92s)]
*  towards bio manufacturing to provide services and to partner others, I have built a team [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=462.76s)]
*  with people who come from the pharmaceutical industry, who have done years of work in development [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=470.12s)]
*  and commercialization of biologics. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  Because not just the experience in development, but also understanding how the development [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=484.08s)]
*  should be done. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=489.84s)]
*  Is it the fundamentals that best translate? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=491.84s)]
*  I'm curious because I hear this frequently, as we improve the cell and gene manufacturing [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=495.56s)]
*  paradigm, we should lean into things that we've learned along the way in more traditional [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=502.68s)]
*  biologics. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  Is that sort of a stick to the fundamentals conversation or are there specific, I guess, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=511.76s)]
*  or manufacturing steps or lessons that translate from things like antibodies and vaccines to [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=519.72s)]
*  the cell and gene manufacturing? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=526.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're getting deep in that space, right? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=527.8s)]
*  So there is a fundamental kind of principles on how to develop a manufacturable process. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=532.92s)]
*  We're talking about the manufacturability of the process, the scalability of the process [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=539.48s)]
*  and the transferability of the process. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=544.76s)]
*  The principles, fundamentals are the same, the principles are the same. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=548.0400000000001s)]
*  It's just a very different modality. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=551.48s)]
*  You have to apply the principles and maybe understand your modality and go from there. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=553.6800000000001s)]
*  What would you say if you, looking back on the past four years at Landmark, how would [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=564.9200000000001s)]
*  you sort of characterize or quantify the progress that Landmark has contributed addressing some [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=570.52s)]
*  of these challenges? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=577.72s)]
*  So two of the unique major challenges in the cell and gene therapy space, our first one [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=580.0s)]
*  is the logistical challenges, what we call logistical challenges for patients. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=590.84s)]
*  8 out of 10 patients who are eligible for CAR T therapies are not able to get to the [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=596.6s)]
*  CAR T therapies because they just don't have access. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=606.32s)]
*  The second challenge is probably more on the company side, on the business side, the financial [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=613.24s)]
*  challenges. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=619.8000000000001s)]
*  It takes a lot of capital to develop, manufacture, deliver the products, but with the high cost [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  of manufacturing, cost of goods, that translates to a lower margin and lower return on investment. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=629.44s)]
*  So I think that challenges need to overcome so that the therapies can benefit more patients. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=637.1600000000001s)]
*  So what Landmark Bio has done in the past few years since its launch is, this is public [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=644.96s)]
*  knowledge we partner with Galapagos, European cell therapy companies and work with them [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=656.28s)]
*  to establish distributed manufacturing network. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=663.8399999999999s)]
*  We are their first bio manufacturing partner in United States and the goal for distributed [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  manufacturing is to make the CAR T products close to where patients are. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=678.4s)]
*  Many US patients even today, if they want to get access to CAR T products and they have [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=685.12s)]
*  to travel to where the treatment centers are established, usually in major cities like [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=690.88s)]
*  Boston, San Francisco, New York City, but if you live in some other places, it's difficult [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=697.0s)]
*  for a patient to get the treatment. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=704.8s)]
*  The manufacturing makes the products closer to where the patient lives, so the patient [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=711.08s)]
*  can receive treatment close to where they live. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=718.24s)]
*  So I think that's one thing that we have been working with them for a couple of years, a [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=723.88s)]
*  little bit over a year. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=732.96s)]
*  The second challenge we're talking about is how you could reduce cost of goods. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=736.08s)]
*  Cell and gene therapy today, most of them are exivable cell therapies. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=747.6800000000001s)]
*  They take materials from patients or donors, their cells, and doing gene modification [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=755.08s)]
*  and give back to patients. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=763.1600000000001s)]
*  That process is very complex. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=765.16s)]
*  They also deal with live cells and the products are also very complex. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  There are a lot of constraints in supply chain that all lead to higher cost of goods and [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=774.76s)]
*  a lower net margin, which is challenging. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=780.96s)]
*  If you can only imagine that there is a way to turn the complex exivable cell [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=785.48s)]
*  products into something more like biologics and you can give patients just like a biological [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=794.72s)]
*  injectables or IV products, how many more patients would be able to benefit, how much [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=804.08s)]
*  lower the cost of products that could be? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=811.24s)]
*  So one of the technological innovation areas that we have been focusing on is non-viral [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=816.28s)]
*  gene delivery to be able to achieve this kind of a in-vivo CAR T to leverage human [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=824.2s)]
*  body to make the products inside of the human to lower the cost of goods. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  This may be a very naive question, but theoretically, when I think about distributed manufacturing, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=842.36s)]
*  it occurs to me that that would actually exacerbate in some ways that cost of goods [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=851.56s)]
*  and cost of distribution supply chain issues. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=858.56s)]
*  It seems like it would exacerbate that problem, like make it worse because now we're taking [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=864.52s)]
*  a few manufacturing nodes and multiplying them across the country. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=869.28s)]
*  How do you rationalize that? [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=874.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=876.3199999999999s)]
*  If you don't have the technologies to support that kind of distributed manufacturing network, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=879.52s)]
*  that could increase cost of goods. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=887.12s)]
*  So the manufacturing technology platform and the supply chain platform Galapagos is deployed [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=890.12s)]
*  allow manufacturing process to be very efficient and it's very easy to tech transfer. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=899.56s)]
*  It's closed the process seven day, when to when electronic batch records. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=907.32s)]
*  So you manage information data flow electronically. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=913.2s)]
*  Everything is standardized. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  So I definitely see that is not your yesterday's distributed manufacturing where everything [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=922.4000000000001s)]
*  is manual and less standardized. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=927.6400000000001s)]
*  Because it's a highly platform, it's standardized, it will reduce the errors through the transfer. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=934.66s)]
*  It would help reduce the human errors, improve the consistency. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=945.2199999999999s)]
*  Of course, this is something that very new and we will have to see in the next few years [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=949.86s)]
*  how that will work out. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=954.6999999999999s)]
*  But we're very optimistic for that. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=956.38s)]
*  When distributed manufacturing, is that satellite manufacturing centers that are more spread [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=959.58s)]
*  out? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=966.82s)]
*  Is it actually on site like at a healthcare delivery center where that happens? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=967.82s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's not at the back side yet. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=972.82s)]
*  It's in a GMT manufacturing facility that close to medical center. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=978.1s)]
*  And those are rapidly expanding in number at this point or is that the goal eventually? [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=986.54s)]
*  Well, the goal eventually is to establish many manufacturing capabilities near the medical [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=992.5s)]
*  centers where you can make the products. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1003.3s)]
*  And if you can standardize that process and make it really efficient to your point, then [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1006.62s)]
*  that's how you get around raising the cost of goods. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1012.06s)]
*  When you addressed that, you talked about the process development lessons that can be [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1016.5s)]
*  learned from more traditional biologics. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1021.94s)]
*  And I think the last time you and I chatted, you had mentioned that there's often a gap [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1026.5s)]
*  in early stage processes coming out of academia, needing to be sort of redeveloped when they [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1031.98s)]
*  make clinical progress, much less commercialization progress. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1040.4199999999998s)]
*  So tell me a little bit about that. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1046.1399999999999s)]
*  How has Landmark contributed to the academic exercise of moving from academia to a commercially [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1050.54s)]
*  viable business? [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1061.1s)]
*  And is that driven by industry or is academia driving that as well? [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1062.74s)]
*  What's the lay of the land there? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1070.94s)]
*  Yeah, you know, what we have seen in this field in the past 20 years, particularly in [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1071.94s)]
*  cell energy and therapies, the innovations almost exclusively always started in academic [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1078.14s)]
*  centers where small biotech companies, where the science drive, you know, how the products [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1086.14s)]
*  been developed and made, but not a lot of considerations. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1095.5800000000002s)]
*  If you have to make the products not only for one patient, two patients, but hundreds, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1100.9s)]
*  thousands, millions of patients. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1106.38s)]
*  So what we have seen a lot for early cell and gene therapy products are based on laboratory [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1110.2600000000002s)]
*  protocols that could work, you know, for a fewer number of patients, but it does not [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1116.66s)]
*  drive consistency and word robustness. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1124.66s)]
*  And that will lead to some repeated work later on. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1130.74s)]
*  So what we have seen is that some early phase clinical trials conducted at the academic [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1137.3s)]
*  setting, at the academic setting, one, you know, the proof of concept, the clinical results [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1147.3s)]
*  is outstanding, but the process is not robust enough and is not suitable for larger clinical [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1159.3799999999999s)]
*  trials or commercialization. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1167.18s)]
*  What they end up to be is that you repeat those clinical trials. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1169.18s)]
*  And that is a lot of waste, a lot of money, a lot of money and a lot of time. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1176.0600000000002s)]
*  So what we do is that we work with the principal investigators from academia or the startup [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1182.3400000000001s)]
*  companies. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1192.38s)]
*  We help them to understand what is the ultimate goal for the development is to bring this [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1193.56s)]
*  drug to market. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1201.1599999999999s)]
*  And in order to do that, we need to make sure that the processes of manufacturing the products [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1203.1599999999999s)]
*  is robust and can deliver reliable, consistent product quality. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1210.1599999999999s)]
*  So with that and in mind to design the manufacturing processes, the materials and to source the [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1219.02s)]
*  materials, the starting materials for the manufacturing processes, you know, in the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1226.04s)]
*  early days so that you get some kind of standardization to make the process more suitable for commercial [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1232.4s)]
*  use, less changes that you have to make later on. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1244.12s)]
*  That will reduce some of the kind of wasted work. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1249.0s)]
*  Our friends at Alston and Byrd set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM week. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1255.58s)]
*  The firm's National Healthcare and Life Sciences practice has more than 100 attorneys actively [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1261.84s)]
*  involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1266.94s)]
*  The signature strength of this practice is its ability to master complex representations [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1272.9s)]
*  that draw on the coordinated expertise of its regulatory, compliance, public policy, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1278.36s)]
*  transactional, corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, government investigations, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1284.56s)]
*  and litigation practice areas. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1293.08s)]
*  Alston and Byrd represents life sciences companies and their partners in corporate stages ranging [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1296.0s)]
*  from private to newly public to well established and in a variety of stages of product development [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1301.04s)]
*  from preclinical to post approval commercial launch. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1307.24s)]
*  Learn more at Alston.com and tell them you learned about them on the business of biotech. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1311.34s)]
*  Is that something you would characterize, I guess, as kind of landmark bios sweet spot, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1319.06s)]
*  being able to take a process in academia or a process in a small startup and help to standardize [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1325.72s)]
*  it and make it into something that could be scaled commercially? [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1332.76s)]
*  Do you see that as your kind of primary aim? [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1339.68s)]
*  You know, it's definitely one of the unique features for landmark bios and the competitive [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1342.68s)]
*  advantage for us as well. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1349.88s)]
*  I probably mentioned a little bit earlier, we were in this space to provide CMC services [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  to a lot of our partners. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1361.12s)]
*  The people that we build are, most of them are from drug development companies. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1364.32s)]
*  So this is an organization built by drug developers for drug developers. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1369.56s)]
*  So we understand what it's really going to take to develop the process, develop the product, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1375.2s)]
*  and get to the market. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1386.0s)]
*  It definitely helps our clients and our partners to minimize some of the pitfalls and the unfortunate [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1388.56s)]
*  errors that many others made in the early days. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1403.6799999999998s)]
*  Do the challenges faced by a cell or gene startup vary a lot or are there some key challenges [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1410.32s)]
*  you mentioned, for example, non-viral vector delivery as something that I think you're [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1418.0s)]
*  working toward and it also represents a hurdle for the sector? [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1424.7199999999998s)]
*  Are there other areas that continue to be challenges that developers and landmark bio [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1429.52s)]
*  are working to overcome? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1438.6399999999999s)]
*  There are a lot of challenges. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1442.3999999999999s)]
*  First of all, cell and gene therapies are such a broad category, we tend to lump them [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1444.08s)]
*  together, but cell and gene therapies, including cell therapies, including gene-modified cell [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1451.12s)]
*  therapies, viral vectors. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1457.6s)]
*  So there are some unique aspects of the challenges that depends on the different specific modalities. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1461.12s)]
*  For example, when we talked about the viral vector in the AAV space, the titer, the purity [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1468.72s)]
*  definitely is one of the challenges from the CMC perspective, but from efficacy perspective, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1477.76s)]
*  the capsid and the design of the capsid, there are a lot of unique challenges. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1484.88s)]
*  We're certainly not doing everything to address all the challenges over there and we want [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1490.3999999999999s)]
*  to focus on the things that we believe that can move the needle. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1499.52s)]
*  For example, we think cell therapy is going to stay, there are already blockbuster autologous [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1506.1599999999999s)]
*  cell therapies are there. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1514.0s)]
*  If we can make those therapies better and if we can manufacture them faster and cheaper, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1516.88s)]
*  that will allow patients or provide better access to patients, just at least from manufacturing [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1526.08s)]
*  perspective. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1533.44s)]
*  That's really our approach. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1536.16s)]
*  We're very optimistic in the non-viral gene delivery space because we truly believe if [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1538.96s)]
*  we can turn the complex product into relatively simpler product, easier to manufacture, easier [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1547.68s)]
*  to deliver, that will really change the field. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1557.2s)]
*  You're in an interesting space because in many ways you have a first-hand look at not [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1562.0s)]
*  just innovation, but business volume. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1571.92s)]
*  I've had a couple of conversations today with cell and gene therapy leaders who talk [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1576.8s)]
*  about the ebb and flow of the economic interest, the finance community's interest in gene [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1582.4s)]
*  therapy, I guess more specifically. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  What's your take on that from your perspective, given that you see the innovation first-hand, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1593.84s)]
*  you see the volume of interest in manufacturing services first-hand? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1599.28s)]
*  Do you have a good feeling heading into 25 that business will be robust on the innovation [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1604.4s)]
*  and funding scale, or is there any cause for concern? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1609.52s)]
*  I am a firm believer of cell and gene therapies and the transformative potentials this class [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1616.48s)]
*  of therapies can bring to patients. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1624.8s)]
*  It's already beyond the proof of concept. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1628.24s)]
*  The challenges we're facing is from a business perspective, is that yes, we have seen the [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1632.8s)]
*  benefit on patients, but we want to see more patients being benefited by this new class [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1642.08s)]
*  of medicine. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1652.48s)]
*  Look, the innovation has no value if it does not reach to patients. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1653.04s)]
*  I think that's really the fundamental challenge over there. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1657.8400000000001s)]
*  Right now, we want this class of therapies to be able to reach a broader patient population. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1662.3200000000002s)]
*  In order to do that, there are some technological hurdles that we have to overcome, but I think [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1669.92s)]
*  the science is proven and is validated in humans. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1677.0400000000002s)]
*  We know it works, and we know it has curative, transformative potential, and it's on us to [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1681.28s)]
*  make this work. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1689.36s)]
*  It's interesting to me, too, like you said, that cell and gene therapies is a basket term [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1693.36s)]
*  for a whole bunch of different approaches. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1700.56s)]
*  How does a company like Landmark ensure that you have the expertise, not just the capacity, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1702.8799999999999s)]
*  but the expertise to stay on top of all this stuff? [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1710.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1713.1200000000001s)]
*  We set up our business to have quite broad capabilities. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1717.52s)]
*  We're not just focusing on cell therapies or gene therapies. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1724.0s)]
*  We have capabilities in cell, gene, and messenger RNA for a couple of reasons. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1728.4s)]
*  One reason is we think this field is still early, and the winners are yet to emerge. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1735.2s)]
*  We have seen the field moving from ex vivo to in vivo because we think that's where the field [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1743.52s)]
*  is going. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1752.32s)]
*  We need to start in ex vivo, and we want to capture the current opportunities, [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1753.76s)]
*  but still with eye towards the future. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1759.6799999999998s)]
*  That's how we set up. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1763.28s)]
*  There are a lot of spaces, a lot of areas we can innovate, and we definitely not try to do [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1766.96s)]
*  everything. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1773.6799999999998s)]
*  As I mentioned, some places that we try to innovate, for example, non-viral gene delivery, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1776.96s)]
*  we think that's the area that we should focus on because it addresses the underlying issues [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1785.6s)]
*  for cell energy and therapy. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1791.2s)]
*  You've got to be able to deliver the genetic material to the right cells, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1792.64s)]
*  and that's what we need to focus on. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1798.4s)]
*  What kind of delivery materials are leading the charge in that area to get away from viral vectors? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1802.48s)]
*  So we are looking into nanoparticle technologies. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1815.28s)]
*  Lipid nanoparticle is one aspect. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1821.6s)]
*  We also have other non-lipid nanoparticles. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1824.32s)]
*  Does the innovation there in terms of delivery vehicles tend to happen from within, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1832.8s)]
*  or is it largely influenced by the developers that you're working with? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1838.72s)]
*  Innovation coming from the sponsor community? [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1843.6s)]
*  Well, we have seen both, but in that space, I think we see the opportunity that the sponsors [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1847.36s)]
*  would rely on their partners to bring the technologies. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1860.16s)]
*  What we have seen more and more is that sponsors focusing on what's inside of the particle, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1865.2s)]
*  what's inside that encapsulation, which is the design of the RNA, the design of the DNA, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1873.04s)]
*  and what the capabilities we bring in is more of how we could take those DNA or RNA or oligos [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1881.28s)]
*  and package them in a way that they can get to the right cells and the right tissues. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1891.84s)]
*  Yeah. Have you noticed any particular energy being devoted to [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1897.68s)]
*  developing delivery technologies that seek targets that are in places that are impossible [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1907.52s)]
*  to get to before, like the blood brain barrier, different organs? Is there a movement afoot there? [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1917.92s)]
*  Yeah. People try to deliver the target genes to muscles, to different cell types, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1924.08s)]
*  because the current technologies, if you give the current lipid nanoparticle technology [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1932.8s)]
*  formulations, most of them go to the liver. Long is another space where I see a lot of development. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1939.9199999999998s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you have a sense of the broad, I guess, cell and gene sector and how much it [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1949.28s)]
*  collaborates? I'm thinking of 25 years ago with monoclonal antibodies. I think there were [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1959.44s)]
*  some companies at a precommercial basis that would share knowledge and work together to try to [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1967.8400000000001s)]
*  bring that functionality forward. Is there a similar effort in cell and gene that you're [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1975.3600000000001s)]
*  aware of? I mean, is Landmark Bio working as a convener of sorts between different companies [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1981.44s)]
*  and helping to fill those gaps? Yeah. We're part of the Nimble, which is a consortium. They [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1988.72s)]
*  have a lot of initiatives in cell and gene therapy space, a lot of work being done in the AAV space. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=1995.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a pretty competitive space where people can share knowledge and experience. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2004.96s)]
*  Okay. Yeah. What are you most excited about in terms of the cell and gene space? You talked [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2012.0s)]
*  about your excitement for the transformative opportunity, the patient opportunity in cell [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2019.7600000000002s)]
*  and gene leading you to Landmark. Now you've been there for four years, looking ahead, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2028.72s)]
*  another four years perhaps or even a year. What are you most excited about? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2033.12s)]
*  The opportunity is ahead of us. I'm very excited about the opportunities in front of us where we [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2038.6399999999999s)]
*  can really make a difference. It took about 10 years to have a blockbuster of monoclonal antibodies [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2047.44s)]
*  early days. We already have a few blockbusters of cell and gene therapy on the market and start [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2057.28s)]
*  benefiting patients. That is very exciting for us. Also, the amount of innovation in this space, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2066.48s)]
*  what we have seen is unprecedented. That is something that we're very excited about. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2075.84s)]
*  Yeah. What are your goals for JP Morgan, if you have any that are specific to this conference? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2084.32s)]
*  My goal for JPM week is really to connect with the industry peers, the colleagues, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2094.0800000000004s)]
*  potential partners and collaborators, exchange ideas, explore collaboration opportunities, [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2101.84s)]
*  and really discuss the trend of where we're going as an industry, as a sector. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2110.32s)]
*  It's a very exciting week. Yeah. Where did you come in from? Are you in the San Francisco area? [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2116.88s)]
*  No, I am based in Boston, but I also have a house in Southern California. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2123.84s)]
*  Okay. I actually came from the LA area. Okay. This episode will drop more than likely [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2131.92s)]
*  sometime in February, so a few weeks from now. As we said right now, things aren't looking that [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2142.0s)]
*  great in LA. I'm hoping that everything's okay in your neighborhood. Yeah, everything is okay in [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2150.08s)]
*  my neighborhood. We're fortunate, but it's a very challenging time. I'm sure. Yeah. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2155.76s)]
*  Safe travels, and thank you for spending, like I said, some of your very busy week [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2163.0400000000004s)]
*  with the business of biotech. I appreciate you coming on the show. It's great to get insight, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2167.44s)]
*  like great to get insight from a leader in the cell and gene manufacturing space, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2172.6400000000003s)]
*  given all the questions and challenges that are ahead. We appreciate it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2177.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for having me. That's Landmark Bio CEO Ran Zheng. I'm Matt Piller. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52RjWPbliB8&t=2181.36s)]
