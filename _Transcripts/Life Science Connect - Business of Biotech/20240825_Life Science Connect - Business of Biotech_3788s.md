Video Description: Guest co-host Anna Rose Welch of Advancing RNA fame joins us on this week’s Business of Biotech podcast for a conversation with the leaders of RNA upstart Radar Therapeutics. The company’s co-founders, Eerik Kaseniit, Ph.D. (CSO & President) and Sophia Lugo (CEO), are making waves in the mRNA therapeutics space on the heels of the invention of a precision-expressed mRNA technology that laid bare the path to Radar’s inception. On this episode, we dig into that science, why it’s timely, and how it fits into today’s mRNA therapeutics landscape. We also go deep on how Kaseniit and Lugo went about navigating the complexities of biotech formation, leaning into their networks andbuilding up a team—and each other—along the way. Their work is paying off, as the fast-growing company is attracting gobs of investor and big bio attention. For more on the technology Radar is bringing to bear, read Kaseniit and Lugo’s recent byline at Cell & Gene.

# mRNA Upstarts With Radar Therapeutics' Sophia Lugo and Eerik Kaseniit, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY)
*  You know, Anna Rose, when you first suggested today's guest on the Business of Biotech podcast, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=0.0s)]
*  I have to admit I was a little bit skeptical. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=8.64s)]
*  I'm a little hurt to hear that because we've shared a wall for many, many years. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  We have, and you've never given me a bad steer. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=15.36s)]
*  I'm starting to get, I'm getting the sense that that meant less. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=17.76s)]
*  You've never given me a bad steer, but this was a long time, it was quite a while ago, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=20.64s)]
*  weeks, months. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=23.96s)]
*  I don't remember, frankly, but I know. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=24.96s)]
*  I checked out the founders LinkedIn page and it said something like founder of Schmader Schmariputics [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=27.52s)]
*  or something along those lines. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=35.6s)]
*  And I was like, what is this? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=36.96s)]
*  See, when I saw that I was like, they need to be on the podcast. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  And if I had a million dollars to give them, I would pay out of pocket. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=41.92s)]
*  I can see where you're going. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=46.16s)]
*  I would have been your first funder just for that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=48.16s)]
*  You're still taking more. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=51.68s)]
*  So yeah, excellent. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=52.88s)]
*  There we go. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=54.16s)]
*  We'll get into that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=54.64s)]
*  It turns out that this was their stealth mode moniker Schmader Schmariputics. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=57.28s)]
*  And yeah, they're out of stealth mode now and they're out of stealth mode with a bang. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=62.72s)]
*  And my skepticism is entirely erased. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=67.2s)]
*  The founders official were out of stealth mode post on LinkedIn. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=70.64s)]
*  In fact, listed a veritable who's who of partners and supporters and advisors and people throwing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=74.8s)]
*  money, space and time at this company. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=81.2s)]
*  To advance its RNA therapeutics program. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=84.8s)]
*  And our guests seem to have a pretty cool founding story to tell that I'm anxious to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=87.76s)]
*  hear from them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=92.72s)]
*  Fresh off a Stanford PhD in bioengineering, Dr. Eric Casanet is shaping his PhD project [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=93.52s)]
*  into a business in lockstep with CEO Sophia Lugo, who brings a super interesting and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=101.68s)]
*  multifaceted collection of private, public and nonprofit life sciences leadership experience [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=108.56s)]
*  to the table. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=113.52s)]
*  But I'm not going to tell the story here. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=114.96s)]
*  We're going to invite them to Sophia and Eric. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=117.36s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  We're honored to have you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=121.84s)]
*  Thank you for having us. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=123.52s)]
*  We are so happy to be on Business of Biotech. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=124.72s)]
*  You know, we were just we were just Business of Biotech was just named the top biotech [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=128.56s)]
*  podcast by Feedspot. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  I know you're so fancy. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't know who Feedspot is, but I was like, you give me a number one. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=136.56s)]
*  I'm going to take it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=140.32s)]
*  You didn't pay them to do that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=140.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  So, yeah, we're super thrilled to have you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=142.96s)]
*  We're going to solidify our number one status, I'm sure, after this episode. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=145.6s)]
*  I want to, Eric, I want to start with you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=150.24s)]
*  I want to start with you. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  I want to get the story behind the discovery that planted the seed like dial way back, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=152.8s)]
*  you know, to the work you were doing in your PhD project. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=158.0s)]
*  You were born. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=160.56s)]
*  We're not going to go that far back. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=162.16s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure there's an interesting story there. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=166.72s)]
*  I'm sure. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=169.12s)]
*  What was it? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=170.32000000000002s)]
*  What was it in your mind that that that sort of planted the seed and then what generated [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=170.96s)]
*  this initial buzz? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=175.52s)]
*  We do have to go back a little bit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  So I would go back to 2012. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=180.0s)]
*  That was the summer of CRISPR. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=181.84s)]
*  It was a very exciting time. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=184.88000000000002s)]
*  I was an undergrad around then. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=185.84s)]
*  And my summer project was actually to think about the same problem that stuck with me for [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  more than a decade now, which was how do we make an mRNA that could be controlled [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=193.84s)]
*  within a cell? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=198.16s)]
*  That was a very exciting time. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=199.76s)]
*  Like I mentioned, CRISPR had just come out to to edit DNA at the same time, actually, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=201.44s)]
*  a slightly less known publication came out to show that you can also modify RNA in a [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=207.35999999999999s)]
*  guided fashion using eight enzymes, which you might get to later. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  And that summer I was working in a lab as an undergrad and was right next to Moderna. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  So Moderna was actually a household name for us. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=222.64s)]
*  So in my mind, RNA therapeutics was bound to be a platform, if not the platform. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  And it was built as a software for life. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=231.92s)]
*  But as a computer scientist myself and a molecular biologist, I was like, well, if you only have a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=235.04s)]
*  print statement, just make something. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=239.51999999999998s)]
*  That's not quite what software is. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  You would want to do if-then-else statements and really control the flow of information [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=244.79999999999998s)]
*  and manipulate biology. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=249.76s)]
*  So I was a card carrying synthetic biologist really thinking about how do we think of these [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=252.08s)]
*  tiny little machines that make up our body? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=257.2s)]
*  And how do we fix when these little engines get broken? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=260.96s)]
*  How do we fix them? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=263.28s)]
*  mRNA seemed to be the great solution because an mRNA can be read by any cell. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=264.24s)]
*  But that's also its weakness. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=269.44s)]
*  You cannot control which cells get the fix. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=270.8s)]
*  And so that summer I spent a lot of time thinking, how can we take these genetic medicines, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=274.24s)]
*  these new mRNA therapeutics that were bound to come out, of course, took a little bit of time [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=279.6s)]
*  for that to really emerge. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=284.32000000000005s)]
*  But how do we take these mRNA medicines and control them? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  And to me, it was obvious that we needed this kind of layer of regulation. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=289.36s)]
*  We needed to fix the right cells at the right time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  We couldn't take a chainsaw and do cell surgery. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=296.0s)]
*  We needed a scalpel to really fix it. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=299.12s)]
*  So I did take some detours after undergrad to be in the DNA world for a little bit. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=301.68s)]
*  And I did find myself at Stanford doing my PhD with Professor Shazhing Gao. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  So when he came to me with this idea that, hey, I had this neat kind of invention where [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=311.76000000000005s)]
*  we could take an mRNA and regulate it expression so that only specific cell cells that we want [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=317.36s)]
*  to express that RNA are expressing that RNA, I was a very prepared mind. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  I already knew that this was going to be the future. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=326.24s)]
*  This was around 2021, 2022 when this was all happening. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=329.36s)]
*  The vaccines were out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  mRNAs as a medicine were already proven. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=337.84s)]
*  But the next step would be, how can we regulate how these mRNAs are expressed? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=340.8s)]
*  That vision has stayed with me, and now we had a way to actually implement that vision. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=348.71999999999997s)]
*  And it was later also very exciting to hear that Jim Collins over at MIT was also thinking [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=353.68s)]
*  about this problem the same way. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=359.12s)]
*  And like I mentioned, I'm a card-carrying synthetic biologist. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=360.4s)]
*  So to see that the father of synthetic biology was on the same wavelength as us was very [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=364.32s)]
*  exciting. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=369.36s)]
*  So Jim and Shazhing are both co-founders of the company, and that's just been very exciting. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=369.76s)]
*  So in terms of Buzz, when we put out the preprint describing this idea, we got calls basically [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=376.88s)]
*  the next day or emails from VCs, from companies looking to implement this technology and really [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=381.84s)]
*  wanting to see how do we take this technology and bring out the vision that was behind this idea of [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=386.4s)]
*  how do we regulate and control these genetic medicines more broadly? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=393.12s)]
*  Before those inbound calls and emails came in, were the wheels already turning in your brain [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=397.68s)]
*  that we're going to turn this into, we're going to take this to industry. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=404.64s)]
*  This is going to be a science experiment. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=408.08s)]
*  But for sure, I knew that this would be a therapeutic one day. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=411.04s)]
*  I didn't know what route we would take there. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=415.36s)]
*  So that was an open question. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=417.76s)]
*  I was, it was not my plan to go and start a company when I was going into grad school, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=419.2s)]
*  but I was dipping my toes in understanding how does this all work? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=424.16s)]
*  You know, how do you take this science idea, maybe a preprint or a paper and turn that [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=429.12s)]
*  into medicines? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=433.52s)]
*  It's a long process. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=434.24s)]
*  So I started educating myself on this aspect. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  How to see it all the way through to the end, right? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=442.56s)]
*  Basic science all the way through. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=445.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's where Sophia comes in, right? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=447.12s)]
*  Like Sophia, tell us in your words, how and when you came on the scene. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=450.08s)]
*  Yeah, so I'd say my day one of grad school, of my MBA, I was very sure I wanted to start a company. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=455.52s)]
*  Had a bit of an entrepreneurial bug because I'm a very passionate, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=462.8s)]
*  ambitious and stubborn person. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=466.96s)]
*  A stubborn about how I want the world to look. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=470.4s)]
*  And for me, healthcare access and equity have always been very important, and I can talk about that, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=473.52000000000004s)]
*  but it is deeply personal to me. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=477.68s)]
*  And the entrepreneurial bug, my family is entrepreneurial. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=480.72s)]
*  We've always had a family business. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=483.92s)]
*  My dad started a farm from zero to what it is today. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=485.36s)]
*  When I was young, it was an all hands on deck. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=490.32s)]
*  Everyone's helping out back then and, you know, moving up to getting familiarized with the US [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=492.72s)]
*  healthcare system and feeling very passionately that it needed to change. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=498.72s)]
*  I knew going into business school that that's what I wanted to do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=502.08s)]
*  So day one, I started getting very involved in everything that Stanford Business School had to [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=504.88s)]
*  offer for entrepreneurship, which is a lot. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=510.4s)]
*  It is a great institution if you want to be an entrepreneur. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=512.0s)]
*  From, you know, as president of the Entrepreneurship Club, president of the Hispanic Business [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=516.0s)]
*  Student Association, I was working with, I ended up working with a lot of PhDs and professors at [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=520.0s)]
*  Stanford on very exciting technologies. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=527.12s)]
*  Because at the time, I was working at the Stanford Office of Technology Licensing in a program [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=529.6s)]
*  called the HIT Fund. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=536.16s)]
*  And I believe it stands for High Potential Impact Translational Program. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=537.76s)]
*  But I'm sorry, Natine, if I got that wrong, but HIT Fund. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=542.3199999999999s)]
*  And the idea is that it's the HIT Fund is supposed to look at the most innovative, most promising, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  most popular by hits by the amount of people that request these licenses. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=553.04s)]
*  Technologies coming out of Stanford. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=556.48s)]
*  And I was the life sciences fellow. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  And so my job was get these Stanford technologies into the world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=558.88s)]
*  Part of that was assess commercial readiness, assess commercial opportunity. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=562.88s)]
*  And then a lot of, OK, let's make the first pitch deck for this professor. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=567.84s)]
*  Let's take them to their first VC meeting or let's identify VCs that can actually work [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=572.88s)]
*  well with these professors or other routes of funding. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=576.6400000000001s)]
*  It does not have to be VC. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=579.2800000000001s)]
*  And so I was very excited about that. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes it was talking to PhDs and postdocs about what it would mean to start a company [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=583.44s)]
*  and what they had to think about. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=587.44s)]
*  And sometimes it was doing customer discovery for them. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=588.88s)]
*  So this was a really great opportunity because I had already heard of Radar. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=591.84s)]
*  It was a very popular license. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=595.84s)]
*  And I was primed to think about mRNA because I had recently been at the Gates Foundation [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=597.84s)]
*  where we were, I was partly responsible for setting up a program called the HIT Fund. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=604.64s)]
*  Partly responsible for setting up COVAX and figuring out the financial and operational [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=611.04s)]
*  risks and then tracking COVAX supply chain manufacturing delivery. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=614.88s)]
*  Part of that was mRNA vaccines. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=619.52s)]
*  Super exciting time to be watching this new modality work at breakthrough pace through [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=621.36s)]
*  development and get emergency approval. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=628.24s)]
*  So I was primed to really believe in the power of mRNA. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=630.88s)]
*  I was also working on some companies on the side. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=636.56s)]
*  I've been in two accelerators on different ideas around innovations I thought could [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=638.24s)]
*  be impactful. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=642.7199999999999s)]
*  A mutual friend, Anna Julia, I must have mentioned RNA to her and my excitement about RNA. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=643.76s)]
*  And she insisted that I meet Eric, the best RNA guy she knew who really wanted to start [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=650.0s)]
*  a company and was in a different class at Stanford about entrepreneurship. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=656.0s)]
*  So Eric and I did meet and we had lunch the first time. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=661.4399999999999s)]
*  And it did feel, it felt like the right moment. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=666.64s)]
*  I actually, in my open book bag, I had a book called the Genome Defense on the patent strategy [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=669.1999999999999s)]
*  that was crafted for AMP versus Myriad in the case that decided that naturally occurring [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=676.16s)]
*  sequences of DNA could not be patented. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=680.96s)]
*  And Eric had worked at council and had a lot of thoughts about Myriad. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=683.1999999999999s)]
*  So we won't say them here, but we'll say that we had a long discussion about, not about [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=687.92s)]
*  radar even, but it was about science making, about our values, about our personal motivations, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=692.72s)]
*  about what is the kind of world we want to see. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=697.6800000000001s)]
*  We felt we had a lot in common. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=701.6800000000001s)]
*  By the second meeting, we started talking about starting a company together. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=704.0s)]
*  And then we took that process very seriously. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=708.5600000000001s)]
*  Over a few months, we did actually a trial period of working together where we had a [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=711.84s)]
*  date on the calendar where we said by this day, if it doesn't work out, we can say no, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=715.6800000000001s)]
*  no, no. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=719.52s)]
*  Point. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=720.48s)]
*  Cut the cord. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=721.68s)]
*  An escape plan. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=723.36s)]
*  Somebody texts you have an emergency at home. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=724.24s)]
*  I've got to go. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=726.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=727.52s)]
*  I mean, I remember actually on that day approaching the school, I'm like, well, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=728.0s)]
*  I'm going to say yes. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=730.88s)]
*  I hope he says yes. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=731.68s)]
*  Check yes or no. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=733.92s)]
*  Will you be my partner? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=735.04s)]
*  Like, will you be my business partner? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=736.3199999999999s)]
*  So yeah, that was a very exciting time. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=740.48s)]
*  And my philosophy is always get the idea out there. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=742.88s)]
*  I mean, you've got this great idea. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=745.6s)]
*  I think it has immense potential. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=747.52s)]
*  At the time, I'm also secretly diligently Eric. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=749.28s)]
*  I'm trying to find out what do people who know him think about him? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=751.6s)]
*  What do people think about his paper? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=754.56s)]
*  I thought it was exciting. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=756.72s)]
*  And I was a fellow at a few VCs at the time working part time for a VC and then [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=757.6s)]
*  working with two other VCs as a fellow. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=765.28s)]
*  So I was familiar with some VCs that could help me diligence. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=767.76s)]
*  I brought the paper to them and thought, you know, I think this is exciting. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=770.64s)]
*  I think this could make in vivo reprogram ability work for genetic medicines. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=774.0799999999999s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=778.8s)]
*  And they agreed. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=779.52s)]
*  If you make this work, that is extremely exciting. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=780.4s)]
*  So I did go through a process of vetting it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=783.76s)]
*  We put our pitch deck together and we just started working on crafting the story and [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=786.4799999999999s)]
*  crafting where it could actually be applied. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=790.7199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's the story. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=793.8399999999999s)]
*  I know. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=796.4799999999999s)]
*  I love that it was too so much about who you are as people, right? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=797.1999999999999s)]
*  And the world that you really wanted to build. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=800.8s)]
*  It wasn't let's just jump into this project and try to develop strategy right out the gate. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=802.4799999999999s)]
*  Let's just talk science like it was literally about your interests, right? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=808.24s)]
*  And who you are and what you want. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=812.16s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=814.16s)]
*  I think we should give Eric a minute to talk about his vetting process. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=814.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=818.4s)]
*  What sort of diligence were you running on Sophia at the time? [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=820.0s)]
*  And secretly, was there ever a chance that you were going to check the no box, right? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=822.96s)]
*  On the business? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=827.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=830.16s)]
*  From the very first meeting, there was just a lot of mind melding [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=834.24s)]
*  and seeing that our vectors were just very aligned. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=838.0s)]
*  And it was more just getting to know each other. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=841.6s)]
*  We went through lots of questions every day, almost every day. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=844.48s)]
*  I would come from Berkeley to Stanford because that's where I've been living for a while. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=847.6s)]
*  And I would sometimes call Sophia in the car and we would go on walks on campus just to [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=852.8s)]
*  discuss these questions, these bigger questions. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=858.88s)]
*  Not always the technology, not always the plans, but these bigger questions like Sophia [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=861.44s)]
*  mentioned because on my side of the story, I had taken this class, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=865.6s)]
*  Lean Lashbets, kind of startup on guardrails. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=870.72s)]
*  And you were doing customers discovery, thinking about the business plan. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=873.76s)]
*  And the main value I got of it, I think, is not having to pace around the room for five [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  minutes before I pick up the phone to call someone. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  Because as part of it, you have to do 100 conversations over 10 weeks with folks. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=885.52s)]
*  And that gave me a lot of confidence. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=889.84s)]
*  But as part of those conversations, I also talked to a lot of founders. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=891.36s)]
*  And it's been really great to be in the Bay Area because I feel like every founder here [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=894.72s)]
*  has been super generous with their time and sitting with me for up to three hours just [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=900.48s)]
*  to give advice and feedback and share experiences. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=907.52s)]
*  So I talked to folks who had gone out at solo, had co-founders with them, understand the [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=911.76s)]
*  dynamics, things that went well, things that didn't go well. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=917.36s)]
*  So that's just been my approach, really strong preparation, understand what I'm getting into. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=920.4000000000001s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=928.88s)]
*  I was just going to ask, what were some of the go-to questions or pieces of information [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  you wanted to know from Sophia? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=935.0400000000001s)]
*  What were your go-to's that you had learned from other CEOs and co-founders that kind [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=937.7600000000001s)]
*  of helped you inform, yeah, I'm going to check yes on this box. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=943.2800000000001s)]
*  Right? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=946.8000000000001s)]
*  This is the company for me. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=947.12s)]
*  There's actually a few resources we leveraged on these questions. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=950.5600000000001s)]
*  There's a co-founder matching questionnaire that's out there for one of the VCs. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=953.2s)]
*  That's about 50 questions. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=957.6s)]
*  And you go through it and it's really everything about how you think about setting up the company, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=958.8000000000001s)]
*  how do you think about conflict resolution, how do you think about bringing in your people [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=963.6s)]
*  expertise from the outside. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=968.6400000000001s)]
*  There's a million choices you have to make in the lifetime of the company. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=972.0s)]
*  And how do you go about making these choices? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=976.08s)]
*  What's the kind of North Star, the ground truth that you always lean on? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=978.8000000000001s)]
*  So we just kind of discussed a lot on the past experiences. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=982.96s)]
*  I wanted to see how Sophia dealt with challenges or sought them out. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=986.8000000000001s)]
*  And I think the very first thing that maybe I actually haven't shared with you, but I [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=991.76s)]
*  think it was like day two or three where we were working on a one-page description of [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=998.24s)]
*  the company. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1003.0400000000001s)]
*  And we were working on it and I think we were kind of like mid-sentence, you know, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1003.68s)]
*  typing something out. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1008.56s)]
*  And Sophia was like, all right, let's go. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1009.28s)]
*  Let's go to the business school quad and just talk to people, see if this resonates. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1010.64s)]
*  And like that kind of go-getter attitude was actually what kind of already, but in some [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1014.96s)]
*  ways, check the box with me. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1018.48s)]
*  Most of the rest of the discussions were identifying any red flags, but also understanding [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1020.48s)]
*  how to work with someone. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1025.36s)]
*  Like in the future when things are going to be a lot more intense, a lot more involved, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1026.48s)]
*  a lot more high stakes, a lot less time to think about things. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1030.08s)]
*  Can we use this time right now to really get to know each other, how we communicate, how [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1033.84s)]
*  we disagree? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1038.3999999999999s)]
*  Actually, we tried to have like a little bit of a disagreement on how much should we raise? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1040.48s)]
*  You know, just something that was so far ahead of us that it didn't quite matter. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1045.76s)]
*  But I wanted to see like, how do we work through it? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1050.56s)]
*  I think we were seeing where we pulled these plans so that it's not just all kind of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  fun and, you know, but actually working through a model conflict in a way that was kind of [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1059.84s)]
*  low stakes in some ways, but to understand how do we come out of it the other way? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1066.32s)]
*  Because I think, you know, having heard that co-founder dynamics are just so important [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1070.72s)]
*  for the success of a company, that was really important for me because, you know, my job [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  is to make sure that we actually make it through all the way and grab the right people. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1080.9599999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, it's great. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1085.36s)]
*  Sounds like there's the combination of your individual and collective ambition and diligence [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1088.48s)]
*  is a key element of this. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1095.0400000000002s)]
*  Sophia, the programs that you're referencing from Stanford, I imagine that there are a bunch of [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1097.3600000000001s)]
*  jealous listeners right now, aspirational, you know, would be first time founders who are thinking [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1104.0800000000002s)]
*  back to their PhD projects and the institutions they went to. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  They've told me, I mean, they've been on this very podcast. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1115.3600000000001s)]
*  I've heard it time and time again that the translation, I don't mean translational science, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1117.76s)]
*  I mean the translation of a concept to industry and the support to enable and nurture that [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1123.12s)]
*  translation is missing. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1131.52s)]
*  And like I said, big, I'm not going to name names, but big public, you know, and private [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1133.28s)]
*  important research institutions. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1138.48s)]
*  Sounds like Stanford had that in spades. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1140.24s)]
*  I mean, it sounds like Stanford, you know, supported the mission from the outset. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1143.12s)]
*  Yes, I do have to say so, at least from my vantage point, particularly at the business [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1148.24s)]
*  school, it helps when, you know, I joined the school and I'm so sure I want to start a company [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1152.72s)]
*  and I am not an uncommon story. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1157.6s)]
*  I mean, I think the entrepreneurship club is the biggest club. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1160.4s)]
*  A lot of my, you know, I had, maybe not in biotech, but for my immediate class, a huge [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1163.84s)]
*  network of CEOs of other people, founding companies. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1170.24s)]
*  You know, we have, you know, I had my professors in licensing negotiations. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1175.44s)]
*  We're also on the phone when we had to negotiate our first license. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1180.48s)]
*  I have my professor in BC on the phone when we have to negotiate the first term sheet. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1183.68s)]
*  We have the world's best people. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1188.64s)]
*  And I think that's a common theme. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1190.72s)]
*  If you can't control biology, you could definitely control the caliber of people that you have [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1192.4s)]
*  around you. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1196.0800000000002s)]
*  And you have to, like Eriks, you have to be willing to pick up the phone and ask them. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  But at Stanford, people are so primed to do that. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1202.16s)]
*  I'll also say that it's also true for Berkeley. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1205.68s)]
*  Stanford and Berkeley, I think people are so primed to help. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1208.16s)]
*  You know, I had another professor, Howie Rosen, who's been a CEO and chairman of several [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1212.48s)]
*  biotech biopharma companies. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1217.5200000000002s)]
*  And he was also there to help me on a very specific journey, think about how to think [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1219.0400000000002s)]
*  about things and VCs as well. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1223.3600000000001s)]
*  We, our first engagements for VCs were all very much advice seeking. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1224.96s)]
*  The VC has a, they have an incentive to work with you and to help you figure this out and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1230.88s)]
*  start to form a relationship, whether for this company or the next. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  And I had several VCs that really spent a lot of time with us thinking about, well, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1240.64s)]
*  you have a platform, where are you going to point it? [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1245.3600000000001s)]
*  This is how we can think about it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1247.2s)]
*  We bounce back and forth on our thinking. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1249.6000000000001s)]
*  So really being able to pull in all that support has been really important for us. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1251.92s)]
*  And yeah, Stanford and the entire environment of Silicon Valley has been super helpful. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1254.8s)]
*  Go ahead, Eric. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1261.3600000000001s)]
*  I'll mention that. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1262.4s)]
*  I think one time you were on the phone with one of one of these professors at like 10 [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1263.2s)]
*  PM, I was at a rock concert and you were texting me on the notes. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1267.1200000000001s)]
*  We were at a dinner party, but I was like, you know, we have to do this negotiation tomorrow. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1271.76s)]
*  And he's like, I'm at a dinner party, but let's get on the phone. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1276.96s)]
*  Operation dinner party. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1279.28s)]
*  That's in the Bay Area, not just Stanford, but also Berkeley. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1282.48s)]
*  We're very glad to be in Baker Labs, which is an incubator facility here in Berkeley. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1286.32s)]
*  And they have a great network of advisors that we broke down officially as well that [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1290.0800000000002s)]
*  can really help you get off the ground to begin with. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1295.1200000000001s)]
*  And we should mention Svetlana here. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1298.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  Svetlana before me. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1300.32s)]
*  Yeah, Svetlana Lucas, the CBO at Scribe Therapeutics was actually a very good friend of mine. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1302.32s)]
*  At Scribe Therapeutics was actually one of the advisors in the Lean Launchpad class that I took. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1307.6s)]
*  And just volunteering her time to help these students kind of do a mock startup. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1313.04s)]
*  Of course, this idea ended up being a real company and she's an advisor to us now as well. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1318.56s)]
*  But just the generosity and time has been wonderful. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1323.28s)]
*  I have no idea how these people find the time because they're negotiating all these complex [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1326.08s)]
*  transactions and doing the actual work they need to do, but also making sure that they help this [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1330.08s)]
*  next generation of folks and pass on their knowledge and wisdom and experiences. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1334.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1339.68s)]
*  You've both referenced some resources that you've sought out on your own aside from the [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1340.24s)]
*  sort of infrastructure there at Stanford. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1345.68s)]
*  What advice would you give to the folks who I referenced earlier who maybe don't have so much [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1349.28s)]
*  resource immediately available to them in their quest in terms of going out and seeking out [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1354.0s)]
*  advice and guidance on things early thinking around IP protection and VC engagement and even [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1361.68s)]
*  moving towards early CMC decisions and manufacturability. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1370.48s)]
*  Like do we have something that we think is even worth taking that next baby step? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1374.48s)]
*  Can you rattle off maybe any resources that might be available to people who [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1380.4s)]
*  don't have them handy? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1384.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1386.24s)]
*  I think when you're a founder, you are likely a person who has identified a problem or been [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1387.38s)]
*  very close to a real problem. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1394.66s)]
*  So you have been close to people who have been affected by the problem, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1397.06s)]
*  have tried to solve the problem, are solving the problem, or might have really good expertise [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1400.5s)]
*  and be unaware of the problem, but you have probably been around those people. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1405.54s)]
*  And so beyond the infrastructure, I think as a founder or as an executive, you have to bring [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1409.14s)]
*  your whole network into the endeavor. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1414.9s)]
*  And so even beyond the Stanford community, my very first job was in biotech. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1418.3400000000001s)]
*  I was actually in China at BGI Genomics and my boss at BGI Genomics, the head of the health division [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1427.0600000000002s)]
*  at the time, Ko Chin. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1433.22s)]
*  Hi Ko, I'm going to send you this podcast. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1435.0600000000002s)]
*  But now he's a managing director at ESA Innovation and he's been an operator [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1439.14s)]
*  he's been a founder, he's been an investor, he's been the farm aside, he's been on the [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1444.82s)]
*  traditional institutional investor side. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1449.7s)]
*  So he has a lot of experience and I've been so surprised every time I pick up the phone, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1451.62s)]
*  he's like, if he can't talk to me then he calls me back in five minutes and he takes the time. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1457.78s)]
*  He was also one of the people that was looking at Eric's paper telling me like, oh, I have an idea. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1462.8999999999999s)]
*  But he's from a past experience. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1466.74s)]
*  I think biotech is a very complex field. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1471.3s)]
*  You do have to have a reason to be in the position that you're in. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1475.22s)]
*  I think it is really hard and it needs the proper set of experiences around the table. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1479.54s)]
*  So anyone in a founder position or executive position has a set of experiences, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1484.18s)]
*  have to be willing to go back to them. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1488.82s)]
*  So Ko has been like a guardian angel in this process walking me through this how [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1490.18s)]
*  pharma thinks about it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1494.82s)]
*  This is how institutional investors will think about it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1495.86s)]
*  This is how you have to think about it as an operator in his experience. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1498.02s)]
*  Others from my life too, my manager from Gates Foundation also on the phone with her. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1502.26s)]
*  She has a lot of experience. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1506.98s)]
*  I really believe in health equity. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1508.6599999999999s)]
*  So how do we innovate in a way that's scalable? [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1509.86s)]
*  She brings in her deep experience on design. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1512.4199999999998s)]
*  My even my undergrad lab PI, I get on the phone and I call him and see what he thinks about it. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1517.7s)]
*  And he's an innovator in his own right. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1524.6599999999999s)]
*  He discovered he identified GABA as a neurotransmitter. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1525.94s)]
*  He knows how to manage a lab. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1529.06s)]
*  He knows how to paralyze experiments. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1531.62s)]
*  He knows how to take calculated risk. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1534.02s)]
*  And so you can bring all these elements of your life into it. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1535.62s)]
*  You probably are one or two degrees away from somebody who is very deeply [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1539.78s)]
*  experienced in whatever problem you're facing. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1545.94s)]
*  And as the company grows, our network multiplies. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1549.46s)]
*  Everyone at the company comes with very, very deep experience or is highly connected. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1552.42s)]
*  And then you bring on folks like Jim Collins. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1557.3s)]
*  I felt like I needed to pinch myself when Jim agreed to join us as a co-founder because [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1559.06s)]
*  he's the father of synthetic biology. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1563.86s)]
*  And he either knows it better than anyone else or he can point us to the best expert. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1566.1s)]
*  So yes, your network multiplies and you have to be willing to use it. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1572.82s)]
*  Not afraid, right? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1579.46s)]
*  You have to put yourself out there. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1580.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean, that network growth, we could belabor that the whole [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1583.1399999999999s)]
*  point. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1588.02s)]
*  I want to get to the science. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1588.26s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1589.46s)]
*  But I will say that the growth of the network doesn't happen unless you, to your point, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1590.1s)]
*  put yourself out there. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1598.8999999999999s)]
*  Sophia, I mean, I mentioned from the outset, has public, private, nonprofit, academic experience. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1599.54s)]
*  Every single one of those experiences that you've had along the way has expanded [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1606.6599999999999s)]
*  that network and you find yourself. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1610.26s)]
*  I could look at it and go, well, I mean, Sophia brought those perspectives herself. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1612.5s)]
*  She worked in all these places, but then it's the extension of that to the network. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1617.22s)]
*  I mean, that's also being generous too, right? [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1621.86s)]
*  I mean, everybody was generous with you and you will go on as well, hopefully. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1624.1s)]
*  And you are doing that right now, right? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1629.3s)]
*  By also being generous with your knowledge. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1630.9s)]
*  And that's how medicines are made too. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1633.62s)]
*  I mean, it's from a place of trying to improve access and make medicines for patients. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1636.58s)]
*  But from a leadership perspective, it's the exact same thing, right? [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1641.14s)]
*  And the quality of decision-making, every decision in our industry is so expensive. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1644.5s)]
*  The quality of the decision has to be really high. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1648.5s)]
*  And so anyone, it doesn't matter if you're super experienced, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1652.5s)]
*  I think everybody is best served by trying to gather as many perspectives as possible. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1655.3s)]
*  It's our jobs as executives to synthesize that information and then make a calculated decision. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1659.1399999999999s)]
*  But make the decision is our viewpoint. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1666.18s)]
*  But yeah. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1669.3s)]
*  It's a beautiful segue because decision-making in this particular space is, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1670.74s)]
*  especially Vexen, really exacerbated. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1676.9s)]
*  Like we're not making monoclonal antibodies here. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1680.02s)]
*  We're working in science that is changing all the time. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1682.02s)]
*  Influences are changing all the time. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1684.5s)]
*  So start talking about that a little bit. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1685.94s)]
*  As you guys formed up this scientific concept and translated it to a business, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1688.02s)]
*  obviously you don't do that without paying attention to what's going on around you in [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1695.14s)]
*  this particular space. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1698.18s)]
*  How have your perspectives on the RNA space at large on where it's going, what it needs? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1699.7s)]
*  I'd be really curious to hear just your sort of take on where the space has come from and where [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1708.98s)]
*  you see it going broadly, kind of removed from your company at this moment. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1715.62s)]
*  Where are some of the big trends you're seeing that space moving towards [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1720.1s)]
*  and what are you most excited about or what are you most perhaps anxious [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1723.86s)]
*  about? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1729.22s)]
*  That's not what I was going to ask you. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1729.38s)]
*  I told you I can't be controlled when you put a mic in front of me. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1734.5s)]
*  I think we just asked Sophia and Eric like seven questions or one. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1738.74s)]
*  That's how I do it. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1742.5s)]
*  So pick one. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1743.78s)]
*  The great thing is pick your favorite one. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1744.5s)]
*  Pick your favorite one. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1747.78s)]
*  mRNA has always been excited. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1750.18s)]
*  Like I mentioned, Moderna success has been a long time coming. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1751.54s)]
*  But as I alluded to before, if you just have this print statement, you're just going, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1757.22s)]
*  just making that protein from that mRNA therapeutic, you might be limited to just some, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1761.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm going to say the low hanging fruit. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1767.94s)]
*  Of course, it's a lot of effort to make all these medicines. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1769.22s)]
*  But in terms of the thinking around what you're making and how, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1771.78s)]
*  your application space is limited. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1776.98s)]
*  So you asked us to detangle a little bit from the company, but I do think the most exciting [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1779.54s)]
*  part is being able to say where and when we're making these genetic medicines. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1784.74s)]
*  Ultimately, the proteins that affect the function that are encoded in these mRNAs. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1791.7s)]
*  So having looked at and now lived at the mRNA space a bit more in more detail, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1796.02s)]
*  big challenges are still delivery. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1803.78s)]
*  But what's exciting there has been maybe a shift in the business model a little bit. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1805.06s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of companies who are innovating on the delivery space, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1810.18s)]
*  who don't necessarily have the ambition to make therapeutics themselves. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1813.78s)]
*  They want to work with other folks who have other innovations on the mRNA molecule [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1817.78s)]
*  or the disease to go after, and they can provide the vehicle to get there. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1822.34s)]
*  So we're kind of seeing a little bit of progress there and now having the thing you need to [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1826.66s)]
*  encapsulate your stuff in. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1833.46s)]
*  That's very important versus having to now build an RNA company and a delivery company [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1836.1s)]
*  at the same time. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1841.22s)]
*  And that's what we've maybe seen before where there's a lot of mergers, where there's a [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1842.26s)]
*  delivery company and an RNA therapeutics company and they encourage to have more efficiencies. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1846.66s)]
*  But we really see that the delivery vehicles could be reused in other applications by other [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1852.1000000000001s)]
*  people and nobody has the bandwidth to do everything. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1856.9s)]
*  So I think it's exciting to see that this is becoming a bit more usable by other folks [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1860.1000000000001s)]
*  from that perspective. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1867.54s)]
*  At the same time, mRNA has been around for a while. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1868.26s)]
*  There's certain innovations that are coming off patent and I think that can invigorate [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1871.22s)]
*  some innovation or using of these components as well. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1875.14s)]
*  And I think that's exciting. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1878.58s)]
*  mRNA is a platform and these delivery vehicles, they all are platforms and that has benefits [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1881.6200000000001s)]
*  and has challenges as well. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1888.34s)]
*  The FDA has been thinking about the platform regulation quite a bit. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1891.3s)]
*  And I think there are many nuances to really think through there. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1894.42s)]
*  For example, if you think about an mRNA therapeutic, there's three platforms there typically. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1897.3s)]
*  There's the delivery platform, there's the payload platform, the mRNA molecule, and then [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1902.5s)]
*  there's the thing you're encoding. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1905.86s)]
*  Say that it's a genome editor or something like that. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1907.3799999999999s)]
*  Each of those is a platform on its own and could be de-risked in different ways. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1909.3799999999999s)]
*  In the future, I would like to see how do we think about all of these components coming [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1915.54s)]
*  together and really efficiently de-risking all of these components on the regulatory [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1919.06s)]
*  side so that we actually can make the medicines quicker. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1924.8999999999999s)]
*  The promise of these platforms is that we can get to patients quicker so that they [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1927.06s)]
*  can benefit versus having to start from scratch again every time we're making a new therapeutic, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1931.06s)]
*  even though we changed just one aspect or brought together these different components. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1935.3799999999999s)]
*  So that to me is exciting. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1939.62s)]
*  I am still a molecular thinker in my heart. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1941.1399999999999s)]
*  So there's so much interesting molecular biology that's happening being either invented [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1945.06s)]
*  or discovered. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1950.34s)]
*  You know, we are, of course, on the front lines there having used existing biology [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1951.94s)]
*  within cells but also discovered new biology, which has just been exciting because it really [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1956.82s)]
*  can make a difference to patients that currently don't have any treatment options. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1961.46s)]
*  That's my take. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1965.54s)]
*  I was going to say, Sophia, too, you can kind of build on that as well in terms of how are [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1967.7s)]
*  you seeing some of these evolutions that Eric's excited about that are exciting you, right, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1972.74s)]
*  that are kind of shaping how you anticipate you would like to shape your own strategy, [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1977.86s)]
*  right, as you're entering the space as a brand new company and trying to carve your own niche. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1983.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1988.02s)]
*  I'll say a few of the same things Eric said and in maybe a different way. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1989.3s)]
*  The way that we see the delivery space evolving is right now many companies are solving either [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=1993.3799999999999s)]
*  one or two questions. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2000.1799999999998s)]
*  It is biasing these vectors towards new tissues so that they don't all just sink in the liver. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2001.9399999999998s)]
*  And or targeting as well. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2008.82s)]
*  So I think it's understood if we want to move towards in vivo programming or in vivo use of [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2011.9399999999998s)]
*  genetic medicines, we need to get it into the right tissues and we need it to get into the right [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2016.74s)]
*  cells or really only be active in the right cells. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2024.34s)]
*  So there's biasing and there's specificity. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2027.6999999999998s)]
*  And I think that there's a lot of progress on the biasing front. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2029.9399999999998s)]
*  And I think specificity by modulating just the vector has been very hard for many reasons. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2034.02s)]
*  We have an op-ed on Cell and Gene so go read it. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2041.6200000000001s)]
*  That's a great plug. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2043.46s)]
*  Yes, I know it's related. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2046.02s)]
*  So for many reasons has been very hard. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2048.02s)]
*  And so we at Radar think about this in a whole different way. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2052.42s)]
*  We think we want to read the universal code of the cell and we really believe the RNA [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2056.1s)]
*  profile is the universal code. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2061.78s)]
*  It is the information that tells you how static genes, so static DNA, that's the same in all [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2063.7799999999997s)]
*  cells, is translated into the dynamic protein profiles that are really driving individual cell [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2068.8199999999997s)]
*  behavior. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2073.9399999999996s)]
*  So if you can read this RNA profile, the AUCGs that make it up, you can really be reading that [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2074.66s)]
*  universal code that tells you what the cell is doing. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2080.8199999999997s)]
*  Why don't we use that code to find specificity? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2084.1s)]
*  Why don't we use that code to tell us exactly what cell we're in or what that cell is doing [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2088.74s)]
*  that makes it our target of interest? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2094.18s)]
*  So we like to think about it a whole different way. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2097.7799999999997s)]
*  Instead of making your vector find a cell surface marker that potentially defines a cell type, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2099.46s)]
*  might be shared by others, let's think about it just reading the code. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2107.3799999999997s)]
*  Let's read the code straight. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2110.18s)]
*  And so it's very clear the entire field is thinking about this. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2113.14s)]
*  It's thinking about in vivo, going in vivo. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2117.94s)]
*  That is the way that we're going to make these genetic medicines scalable. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2120.82s)]
*  That's the way that we're going to make them cost effective. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2123.94s)]
*  That's the way that you're going to be able to take them from just being able to be delivered [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2126.1s)]
*  at very specialized academic centers to clinics that can do just IV transfusions or subcutaneous [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2130.58s)]
*  injection to modes of administration that can be available to more patients. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2139.3s)]
*  It's the way you're going to drive down cost. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2143.14s)]
*  Everyone is thinking about taking things in vivo. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2145.06s)]
*  It's the next frontier. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2146.98s)]
*  To do that, you need to have exquisite specificity, particularly to get at very complex, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2148.58s)]
*  high burden indications that affect broad populations. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2154.9s)]
*  And that's why we at Radar, and I want to say, if you, when you found a business, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2160.1s)]
*  you can take your values and make them into strategy. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2163.54s)]
*  And our strategy really is to make medicines for all people, as many people as possible. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2166.34s)]
*  We have to have design criteria that say, we're going to innovate in a way that makes [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2172.58s)]
*  a step change in safety and a step change in accessibility. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2176.66s)]
*  And that means we have to drive down costs. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2179.94s)]
*  We have to do this in vivo. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2181.38s)]
*  We have to be able to target diseases that are affecting broader populations. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2183.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'll say, this is a shift. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2187.7s)]
*  I think about, you know, five, six years ago, I was in China actually still. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2190.1s)]
*  And I remember giving a presentation on the promise of CRISPR-Cas9. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2196.02s)]
*  But at the end of that presentation on the technological promise, there was still an [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2200.1s)]
*  understanding that this would be a technological feat to most patients affected by diseases they [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2205.14s)]
*  were going after. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2210.42s)]
*  And, you know, I think CasGiabbi is a huge, it's a huge success that we have. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2211.7799999999997s)]
*  CasGiabbi approved now for sickle cell disease. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2216.3399999999997s)]
*  Most, but sickle cell affects African Americans, Africans at a higher rate. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2218.58s)]
*  Are they going to be able to access a medicine that it's, you know, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2224.98s)]
*  on average, $2.1 million or more that has to be delivered at an academic center where you have [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2228.02s)]
*  to have your cells removed from the body, isolated, re-engineered, put back into the [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2235.06s)]
*  body 30 days later, and then potentially have time in the ICU? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2240.02s)]
*  Oftentimes the hospitalization costs have the cost of that treatment. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2244.02s)]
*  And that's just not going to be accessible for most people. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2247.06s)]
*  It elucidates a lot of biology. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2249.94s)]
*  It makes us know that it could be possible to move forward. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2252.02s)]
*  But I think everyone knows we have to bring it in vivo. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2254.74s)]
*  Same for the very promising CAR T therapies. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2258.9799999999996s)]
*  Also, when I was in China, I was on a, I was, I wasn't always in China, but it just happens [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2261.7799999999997s)]
*  that a lot. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2265.3799999999997s)]
*  But I was on a panel, a, you know, through the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2267.06s)]
*  there was a panel between Chinese regulators and U.S. regulators talking about CAR T, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2272.74s)]
*  the promise of CAR T. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2276.66s)]
*  I think there was, there was a, almost a competition between the U.S. and China at the time. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2278.58s)]
*  I think it's already CAR T trials. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2283.46s)]
*  And, but even then we were talking about this has to be ex vivo today. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2286.02s)]
*  So these are the kinds of patients we can serve, the very, you know, with very severe [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2290.7400000000002s)]
*  cancers. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2295.94s)]
*  There was, you know, this idea that maybe one day it could be in vivo. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2298.42s)]
*  It was just an idea. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2301.1400000000003s)]
*  Now it's a big idea. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2302.58s)]
*  Now people are trying to make it happen. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2303.78s)]
*  And so in vivo is definitely the future. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2305.62s)]
*  That's what we believe at Radar. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2309.3s)]
*  And we believe we have a very, you know, now I'm moving to the Pitch Dorator, but I do [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2310.74s)]
*  think that's the future. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2314.8999999999996s)]
*  The Pitch Dorator is that we really think that you need, if you want to get that exquisite [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2315.7s)]
*  specificity, read the entire code of the cell. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2320.66s)]
*  Read the entire code of the cell and do it in a way that you can make it accessible to [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2324.5s)]
*  people. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2329.3799999999997s)]
*  So think about the cost of the, think about the route administration. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2329.7799999999997s)]
*  And the last part I'll say is that what's also exciting is there's always been this idea, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2333.7799999999997s)]
*  platform versus single asset and platform, platform, platform. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2339.2999999999997s)]
*  And what is a platform technology? [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2342.18s)]
*  To be a platform technology, you have to be able to develop multiple products from a similar [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2344.1s)]
*  concept. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2348.1s)]
*  And I think, you know, at the end of the day, what matters to patients, what matters to [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2350.34s)]
*  pharma, what matters to VCs is the eventual quality of the product you do. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2355.94s)]
*  And the promise of the platform is that you could generate one product, then multiple [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2360.66s)]
*  products after that. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2364.74s)]
*  And I think with Moderna, we have this first products, the code vaccine, the RSV vaccine [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2366.8199999999997s)]
*  and the promise of more. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2372.8999999999996s)]
*  You're starting to actually see platforms fulfill the platform promise, which is high [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2374.2599999999998s)]
*  quality products staged. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2379.94s)]
*  That's also what we think is very promising at Radar. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2383.14s)]
*  We want to form high quality products. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2385.46s)]
*  We really believe that if we do that, we can actually build a platform that's going to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2386.8199999999997s)]
*  be a high quality product. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2390.18s)]
*  We believe that if we get it right the first time, those wins will translate to more medicines. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2391.14s)]
*  So I still think that there's a lot of promise in platform as long as we make high quality [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2397.2999999999997s)]
*  products. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2400.8999999999996s)]
*  Well, I asked the last question and you said I asked the wrong question, apparently. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2405.94s)]
*  So, look up. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2411.94s)]
*  Once again, once again, I'm offended. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2413.14s)]
*  It's your turn, Matt. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2417.54s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2418.74s)]
*  We're going to run short on time. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2420.18s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2423.62s)]
*  We're going to have to motor and then we'll have to do a part two of Sophie. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2424.66s)]
*  I know. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2428.58s)]
*  I know you guys are going to have to come back. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2429.14s)]
*  So I could go one of two ways with this. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2431.22s)]
*  The platform conversation that you just started, Sophia, I'm curious about, and this is sort [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2434.98s)]
*  of maybe skipping to the end. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2441.06s)]
*  On my normal story arc on the business of biotech, might be skipping to the end. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2443.7799999999997s)]
*  We'll backpedal if we need to. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2447.3799999999997s)]
*  But can you share any thoughts on early thoughts on what a potential pipeline might look like [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2449.54s)]
*  for radar therapeutics? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2456.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2457.78s)]
*  I don't mean to paint you in the corner or ask you to say anything that your board is [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2459.46s)]
*  going to be upset with you for saying, but to the degree that you can share. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2463.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2468.66s)]
*  For us, our pipeline, we really think about where can we create a step change in safety [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2469.86s)]
*  and a step change in accessibility and where do we have the potential to be first in class. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2474.7400000000002s)]
*  These are guiding for us. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2479.46s)]
*  We are looking at very complex high burden diseases. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2481.54s)]
*  The logic has to be these cell types cannot really be isolated in vivo or targeted in [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2485.2200000000003s)]
*  vivo without an element like radar, without an element that really gets to the universal [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2490.82s)]
*  code and then selectively activates that mRNA, which are the cell types that are currently [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2495.7000000000003s)]
*  inaccessible by other technologies or not able to be truly specifically targeted without [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2500.6600000000003s)]
*  a technology like radar. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2505.7000000000003s)]
*  Those are our guiding principles. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2507.86s)]
*  We have identified a few areas as very promising. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2509.54s)]
*  I think I won't mention them, but if you dug in to certain public places, you can [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2513.7799999999997s)]
*  definitely be educated at what we're really excited about. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2519.94s)]
*  I'll say each of these systems, there is always a pipeline behind it because you have this [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2524.66s)]
*  very complex cellular environment. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2528.98s)]
*  Once you make a sensor or a control element for a particular cell type within it, you [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2531.46s)]
*  have a pipeline of products that could come after it because in these complex environments [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2537.54s)]
*  within the body, many things can go wrong. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2541.38s)]
*  You have a complex engine and any of those parts breaks down, you get a disease state. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2543.7799999999997s)]
*  So that's how we thought about it, that there's kind of a franchise, a pipeline behind each [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2548.5s)]
*  of these efforts where we can reuse the components, reuse the learnings, reuse the expertise and [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2552.82s)]
*  capabilities we've built out and really fulfill that platform promise. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2558.02s)]
*  So that's always been kind of a guiding principle as well. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2562.34s)]
*  Do you anticipate that that will down the road ease the regulatory rigors as well, Eric? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2565.94s)]
*  I mean, is that sort of something you're thinking about early on? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2573.14s)]
*  We hope so, yeah. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2576.82s)]
*  And we are always gathering insights from our advisors from their experiences, particularly [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2577.54s)]
*  in the nucleic acid therapeutic space where sometimes, say a mouse model might not make [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2582.26s)]
*  sense because you're dealing with sequence-sequence interactions and you really want to [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2587.78s)]
*  deal with the human versions of these transcripts you're interacting with or other [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2590.74s)]
*  components within the cell. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2597.4599999999996s)]
*  So we're looking to see how have other companies addressed this challenge, maybe working really [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2598.66s)]
*  heavily in primary cells and then maybe doing an NHP safety study to prove to the regulators [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2603.8599999999997s)]
*  that this is safe. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2609.54s)]
*  But then convincing yourself on the efficacy side, mostly with primary cell data, looking [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2611.22s)]
*  at actually donors, patient cells and seeing how your mechanisms work there. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2615.7799999999997s)]
*  So by working in similar systems, it can help us accumulate this data on safety and performance. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2620.8199999999997s)]
*  And I hope that this can lead to acceleration in the path to approval. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2627.54s)]
*  As you start thinking about building pipelines and working toward the clinic and eventually [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2635.7799999999997s)]
*  entering the clinic, obviously that's where things start to get very expensive for new [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2641.7s)]
*  biotechs. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2646.66s)]
*  So I'm curious about what you're seeing out there on the funding scene specific to mRNA [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2647.7s)]
*  in the RNA space because every modality has its nuance. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2654.02s)]
*  Right. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2659.2999999999997s)]
*  So are you seeing any specific trends in the RNA funding space and how are you leveraging [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2659.62s)]
*  them and what's that kind of looking like for radar? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2668.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2670.42s)]
*  So I'll say in the RNA space, there is both still a very high level of optimism coming [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2670.74s)]
*  straight off of the pandemic. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2679.62s)]
*  At the same time, there is a good level of caution as well because I think it took 10 [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2681.46s)]
*  years for Moderna to build their platform before they were able to get a product out [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2687.62s)]
*  there. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2692.02s)]
*  So there is a good healthy level of caution. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2692.3399999999997s)]
*  I think investors are getting more and more sophisticated. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2695.94s)]
*  I think you still see a lot of excitement from Pharma as well in the mRNA space. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2699.14s)]
*  So Pharma is always a good investor because they really had a very sophisticated VC tell [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2706.8199999999997s)]
*  me before that in the bad funding environments that there have been in the past and there [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2714.8999999999996s)]
*  have been. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2719.8599999999997s)]
*  We're in one now and there have been in the past as well. [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2721.8599999999997s)]
*  Pharma continues to have a strategic interest in making sure that their future pipeline [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2724.74s)]
*  is getting taken care of. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2729.46s)]
*  And so at this time, Pharma is investing a lot of money. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2731.06s)]
*  A lot of their deals are going earlier and they're going in first in class. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2736.34s)]
*  New modalities, they're investing in mRNA. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2741.3s)]
*  They're investing in genetic medicines a lot. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2744.42s)]
*  So you still have a lot of funding available. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2746.34s)]
*  I will say as a general trend for those in the mRNA space, you do have to have data. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2750.34s)]
*  The bar for data now is higher. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2757.0600000000004s)]
*  It's also a very complex space for IP. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2759.0600000000004s)]
*  So I think for anyone in the mRNA space, yes, I still think it's trendy with a lot of caution [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2763.5400000000004s)]
*  around those working in mRNA. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2772.6600000000003s)]
*  There are very known problems that the entire industry still needs to solve for mRNA. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2774.82s)]
*  But you have to have the best people around the table. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2780.6600000000003s)]
*  You have to. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2784.26s)]
*  We haven't mentioned Ramesh Subramanian is also one of our new advisors and he was [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  former CEO and founder of Asidion and many other RNA companies. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2789.38s)]
*  You have to show that the best people in RNA are there to support and believe in this mission. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2793.78s)]
*  You have to build confidence with investors that way. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2798.6600000000003s)]
*  You have to have good technology. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2802.1800000000003s)]
*  Technology is both you have to show that you've done something breakthrough, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2803.7799999999997s)]
*  something actually meaningful in order to have the right to start a company. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2809.7799999999997s)]
*  There are different ways to prove that. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2815.46s)]
*  We like to prove that through showing that Pharma cared about our technology. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2816.5s)]
*  And we'll say that's why Eric Kaldich made our Shemariputics because we kept winning [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2820.74s)]
*  all these awards from Pharma and so posting our name out there. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2823.7799999999997s)]
*  So we were self but people kept putting our name out there so people kind of knew who we were. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2827.38s)]
*  But you have to show that people think that sophisticated investors and sophisticated [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2831.7799999999997s)]
*  strategic partners think this is a breakthrough. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2837.8599999999997s)]
*  You have to have a moat usually around IP. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2839.9399999999996s)]
*  So your IP has to be very strong, differentiated novel. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2842.3399999999997s)]
*  You're making guesses as to whether you're making guesses as to how the [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2845.7799999999997s)]
*  Patanofin is going to view this, but you have to have a strong educated guess. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2849.62s)]
*  And the business matters. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2854.2599999999998s)]
*  So the application will really matter. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2855.7s)]
*  Of course, at the end of the day, it's all about the patient. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2858.2599999999998s)]
*  But at the end of the day, you have to produce a high quality product that can compete with [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2860.9s)]
*  other modalities with small molecules, biologic, whatever it is. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2865.7000000000003s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's going to come down to the fundamentals. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2870.5s)]
*  Whether you exit via M&A or you exit via IPO, those fundamentals will really matter as to [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2872.82s)]
*  how you are assessed and the excitement you're able to generate. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2879.14s)]
*  And investors have to know that. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2881.7000000000003s)]
*  And so I think the most important decision you can make as a platform, which I think [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2883.78s)]
*  M&A companies are, is where you point the platform first. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2888.42s)]
*  I was going to ask, in terms of investment, I think as the space is moving forward, we are, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2892.42s)]
*  as you said, we're moving towards in vivo, applications of medicines that have to date [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2899.14s)]
*  been autologous. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2904.1s)]
*  We're trying to transition into the therapeutic approach as opposed to just prophylactic [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2905.38s)]
*  vaccination. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2912.02s)]
*  Are you finding as you're talking to investors that the excitement is predominantly there for [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2913.62s)]
*  M&A as this broad technology, as one that has been proven within the vaccination space, but [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2920.66s)]
*  there's caution on the therapeutics front? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2926.74s)]
*  Or are you finding that we're kind of, oh, vaccination's old hat, now it's therapeutics, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2929.7s)]
*  this is hot, this is the exciting trend? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2935.2999999999997s)]
*  And are there areas that that narrative needs to be reshaped? [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2938.58s)]
*  Or that you're educating on the role of M&A in therapeutics as opposed to vaccines? [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2942.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2949.7s)]
*  So that is a great question. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2950.58s)]
*  I think that there is both. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2952.02s)]
*  There is both a lot of caution around, can we actually apply this beyond vaccines? [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2954.82s)]
*  I mean, this is the same kind of, we thought about this in case two, we were very excited that [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2959.78s)]
*  the promise is you can move into other therapeutic areas beyond vaccines. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2964.02s)]
*  Vaccines are very important too. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2968.18s)]
*  But there are some, we think could be features that are specific to M&A. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2969.86s)]
*  For example, it's transience, where you have to be very clear about which indications is transience [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2976.9s)]
*  a feature, which indications do not need a permanent change like you have with DNA editing [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2984.42s)]
*  techniques. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2991.3s)]
*  At Radar, we do believe that there are indications where you do want, in case a mistake is made, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2992.82s)]
*  a mistake is made, or you want that washed out, you don't want that change in all of [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=2998.5s)]
*  your daughter cells. [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3002.66s)]
*  You can make the reset at the RNA level and don't need the permanence. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3003.78s)]
*  So you have to be very clear on the transient story. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3007.7s)]
*  You have to be very clear on how you're going to be expressing enough protein to get the [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3010.1s)]
*  effect that you want. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3014.1s)]
*  And you have to be very clear about specificity, of course, as well. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3017.3s)]
*  So there are parts of the mRNA story that investors are very cued in on. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3021.22s)]
*  You will always get that question on transience. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3025.3s)]
*  You'll always get that question on level of output. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3026.9s)]
*  You'll get the question on specificity. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3028.9s)]
*  You'll get the question on immunogenicity. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3031.2200000000003s)]
*  These are also questions that the vaccine developers had to answer, too. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3033.78s)]
*  But you have to be very ready to answer those questions and include them in your hypothesis [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3039.3s)]
*  as to which indications are currently available or will become available based on the rate of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3044.5s)]
*  progress in the field. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3050.02s)]
*  You referenced earlier some of the perhaps premature recognition you were getting from [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3050.98s)]
*  Pharma prior to your official launches radar, right? [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3058.98s)]
*  When you had the... [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3061.94s)]
*  Schmedar. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3062.66s)]
*  Schmedar. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3063.14s)]
*  Schmedar. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3063.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3063.78s)]
*  And that's... [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3065.78s)]
*  I mean, I mentioned from the outset you're attracting the attention of some heavy hitters. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3066.42s)]
*  I mean, you've won some awards. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3071.14s)]
*  The Avvy Golden Ticket Award, the J&J West Coast Cell and Gene Therapy Symposium Award, [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3072.9s)]
*  even the Amgen Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Award, which maybe not directly [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3078.42s)]
*  related to the science, but is still awesome and important. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3082.9s)]
*  I'm curious about... [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3087.14s)]
*  I've got a number of questions about that. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3089.38s)]
*  We could probably go long on. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3090.7400000000002s)]
*  One, how do you balance that when you're trying to fly under the, I want to quote, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3091.78s)]
*  radars? [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3095.78s)]
*  But then how do those early acknowledgments sort of propel and create momentum for a [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3097.94s)]
*  company that's at your stage? [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3102.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3105.14s)]
*  And we'll mention Eli Lilly is also an equity investor in the company. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3105.38s)]
*  And we have other pharma that we can't openly talk about that we are very familiar with. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3109.62s)]
*  But one, we have been so excited that as the first person recruited to radar, Eric recruited me, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3114.26s)]
*  I'm so excited that others share the idea that this is an important vision. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3121.62s)]
*  And as to the momentum, the great thing about pharma is they are a very sophisticated investor [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3127.62s)]
*  where... And where VCs go very broad, pharma goes broad and deep. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3133.22s)]
*  They have people that are really working on every part of the process that you will have to work on, [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3139.22s)]
*  entering the clinic, getting through regulatory approval. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3145.54s)]
*  They really understand patient populations. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3148.18s)]
*  They have probably diligent a lot of similar technologies. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3150.1s)]
*  They've maybe tried them out in-house. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3153.54s)]
*  And so I think the pharma, what these mentions did to us and what these relationships bring, [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3155.54s)]
*  one is in early stage therapeutics, you don't really have a go to market motion. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3161.78s)]
*  You can't really test directly with your eventual customer, which is the patient as to whether this [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3165.78s)]
*  is going to work. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3172.58s)]
*  You do have to show an investor that the idea is breakthrough and it's worth putting so much [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3174.02s)]
*  capital into because it's going to create a product that will be higher quality than others. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3178.82s)]
*  And breakthrough means it's a combination of... This has never been done before. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3182.26s)]
*  Nothing else can really catch up to us. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3186.5800000000004s)]
*  People don't like competition in biotech because it's just too expensive. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3188.5s)]
*  We have a unique know-how. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3192.5800000000004s)]
*  We have unique know-how. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3195.38s)]
*  We have unique IP that will help us build a moat and pharma will be very good at diligently this. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3196.34s)]
*  They'll be very good at understanding the landscape of other technologies. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3202.7400000000002s)]
*  It also has been super helpful in helping us do customer discovery because they just hold a lot [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3206.8999999999996s)]
*  of information. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3212.02s)]
*  And so I think the earliest you can start talking to people with regulatory experience, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3214.02s)]
*  start talking to clinicians and start talking to pharma because they will know the performance [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3220.4199999999996s)]
*  metrics that will show that your technology is doing well. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3224.1s)]
*  And so I think that's a great way to start talking to people with regulatory experience. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3227.3799999999997s)]
*  And so I think that's a great way to start talking to people with regulatory experience. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3231.22s)]
*  They will have opinions on the best translation models, the best animal models. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3234.98s)]
*  They will even have opinions on what experiments they need to see that really tell the story. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3241.7000000000003s)]
*  You don't want to get these wrong. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3246.5s)]
*  You don't want to have to go back and do them again. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3247.46s)]
*  So I think it's part of this really deep customer discovery process to get those [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3250.1800000000003s)]
*  relationships with pharma going. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3254.82s)]
*  They are very willing to guide you if they're interested in your technology on how to make [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3256.26s)]
*  the best technology possible in the fastest way. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3263.06s)]
*  They have a strategic interest. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3265.22s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3266.34s)]
*  And Rose, have you noticed that Dr. Kassanet has been demonstrating his roll up his sleeves [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3268.18s)]
*  and get it on attitude, whatever it takes every time the lights start to dim and remember [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3274.58s)]
*  while Sophia's talking, he starts rolling around in his chair to get the lights to come back on. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3280.42s)]
*  Like this guy, that's some real partnership going on. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3285.7799999999997s)]
*  It's a demonstration. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3289.46s)]
*  It's a demonstration. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3290.82s)]
*  Meanwhile, I'm shouting questions over you. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3292.26s)]
*  Partnerships of all different styles. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3298.1000000000004s)]
*  I yield the microphone to you. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3299.5400000000004s)]
*  Last question that we do need to wrap things up. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3302.34s)]
*  Although this is, I'm hoping, the first of many conversations with the two of you. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3304.42s)]
*  I've enjoyed it and there's a lot to learn here. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3308.7400000000002s)]
*  You guys have been, you were talking earlier about the responsibility of [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3311.78s)]
*  responsible biotech leaders to sow seeds, to share, right? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3320.82s)]
*  And I think this generosity, the conversation has demonstrated that about Sophia. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3325.3s)]
*  Oh, 100%. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3330.26s)]
*  So I appreciate that. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3332.02s)]
*  I'd love to have you back. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3333.06s)]
*  But for now, I'm looking for some thoughts on what's on the immediate horizon for you to [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3333.94s)]
*  both personally, I mean, too personally, but in your... [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3339.94s)]
*  Where are you going on vacation? [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3344.58s)]
*  Who's going to be there? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3347.78s)]
*  No one's allowed to go on vacation. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3349.54s)]
*  There's no vacation. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3351.86s)]
*  No vacations. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3353.14s)]
*  But in your capacities, in your roles there, then what's on the immediate horizon for Radar itself? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3354.5s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3363.2200000000003s)]
*  Sophia can roll around and keep the lights on. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3365.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's her turn. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3367.2200000000003s)]
*  It's growing and resourcing the team to and reducing the barriers and friction [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3369.46s)]
*  for executing on the science. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3377.14s)]
*  We have uncovered a lot of unique and exciting things related to RNA biology and there's a lot [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3378.74s)]
*  to chase down to make therapeutics better. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3384.74s)]
*  But especially as we start switching from the research to the development side, that's my [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3388.5s)]
*  main goal is to make sure we have bring in the right people that we need and reduce [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3393.86s)]
*  any friction to get things done and get the science rolling and move forward. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3399.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3406.1s)]
*  I lied. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3406.58s)]
*  Not last question because follow up to that, Eric. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3407.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you relish that role? [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3411.1400000000003s)]
*  Do you find that role refreshing compared to sort of like, okay, I've been holding down the [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3412.02s)]
*  Ford on the science side, now I get to play, you know, founder or is it foreign to you? [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3418.82s)]
*  It's definitely been an evolution and that's why I spent so much time talking with other [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3425.6200000000003s)]
*  founders to see what's in store. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3430.98s)]
*  I'm listening to your podcast on my drives for Berkeley to Stanford. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3432.5800000000004s)]
*  To see what's up ahead, I like to use metaphor like there's a road, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3437.38s)]
*  but I want to know where the potholes are. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3441.1400000000003s)]
*  Can I steer around them? [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3444.02s)]
*  It's a challenge to understand what is in store and I do think the job changes, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3445.86s)]
*  not quite every day, but week to week and certainly month to month as we go and take on [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3450.7400000000002s)]
*  new things that we need to do to make the medicine. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3457.06s)]
*  So it's been exciting. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3459.3s)]
*  I've learned just so much. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3461.38s)]
*  Whenever I do have some free time, I like to do it all on new molecular designs and things like [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3464.26s)]
*  that. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3468.58s)]
*  But at this point in the company, we're moving and getting more serious about [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3468.7400000000002s)]
*  our individual projects and the things we're going after. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3474.1s)]
*  So that's an evolving process, of course, and it is a different mindset. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3478.58s)]
*  My grad school experience was very different. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3484.18s)]
*  All the experiences before that were very different. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3487.38s)]
*  I'm sure every company is a little bit unique and different as well, depending on the problems [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3491.86s)]
*  you're tackling, the team you have around you. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3496.18s)]
*  It's a new challenge. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3501.54s)]
*  Yeah, it's a new challenge. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3502.74s)]
*  You'll never be bored. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3504.8999999999996s)]
*  Never. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3507.7799999999997s)]
*  That's a foreign word. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3508.1s)]
*  Sophia, how about you? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3510.18s)]
*  What's on your immediate horizon? [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3510.9799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, immediate horizon, it is pretty much all about radar right now. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3514.2599999999998s)]
*  Even in my personal interactions, it's about radar. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3519.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, and you really love a mission, you're thinking about it at the grocery store, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3522.2599999999998s)]
*  you're thinking about it at your party, you're trying to tell your friends about [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3525.7799999999997s)]
*  in vivo programmability and they're like, what's that? [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3528.2599999999998s)]
*  You're a real hit at the cocktail parties, I'm sure. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3532.74s)]
*  I did want to take a chance to thank everyone on the radar team. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3537.8599999999997s)]
*  Every employee at radar has taken a risk on this idea and really believes in the mission. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3542.66s)]
*  We hope that this is the opportunity of a lifetime for everyone here to change the world. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3547.54s)]
*  So we want to thank our team. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3551.9399999999996s)]
*  When we say recruit the best people in the world, it includes everybody at radar. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3554.1s)]
*  So other employers do not try to steal them, but they're all [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3557.7799999999997s)]
*  approved great people who work at radar therapeutics. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3561.7s)]
*  There is at radar, now that we're moving, [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3566.18s)]
*  a couple months that we can move a bit away from fundraising because that's [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3570.02s)]
*  that really is always the job, but there is more active management, the team is growing. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3572.74s)]
*  We're also moving, we'll have a research function, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3578.1s)]
*  but we're moving more towards a development function as well. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3580.66s)]
*  And so it takes a different style of thinking, a different way of parallelizing experiments. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3583.22s)]
*  And Eric and I have to make sure that everyone is really aligned on how we're moving towards [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3589.62s)]
*  where we're going. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3594.66s)]
*  So there is, I look forward to that too, spending more time actively with the team, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3596.8199999999997s)]
*  thinking about these problems. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3601.2999999999997s)]
*  And then on the related side, I think right now there are a lot of government policies [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3603.2999999999997s)]
*  and rulings that are very consequential for our industry. [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3609.14s)]
*  And these have always been on my mind. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3614.02s)]
*  I've written about them before on, you know, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3615.86s)]
*  biomedical innovation cannot be involved in geopolitical warfare or domestic, you know, [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3619.54s)]
*  fights. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3626.1s)]
*  It's not worth it. [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3626.6600000000003s)]
*  It's our mission's too important. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3628.02s)]
*  And so I hope to get more involved there from the position that we're in. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3630.42s)]
*  And I think all biotech executives need to make their voice heard right now [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3634.5s)]
*  on how some of these policy changes could be affecting our industry. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3638.1800000000003s)]
*  You just unbeknownst to you, perhaps you just planted the seed for our next podcast discussion. [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3642.26s)]
*  Whether or not Dr. Cassidy wants to join that one, I don't know. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3648.1000000000004s)]
*  But we're going to plan that one out. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3652.5s)]
*  Really appreciate you guys coming on the podcast. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3659.3s)]
*  I'm going to link to that op-ed that you referenced on Sal and Jean in the show notes [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3660.9s)]
*  since Sal and Jean's a great friend of ours. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3665.1400000000003s)]
*  So we'll link to that. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3669.2200000000003s)]
*  But keep an eye on Radar Therapeutics, Sophia, Dr. Cassinet. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3670.6600000000003s)]

*  We probably should have asked that. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3677.86s)]
*  Yeah, Eric didn't talk about the Estonian folk dances that came before the 2012 CRISPR paper. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3681.94s)]

*  Dr. Cassinet, however you say it is just fine. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3692.74s)]
*  My mom calls me Eric, my wife calls me E. Eric. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3704.02s)]
*  If you're Googling Dr. Cassinet, know that there are two Es and it's spelled with a CK. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3711.62s)]
*  It's spelled with a K. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3717.62s)]
*  Just a K. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3719.54s)]
*  You're really, yeah, we got to cut. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPl0IzgDMkY&t=3721.7799999999997s)]
