Video Description: Multimodal approaches to the delivery of radiologically active compounds have created a fertile environment to for players in the space to put on a precision medicine clinic, so to speak. What’s more, Radiopharmaceuticals create a unique business opportunity given the closely-related and necessary companion diagnostic arena. On today’s episode of the Business of Biotech, recorded in San Francisco, we sit down with Dr. Mark Hoppin, CEO of Ratio Therapeutics, a company that’s well-positioned in the space with a fresh Series B and the foundation of a tunable radiotherapeutic that Dr. Hoppin says addresses the delivery, safety and efficacy challenges long associated with radiopharmaceuticals in the treatment of solid cancers. We also discuss how this mathemetician-turned biotech CEO has navigated the leadership of boards, employees, and investors on his journey.

*  business of biotech recorded in San Francisco, I'm sitting down with Dr. Jack Hoppen, CEO of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Ratio Therapeutics, a company that's well positioned in the space with a fresh series B, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=75.60000000000001s)]

*  We came here to talk about ratio therapeutics. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=95.28s)]
*  We did. And ratio therapeutics is interesting to me personally, and to the podcast. I mean, we're [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=97.12s)]
*  180 plus episodes deep into this thing, and I maybe have had one or two other radiopharmaceutical [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=103.6s)]
*  companies on maybe, and it was like early days because I couldn't tell you who they are. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=110.32s)]
*  So I'm not like intimately familiar with what's going on in that space. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=114.16s)]
*  Give me a layman before you get into like ratio and why it's better than all the other things. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  You're in for a ride. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=122.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, that's good. I hear that a lot. Tell me a little bit about what the space looks like. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=124.4s)]
*  You may give it a landscape. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=130.0s)]
*  Sure. So the notion of injecting a radioactive drug for the purpose of killing cancer, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=131.2s)]
*  cytotoxic effect is not novel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=139.92s)]
*  Right. And it's not novel or new. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  No. Like, Ion 131, radioactive iodine, was approved by the FDA in 1951, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=147.51999999999998s)]
*  and it's still a standard of care for thyroid cancer and even hypothyroidism, which is [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=154.72s)]
*  biological treatment. There was a couple of good drugs that came out back at the turn of the century [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=159.83999999999997s)]
*  for non-Hawkshians lymphoma, and they were good drugs, but were not economically successful, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=168.56s)]
*  somewhat controversial. And then Bayer came to market with Sofiga, which is radiated chloride [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=176.4s)]
*  for metastatic bone cancer, very akin to the radioactive iodine, which injecting isotope in it [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=184.0s)]
*  just goes, in the case of iodine, to the thyroid, and in the case of radiated chloride, it goes to [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  osteoblasts, the interface of the tumor and bone, and metastatic bone cancer. So [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=196.4s)]
*  it is efficacious to a point. It's also very good in a palliative care sense. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=201.04s)]
*  And then what's happened, then the boom really has been over the last decade, more specifically, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=205.36s)]
*  last five years with Novartis making acquisitions and then getting approval for [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=211.76s)]
*  lutethera for neuroendocrine disease. Its target is somatostatin, and CluVicDo was approved for [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=216.8s)]
*  castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, and that targets PSMA, or prostate-specific [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=225.2s)]
*  membrane antigen. They're very good drugs with very little side effects. And that's why people [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=230.16s)]
*  have just gotten really excited. We've seen the big players come to the market for the last five [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=238.88s)]
*  years. There's been some recent and exciting acquisitions in the space. So I was really [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=243.2s)]
*  interested, as I mentioned in that previous life, working with Sony radiated lip drugs, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=249.76s)]
*  a B in this space, but there really weren't big players in the market. And that's what's needed, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=254.24s)]
*  I think, for the supply side or the distribution and commercial side. We've watched a lot of players [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=260.16s)]
*  come in just in the last year. Eli Lilly made a big acquisition. First, Mark Schwibb just announced [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=267.92s)]
*  a big acquisition to join the likes of already present Novartis, Fire, and we see other big drug [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=273.52s)]
*  companies doing some trials and looking in the space. So that's a big change for the market. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=282.16s)]
*  Yeah. Positive. Really positive because the drugs are good and they're very... [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=289.44s)]
*  I think supply chain was an issue in the past. Manufacturing is always a topic. You're making [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=297.76000000000005s)]
*  something that's decaying. So it's another level of complexity as your shelf life is [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=304.0s)]
*  very short. You're making each batch and releasing it. But those two drugs, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=311.76s)]
*  Luthera and Wicto, really have been a game changer and now we see a huge pipeline [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=320.16s)]
*  of other companies and drugs in the space. So now let's zoom out a little bit and give me [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=324.64s)]
*  some perspective on where radiopharmaceuticals kind of fit in the landscape of small malls, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=331.44s)]
*  traditional biologics, even cell and gene therapies. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=338.16s)]
*  Yeah. So for blood-borne cancers, those two drugs I mentioned, for lymphoma, for non-hyphen [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=341.92s)]
*  lymphoma, those were antibodies. But for solid tumors, while people have tried with antibodies, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=347.12s)]
*  realistically, it's a small molecule sport. You need something with high [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=354.64000000000004s)]
*  capillary permeability tissue to consume. You want to get something up and into the tumor quickly [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=361.04s)]
*  and small molecules best find themselves for that. And you don't want... You are injecting a [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=365.84s)]
*  radioactive material so you don't want long circulating radiation in the body. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  So people have been really going after small molecules and peptides and other [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=377.76s)]
*  types of small molecule. And so we're a small molecule company with a platform that [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=383.03999999999996s)]
*  hitchhikes albumin. So we have very weak binding to albumin as compared to very [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=390.72s)]
*  reverentially very strong binding to the tumor antigen. You're looking for targets that are [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=398.24s)]
*  specific to solid tumors that are highly expressed in that environment. And with very little off [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=404.0s)]
*  target, the efficacy is very predictable. It's really a function of how much radiation-absorbed [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=410.56s)]
*  dose you can get to the tumor in a given dosing cycle as compared to what would be your off target [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=418.48s)]
*  dosing. So it's that ratio. The area under the curve, those relative regions of interest are [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  where you define your therapeutic efficacy, your therapeutic window. And so the great hope of this [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  class of drug is very often as a replacement for hemotherapeutics. The side effects are much lower, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=438.88s)]
*  to no impact on the immune system depending on the drug. So not born out yet, but as we've really [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=446.47999999999996s)]
*  been focusing on signaling and efficacy, but the great hope is that these in combination with [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=452.64s)]
*  disruptive because most people don't feel much or any effect of the drug. There can be if you [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=459.44s)]
*  you know they... But you don't have a ratio. Well radioactivity is not selective. We use [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=467.12s)]
*  two types of emitters, beta or alphas. Beta's are like how many alphas are in the nuclei. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=474.16s)]
*  One is literally 8,000 times bigger than the other. They have different properties and there's [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=480.16s)]
*  different isotopes that can be used. But then from that you can calculate sort of what is [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  the right isotope for that drug. We're really learning now what are the trade-offs of all of these. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=489.92s)]
*  So Novartis is an emerging biotech, a small biotech. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=497.28s)]
*  That goes without saying, one of the differentiators being you've got to raise money. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=514.16s)]
*  Not that they don't, but the resources are a little thicker. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=520.64s)]
*  Novartis is a different economic position. That's a very eloquent way to say what else to say. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=523.92s)]
*  And it's as we all know super competitive and difficult and difficult for a couple of years now. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=531.6s)]
*  So I guess that's my next line of question. I'm curious about what the investment appetite [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=538.08s)]
*  looks like. It's easy for a person in the position of industry observer to get spun up in [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=544.32s)]
*  anything RNA or get spun up in anything ATMP cell and gene therapies or get caught up in the [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=554.88s)]
*  excitement around ADCs. So I know what the investment appetite looks like there. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=563.2s)]
*  What does it look like for radiopharmaceuticals? It has been really strong. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=569.92s)]
*  It's been the last two years of VC investing in the space have been somewhat frozen. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=575.28s)]
*  Not radiopharmaceuticals, just our space in general. 2023 being down here with forecasted [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=583.36s)]
*  thawing. Lots of market economics have got us into that position. We've yet to have an [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=589.76s)]
*  institutional investor in the company. The company was founded following a transaction with [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=596.64s)]
*  buyer pharmaceuticals. And part of that was a strategic alliance to start work on one drug [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=607.76s)]
*  that they had acquired when they acquired Nouria and PSMA Therapeutics, which I should add was [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=613.28s)]
*  really the trigger of the founding of ratio. John Babish, who was the founder of that company, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=618.8s)]
*  hadn't reached out to me to study the pharmacokinetics of this platform, which I [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=624.08s)]
*  immediately fell in love with the Smith for purpose rating pharmaceutical. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=632.1600000000001s)]
*  And so we really seeded the company through the couple of non-dilutive deals and then just [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=636.0s)]
*  from seed capital, we did a series A last year, all large scale family offices and with [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=641.6800000000001s)]
*  insiders. And then we just closed the series B, which we won't announce until next week. So it's [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=649.4399999999999s)]
*  right when you're playing this podcast, but it'll be after next week. That's what I figured. Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=656.16s)]
*  And so at that time, you will have heard of the news. It'll be known that we raised, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=660.4s)]
*  we closed the series B at the end of last year for $50 million, about half existing shareholders, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=666.0s)]
*  half new. We did not have many classic VCs in that round either. We did have a strategic and [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=671.68s)]
*  another large scale family office. So it's been going well. I think the appetite for [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=683.76s)]
*  reading pharmaceuticals is high in the marketplace. So it's always hard to know what [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=693.68s)]
*  we're a private company and free money valuations. I would say we got, I think we did, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=702.3199999999999s)]
*  we're very rational and got very fair. I think it was a fair deal for all parties. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=707.3599999999999s)]
*  Fair wins the day. Always. I would always suggest that. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=712.56s)]
*  I mean, unfair is one of the things that got us in this mess a few years ago. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=715.92s)]
*  Unfair leads to, it always goes wrong. Not always, but it usually goes wrong. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=720.48s)]
*  And so we felt good about, we feel very good about our shareholder base. We felt very good about [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=725.44s)]
*  Rays. Another unique aspect of radio pharmaceuticals is we inject incredibly small amounts of drug. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=730.5600000000001s)]
*  So these are injections of a hundred or so micrograms of drug. And radioactivity is [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=742.48s)]
*  only on about one in a thousand. So it's an incredible thing. So there isn't an anxiety of [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=751.28s)]
*  the toxicity is the radio isotope. There isn't, you're at such a low mass of drug that you're not [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=761.84s)]
*  going to have drug effects. And so this is a long-winded way to say common in the space. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=769.28s)]
*  And certainly in the origins of glutathera pubicto is compassionate use case work. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=779.12s)]
*  In Germany, Austria, it's also done in some other countries where patients that have failed [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=785.12s)]
*  standard of care can be prescribed by a local, by locally produced and locally manufactured [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=789.68s)]
*  radioactive drug product. Even if it's not approved yet. It has some safety understanding to it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=797.92s)]
*  Sure. So we have with our research collaborators in Germany and Austria have been able to do [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=804.88s)]
*  and investigate our drugs already in patients. And so that I think really [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=810.0s)]
*  is an accelerating decision. Go, no, go. It's a very unique aspect of this drug image. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=814.88s)]
*  Where the drug is and then you can treat the patient. So yeah, it's a very quantitative [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=822.08s)]
*  sport, so to speak. Yeah. And so that I think even though the company's only [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=827.84s)]
*  not quite three years old, we came with a big IP position to start. And John Babish was at Cornell, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=833.28s)]
*  his IP portfolio is fully in the company, other than what we had sold to buyer. And so [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=842.64s)]
*  in that sense, it's a different sport. It's not like we said, we have a new platform or [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=850.16s)]
*  we have an idea. We're going to raise a large series A and just try to get going on it. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=856.4s)]
*  When we really showed up with, we have a fair bit of, we filed two INDs already. We put up a fair [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=861.1999999999999s)]
*  body of knowledge around that. Yeah. That low, I guess low ratio of radioactivity. Yeah. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=867.6s)]
*  Am I getting that right? Does that play favorably to like one of the biggest problems in biologics [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=877.84s)]
*  right now from a patient access perspective is cost of development, cost of manufacturing? [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=885.2s)]
*  Is there an advantage there? I would say, unfortunately, no. I do think that society has... [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=893.5200000000001s)]
*  Well, yes and no. It depends. In the spectrum of things, I'd say the upside is we have synthetic, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=901.2800000000001s)]
*  organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry that can just make the precursor. But there is [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=908.72s)]
*  significant expense in the manufacturing of the way you're putting radioactivity on the drug. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=913.44s)]
*  So just that process is expensive in the scheme of things compared to many [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=917.9200000000001s)]
*  gene therapies, for example, it's still a lot cheaper than a lot of... Yeah. I mean, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=924.24s)]
*  I think society's got pretty good at scaling up on it. So it's not prohibitive cost-wise, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=929.44s)]
*  but I can't say it's a cheap sport. And as you know, any manufacturer right now, small [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=938.64s)]
*  oil, but the cogs for the cold drug are cheaper here. No question. Yes. The radioactive part that's [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=948.0s)]
*  expensive. Right. Okay. I'm sorry. No, no. Yeah. You were saying you're based in Boston and also [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=954.96s)]
*  last year in addition to that series A open an R&D facility. We did. So that was interesting to me. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=964.48s)]
*  I'd like to hear about what goes on there at that R&D facility. Yeah. So it's funny [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=969.84s)]
*  having witnessed both insourcing and outsourcing. With radioactivity, it's a lot easier to [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=975.84s)]
*  source. You're just making decisions. In general, it is. Because no one in the outsourcing community [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=981.68s)]
*  wants to deal with radioactivity. That was my background. The old topic of eCro is like the [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=988.56s)]
*  primary outsource service providers. And they're a great company. But it's also speed. You still [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=994.08s)]
*  want to use them for certain things. But just quick speed is a big issue. And there's a lot of [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=999.9200000000001s)]
*  assays with radioactivity. Just having a lab that can handle radioactivity is inherently [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1006.32s)]
*  different than having all certain classic ad-vd and pk that might be easier to outsource. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1012.64s)]
*  It's always a time and money conversation. So we built a 19,000 square foot headquarter lab in the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1022.0s)]
*  Seaport of Boston. It's about 45% lab, 50% office. So true discovery facility, medicinal chemistry, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1028.4s)]
*  radio chemistry in vitro, ex vivo, and pharmacology. Yeah. What does that mean? Give us [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1038.96s)]
*  to the best of your ability an illustration of what that looks like and how those different [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1050.5600000000002s)]
*  disciplines are situated physically and encouraged to work together. Yeah. When giving me a lab tour, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1056.16s)]
*  which I'll happily give you, you can start. You can think. There's four medicinal chemists making [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1063.28s)]
*  compounds. We do use CMOs as well. So sometimes they'll be building [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1074.3999999999999s)]
*  part of the molecule doing some of the syntheses. And that's a classic med camp lab. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1081.36s)]
*  And then in order of operations, next would be the radio chemistry lab. They're unique in that you [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1087.76s)]
*  have probably 30 metric tons of lead in that lab. And we're in a really cool building in the Seaport [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1094.24s)]
*  called the Design Center, which was the largest building in the US when the Pentagon was built [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1103.92s)]
*  in the 30s. So it was really for storage of arms. So it's kind of 18. It can handle that kind of [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1109.28s)]
*  weight on the sixth floor. Usually radio chemistry are in the basement. Yeah. But that building [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1117.2s)]
*  specifically can handle that. And then we have a vivarium just for mice and rats. And there's a [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1122.56s)]
*  lot of procedure rooms in there as well. The most common assay would be to do a bio distribution [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1128.08s)]
*  study and gamma count or just count radioactivity per organ to understand the bio D of the drug. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1133.04s)]
*  And we have a biochemistry lab, a cell culture lab, a biochem lab where we can do in vitro and [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1140.8s)]
*  ex vivo work. You have to take special precautions in terms of like the... I mean, if I walk around [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1148.72s)]
*  your lab with a Geiger meter, would I get real concerned? Yeah. So there's Geiger counters. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1157.76s)]
*  We would give you a dosimeter, a visiting dosimeter just to come into the lab. And then there's Geiger [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1162.64s)]
*  counters on the way in and out to make sure you're not radioactive. These are very serious things, but [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1168.64s)]
*  openly not like... If you were at Los Alamos, there would be more stressful radioisotopes. These are all [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1178.96s)]
*  isotopes used in medicines. Right. They have rational half-lives of decay. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1190.64s)]
*  But yes, there's a lot of repercussions. Everyone has to be trained. You have a... [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1196.88s)]
*  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has to have a bond. There's a lot of licensing and safety that [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1200.96s)]
*  goes into that. But it's... And depending on the day, absolutely, a Geiger counter would light up. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1206.0s)]
*  Now, hopefully at the end of the day, it would not. So happily, when everyone's going home from the [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1212.56s)]
*  lab, there wouldn't just be radioactivity out on the table. That's part of the rules. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1218.64s)]
*  You can do white tests and it's just the nature of that. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1225.92s)]
*  Yeah. I was just curious. We cover a lot of companies that have biologic. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1229.92s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. High-pquency biologics is different now. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1234.88s)]
*  Yeah. This would be nothing as stressful as a BSL-3, a BSL-4. But there's a... You have to [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1239.2800000000002s)]
*  be careful. The biggest among them is the safety. Safety for always, safety for everyone working [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1248.5600000000002s)]
*  there. And also just safety. I think you just have to be really diligent to not get... There's [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1253.7600000000002s)]
*  special ventilation. Radioactivity iodine, for example, can be volatile. So you have stacks with [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1262.16s)]
*  monitors and so on. But you just can't let radioactivity out of the facility. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1269.44s)]
*  Yeah. What might the future hold in terms of building that space out as you get closer to [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1274.64s)]
*  manufacturing, as you build the need for manufacturing capacity? Is that in the work, [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1281.52s)]
*  in the plans or...? Yeah. We decided to go on a partner strategy for manufacturing. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1287.76s)]
*  We have a really good partner, which will also be press releasing that alliance this quarter [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1295.28s)]
*  in North America and another partner in Europe. Many companies in our space have decided to [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1302.3200000000002s)]
*  vertically integrate their manufacturing. We just saw how strong these CDMOs are [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1308.3200000000002s)]
*  in this space and felt we should partner in the make-buy partner conversation. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1316.88s)]
*  I think our core competency is really in discovery and translation. And I think our capital is better [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1322.8s)]
*  spent on that. And we'll file an I&D this year for our first therapeutic. The first two I&Ds [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1328.0s)]
*  were for imaging. So this would be the first therapeutic I&D. Yeah. So this is an interesting... [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1337.1200000000001s)]
*  As you started to go down that path explaining why it's rational. But now I understand it's more [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1345.28s)]
*  necessary than even rational. Yeah. It's pretty hard. It's not impossible. If, let's say, you were [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1354.8s)]
*  working on a target for which there was already an established diagnostic, like PSMA or somatostatin, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1361.12s)]
*  even FAP, which is our lead program, we did an appeal for our FAP diagnostic with LAMPTIAS. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1369.1200000000001s)]
*  And now we finished the phase one and they'll clinically develop it. But there's a couple other [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1375.1200000000001s)]
*  groups making FAP diagnostics. But if you're going after a target that for which there isn't one, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1379.3600000000001s)]
*  you're going to have to... People are going to want to see the inclusion criteria that this person [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1385.04s)]
*  is... You're going to want to know that you have high enough concentration target to put that [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1391.1200000000001s)]
*  patient on a radiotherapy. Yeah. Are there advantages beyond... I mean, the obvious advantage [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1397.68s)]
*  is if you identify a new target, you can create the diagnostic you're well equipped to move quickly [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1405.68s)]
*  and be agile. Are there other advantages? I think that it is the... One of the big advantages can be [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1412.48s)]
*  with while you're working on the diagnostic, you're going to really understand if you have a [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1422.4s)]
*  therapy. So just that. And some people would even differentiate them. I want to understand [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1427.44s)]
*  what are the pharmacogenetics of my portfolio for this target. And you need to understand [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1434.0s)]
*  if you have a drug. The correlation to antibody drug conjugates in having an LPTE or something [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1443.76s)]
*  like this. You really... The concentration seen in the PET scan is very predictive of the outcome [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1451.28s)]
*  of the therapy. So if you have a really high concentration in the PET scan, your likelihood [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1461.76s)]
*  of response is higher. It's specific to the drug and the target. Right. Okay. And when you do a [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1468.8s)]
*  PET scan, you inject them and scan someone. And here for the therapy, it's really about the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1476.56s)]
*  residence time over... You want a half-life of residents of 100 hours. That's the residence [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1482.0s)]
*  time you need. So they don't need to be the same molecule. Our diagnostic, for example, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1490.1599999999999s)]
*  is the one that's not there. They have our therapy stays on the target. Yeah. So you mentioned that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1494.8799999999999s)]
*  there are compassionate use cases where locally sourced radiotherapeutics are being used, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1502.0s)]
*  as I said, in compassionate use examples. But yet you say it's not insignificant to manufacture [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1508.32s)]
*  this therapeutics in terms of cost. So it's interesting to me. I'm struggling to... Those sites [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1518.24s)]
*  have a radiopharmacy. They have radiochemists. They already have the infrastructure. Gotcha. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1525.36s)]
*  And that's really a one-off. It's really when you think about scaling something across a continent [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1531.8400000000001s)]
*  for supply of all patients. I think Novaris has done a great job of scaling up their manufacturing. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1537.6000000000001s)]
*  They're in a growing phase because the demand is outpacing the supply, but they're addressing them. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1545.28s)]
*  And so there, it just gets harder as you scale. No, that's good. I'm glad I asked. I'm glad you [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1552.56s)]
*  cleared that up for me because when I hear that use locality, I think, oh, that may lead itself to [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1557.68s)]
*  scalability and distribution of therapeutics globally. And in this case, that's not the case. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1563.2s)]
*  And they're a little different. Those are really... They'll have release criteria and QC, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1568.3200000000002s)]
*  but they just scale. And so I think part of the excitement that the big players come to market is [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1577.44s)]
*  now real dollars and of really good companies are putting real effort into making sure that [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1586.64s)]
*  this is a scalable enterprise and it's already being done. So there's many ways isotopes are [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1595.36s)]
*  produced and both through public channels like the DOE, but also through [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1604.48s)]
*  commercial enterprises. But historically where there's a will, there's a way. If there's an end, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1612.8s)]
*  society will make an instance. Yeah. You mentioned earlier, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1622.48s)]
*  their undergrad is in mathematics. I have a PhD. I'm sorry. Yes. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1626.24s)]
*  And you gave me a little bit of backstory on what brought you to ratio. But the sciences space [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1637.2s)]
*  in general, what was the motivation to say, was it just kind of for doing this? Were you following [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1647.0400000000002s)]
*  the... Yeah. I would say that I came from an imaging lab and so I was working on [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1652.96s)]
*  imaging problems and did a postdoc at a German national lab where we developed this. The lab [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1662.32s)]
*  developed a technology, a nuclear imaging technology for [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1669.68s)]
*  rodent imaging. Yeah. It was the same resolution. Was that experience like... I guess the question [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1674.8s)]
*  I'm wanting to get to is like, was that experience a revealing of a passion or were you sort of the [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1681.92s)]
*  mathematician who would apply his mathematical skills to any problem presented to him? Yeah. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1690.64s)]
*  Because you stayed, right? You stuck around. Now you're leading a biopharmaceutical company. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The term events was... After that, an American company enlisted. I moved to [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1701.92s)]
*  Hungary where we made the product. And I took right-hand turn and really worked on that product [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1708.08s)]
*  and saw and really traveled, lived on an airplane effectively as we sold the product and got [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1714.48s)]
*  intimate with a lot of universities and pharmaceutical companies using this technology [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1721.4399999999998s)]
*  in their research. And with a passion of doing quantitative analyses, writing software [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1727.28s)]
*  and then build a company based on that as a software service. And [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1734.16s)]
*  saw I really gained respect for pharma companies and how solid they were at adopting technology [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1741.04s)]
*  and being very thorough. I just gained a lot of respect for pharma. Really? And I was really [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1749.8400000000001s)]
*  impressed with how... When you say biosexiety, I'm listening to you. I don't know like pharmaceutical [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1755.44s)]
*  industry is... I mean, big bi was like notorious for being laggard in terms of tech adoption. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1761.28s)]
*  You're talking biotech. You're talking like this is a new age of biotech. I would say... No. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1767.12s)]
*  All pharma. Yeah. Big biotech and pharma. So both big and small. The small typically couldn't afford [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1775.52s)]
*  this infrastructure. So they were outsourcing, which is why we started a company. But I was very [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1782.56s)]
*  impressed with how many of them would... I don't want to be critical of universities, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1788.96s)]
*  but universities would have... Some universities would have been great, but others wouldn't build [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1796.48s)]
*  out a facility and not necessarily be putting it through its paces. Where when pharma decided to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1799.76s)]
*  go after and deploy a technology for use in their discovery programs, they were impressive. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1805.04s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Good stuff. So what if we had a protected pharma or huge... [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1813.84s)]
*  If I could shift your paradigm. Yeah. They are... Well, maybe. You can try. In my experience, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1823.84s)]
*  they're absolutely willing to make significant investments in new technology if it serves their [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1830.9599999999998s)]
*  purpose to make a go-no-go decision in their discovery business. Yeah. Yeah. And it's a... [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1838.0s)]
*  I make a sweeping generalization. Yeah. You look at the past 10 years where this wave has been [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1843.68s)]
*  building around AI and machine learning. And it's the age-old conversation about innovation, [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1851.76s)]
*  that kind of innovation, even scientific innovation coming from biotech and [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1858.48s)]
*  feeding up into big biome. Yeah. I think having [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1862.96s)]
*  a big... Build and run an informatics company in previous life. But obviously, that ratio, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1868.24s)]
*  we are very dedicated to a data management platform where all data are coming in, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1873.2s)]
*  they're being adjusted. We put good effort into ingestion and evaluation. Throwing AI is another [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1877.76s)]
*  tool. And obviously, with ChatGPT, we have now a language model tool, right? But you have to have, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1885.36s)]
*  well, structured data to glean insights. We certainly have made it easier as a society to [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1894.08s)]
*  use those tools. But the effort is, if you look at data science, it's 90% [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1906.08s)]
*  management and 10% analysis. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, even the super heavy AI-centric companies I've [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1911.52s)]
*  talked to, you compare and contrast what they're doing to the company that's just playing the AI, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1920.16s)]
*  nobody played your game because it's sexy right now. Yeah. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1928.3200000000002s)]
*  Those fundamentals are key among the understanders, right? Yeah. This space does lend it imaging [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1932.8000000000002s)]
*  radiology in general. It lends itself very well to machine learning. So, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1939.1200000000001s)]
*  radiology has had the most AI, FDA approvals in terms of readouts. Nuclear medicine left less. So, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1947.2800000000002s)]
*  we did, in our lifetime, it was turned a lot of machine learning on this type of data. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1956.4s)]
*  Yeah. And we're seeing, obviously, movement in digital technology as well, but it's a harder [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1962.8000000000002s)]
*  problem. Yeah. But it's... Right. Yeah. So, I could talk about that all day. Oh, another episode. Yeah. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1966.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. What's the next for ratio? What's the next big step on the continuum? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1973.6000000000001s)]
*  Finally, we designed the continuum. Now, we've seen success with this platform making fit for [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1980.48s)]
*  purpose molecules, having this tunable nature of being able to immediately look at what is the [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1987.8400000000001s)]
*  right funnel. It's been impressive how quantitatively tunable the platform is [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=1995.44s)]
*  by modifying the album binder. And so, turning our focus on to a couple of the targets where [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2003.04s)]
*  we think we can make an improvement on existing melodies. I don't know that... We, to date, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2010.16s)]
*  have not gone after completely novel targets. We've worked on targets that are well characterized. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2017.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a lot faster. There's preclinical information. When things are well characterized, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2024.24s)]
*  we can turn our attention. So, that's been a strategic decision to make. Yeah. And I don't see [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2030.96s)]
*  that changing. So, yeah, it should be... We're pretty excited. We're very optimistic around [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2037.2s)]
*  the needs of the program because we've already treated patients. Yeah. That's an advantage. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2045.52s)]
*  And when you come to a place like San Francisco, a big investor conference, what are you [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2052.2400000000002s)]
*  looking to get out? What's the story of the end all? I have... Right after this, I will go to [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2059.28s)]
*  a meeting with potential collaborators in the pharma space. We know our role in the industry [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2065.52s)]
*  and it's very often to be good to have... So, I'm looking at potential licensing discussions, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2074.08s)]
*  meetings with more B2B. We just closed our series B. So, I am meeting with some financiers, but [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2079.12s)]
*  we're ongoing relations. Business development. Yeah. I'm not like... You don't have your pitch [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2088.72s)]
*  deck in your pocket. I don't. I did enough pitching last year. No, not this year. That would be the [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2096.48s)]
*  focus. Yeah. Relationships. Just good conversations about what's happening in the market. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2105.6s)]
*  And then we already have some strategic partnerships with the pharma, so we need to build speed. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2112.08s)]
*  Yeah. Good deal. Well, hopefully this conversation serves as a warm up for your next one. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2117.2s)]
*  Yeah. What haven't I asked you that I should have asked you about you and Ray's show? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2123.44s)]
*  Yeah. What part of the story am I missing? It's your last chance. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2128.16s)]
*  It's your last chance to do something other than give me your pitch deck. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2134.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I think that you asked having... I have helped start and build a couple of organizations [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2140.3199999999997s)]
*  and you asked what would you say to an entrepreneur? Yeah. I mean, that's... Yeah. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  I just think... I mean, I think that... I will say... Some people say, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2156.0s)]
*  what would you do differently? And very often, it's just, I wouldn't have done it. But not quite [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2162.16s)]
*  that. I would just say making sure you're getting people advising you who have done it and are [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2166.96s)]
*  wildly critical of what you're doing. There is just no value in people telling you that you're... [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2175.92s)]
*  Well, since you brought it up, I'll ask you a follow-up question. What do you find in that [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2181.68s)]
*  group of people or even if it's small... What sort of form do you find yourself in where you're [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2187.92s)]
*  exposing yourself to that sort of criticism by the folks who have scraped their knees? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2192.96s)]
*  I think that could be a benefit of raising capital or just the history of doing business. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2200.16s)]
*  It's not a single answer. I would say the people whose advice I see have pretty varied backgrounds [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2208.2400000000002s)]
*  and varied experiences, but they all have good experience. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2216.16s)]
*  Are you saying not necessarily just in vital tech? [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2219.04s)]
*  In life, but I think that... I think of a few people that are either on the board or, frankly, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2221.6s)]
*  observing or coming or have invested in whose opinion I respect and trying to triangulate [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2227.36s)]
*  from them what their thoughts are. And always... I'm a big believer in always finding someone who's... [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2234.56s)]
*  I assume it's not that one of the most dumb or the most... So just finding someone who... [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2241.76s)]
*  That PhD in mathematics. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2248.96s)]
*  So finding someone who can give, who's been there, can give you... You don't have to do everything [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2250.7200000000003s)]
*  you say, but you really need... My biggest mistake I think comes from people who convince themselves [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2255.76s)]
*  or something. And that may or may not be true. And they need feedback. They need pushback. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2261.6000000000004s)]
*  One last question on that. What's a safe forum for that kind of... Is it a one-to-one? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2268.16s)]
*  I prefer one-to-one. And usually before a board meeting. I don't think... I think a board meeting [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2273.7599999999998s)]
*  should really be alignment, execution. I think we'd all like to think about strategy in a board [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2280.96s)]
*  meeting. It's good to discuss them, but I don't think there should be surprises in board meetings. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2289.44s)]
*  I don't think there should be surprises in board meetings. I think those conversations should [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2295.2799999999997s)]
*  take place prior to... You should... Consensus building is the job of the CEO. The consensus [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2298.7999999999997s)]
*  can't be built just in a board meeting. It has to be built prior. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2304.56s)]
*  Yeah. Do you consider yourself a serial entrepreneur at this point or do you need [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2307.7599999999998s)]
*  a couple more notches? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2312.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't... I've only done things because I thought that you had a good mission, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drvf4C-mY4M&t=2313.2s)]
