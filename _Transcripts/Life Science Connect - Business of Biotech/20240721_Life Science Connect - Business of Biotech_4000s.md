Video Description: While organic chemistry lectures caused many of his peers at NYU to wring their hands, gnash their teeth, and question life choices, then-19-year-old Enrique Diloné ate those classes for lunch. They inspired him to earn a Seton Hall Ph.D. in chemistry and to go to work as a big bio research scientist. Along the way, Dr. Diloné got bit by the biotech business bug. It wasn’t easy. A whole bunch of MBA and executive learning programs at Rutgers, MIT, and Harvard, and many years of experience later, he’s Chief Technology Officer at ImmunityBio, which he joined in advance of the company winning FDA approval of ANKTIVA, its IL-15 Receptor Agonist for BCG-Unresponsive Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, in April '24. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we follow Dr. Diloné’s path from the bench to the boardroom, and learn how valuable that rare bridge between CMC and the executive offices really is.

*  Not too long ago on episode 197 of this very podcast, I had a conversation with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=63.6s)]
*  immunity bio chief medical officer, Dr. Bobby Reddy, about the company's then impending first [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  approval. An immunotherapy called ANCTIVA that has since gained FDA approval in non-muscle invasive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=78.0s)]
*  bladder cancer and one that offers many improvements over the current standard of care. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=84.88s)]
*  Beyond Dr. Reddy's role in ANCTIVA's successful rollout, it was a meaningful conversation for [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=90.88s)]
*  me personally given the role I've been playing in my dad's care for that very indication. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business of Biotech and on today's show, we're digging even deeper [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=103.28s)]
*  into that success and the people behind it with Dr. Enrique De Lone, who's served as [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=108.24s)]
*  chief technology officer at ImmunityBio since 2023. On this episode, we'll follow and learn [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=114.88s)]
*  from Dr. De Lone's transition from the research lab to the business side of biotech, how he did it, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=122.08s)]
*  how his experiences put him in position to join immunity at a pivotal moment, the roles he's been [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=128.8s)]
*  playing in the company's next post-commercial chapter with ANCTIVA, and the broad spectrum of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=135.44s)]
*  follow-up programs the company is pursuing in lung, colorectal and ovarian cancers, acute myeloid [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=142.32000000000002s)]
*  leukemia, glioblastoma, solid tumors, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and HIV. Enrique, thank you for joining [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=150.56s)]
*  us. My pleasure, Matt. That is an aggressive list of programs that I just rattled off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=159.28s)]
*  You have got your hands full. Yes, we do. It's all in a day's work. It's all in a day's work. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=166.32s)]
*  All in a day's work. Yeah, yeah. We're going to get into that. I've got questions for you on that [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=174.32s)]
*  very aggressive pipeline that you guys are forming up, but I want to start by rewinding the clock a [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=180.32s)]
*  little bit. You and I had the benefit of a conversation not too long ago, and it made me [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=187.35999999999999s)]
*  recall the story. My son just returned from his first year, his freshman year at Penn State [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=194.64s)]
*  University, and when he got home, we were having a conversation about his academic experiences, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  and he said, you know what? He said, organic chemistry is the leading cause of depression [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=207.36s)]
*  in State College, Pennsylvania, which is where Penn State University is. He got through it, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=212.08s)]
*  he got through it, but he said it was a class like no other in terms of its impact, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=218.08s)]
*  more often than not negative on his peers. You, on the other hand, told me that you ran circles [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=225.04000000000002s)]
*  around your peers in organic chemistry and that the experience there was one of many that influenced [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=232.64s)]
*  the rest of your academic and industry experiences. So tell us a little bit about that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=239.44s)]
*  Tell us about that academic influence on your path to biopharma. Well, Matt, let me thank you for [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=245.83999999999997s)]
*  having me. I really appreciate the opportunity. I was, I think I must have been 19 years old when [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  I took that class, and at the time that I took the class, I was still thinking I was going to be [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=262.48s)]
*  a pre-med student and ultimately a physician, not thinking that chemistry would interest me all that [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=270.48s)]
*  much. But when I started organic chemistry, I very quickly switched to a chemistry major, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=278.8s)]
*  which was not the case with most of the pre-med students. And I just enjoyed being in the lab. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=287.28s)]
*  It was a little, it took me back a little bit. It's sort of finding your calling in a way, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=295.28s)]
*  which is a little bit nerdy, but I just enjoyed the laboratory. I couldn't get enough of it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=300.55999999999995s)]
*  I, the textbook piece and understanding and reading, the pre-med guys had a pretty solid [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=310.24s)]
*  grasp of that, just regurgitating a lot of the information. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=317.6s)]
*  But actually going in the laboratory and conducting, doing chemistry, that's what I enjoyed. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=322.16s)]
*  And many times my experiments, I don't remember any one of my experiments failing [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  when I was in the laboratory. So, and some of them were pretty intense, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=335.6s)]
*  oxidations and the Grignard reaction. If you get a little bit of water in there, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=342.24s)]
*  the Grignard reaction doesn't work. So it was interesting. And so I went back to my father [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=346.96s)]
*  and I told him, I want to be a chemist. And of course there was the ensued discussion. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=354.71999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, you just for the audience's benefit, your father was a physician, wasn't he? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=361.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. My father was a physician. He was a pediatrician. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=365.68s)]
*  And he wanted that app. He wanted that apple to fall close to the tree. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=369.12s)]
*  That's exactly right. That's exactly right. But then once we had that discussion, he talked to [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=373.12s)]
*  some of his peers and he recognized, well, you know, so chemistry is a good profession. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=378.4s)]
*  And as it turns out, he influenced me still further because then he told me, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  why don't you at least work making medicines? And that's how I actually wound up in pharma. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=390.4s)]
*  He convinced me of that. And so that was how that happened. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=397.44s)]
*  Was that convincing, that inspiration to move into Florida and the influence of your dad before or [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=402.64s)]
*  after you earned your PhD? I know you got your PhD in chemistry from Seton Hall, but [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=409.44s)]
*  did you pursue that PhD with the intention to move into medicine making? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=414.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I knew. So at this point, when I was having that conversation with my father, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=418.55999999999995s)]
*  I was still working on my bachelor's at NYU. And the once I graduated from NYU, I knew I wanted to [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=425.84s)]
*  pursue additional degrees. And somebody recommended Seton Hall University. And I needed [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=433.84s)]
*  at the time, I needed a small university, my environment. I just from having been in the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=440.08s)]
*  city for as long as I was. And so once I went to Seton Hall University, I did my masters, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=444.88s)]
*  but then I had to work for a little bit. Somebody had suggested to me that I pursue my PhD. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  And again, once I went to Roche, Hoffman-La Roche, I studied in the generics industry when I went, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=458.24s)]
*  when I graduated with my master's, but very quickly moved to Hoffman-La Roche at the time. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=463.76s)]
*  Their number one product was Ciftriazone or rocephan. It was a cephalosporin. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=470.4s)]
*  And I'd been working on cephalosporins for about a year. So I got into the company and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  the company ultimately helped me with my PhD. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's outstanding. And then [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=482.4s)]
*  those early years, I mean, you mentioned that you like the lab. You like the lab. You [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=489.12s)]
*  you're a yourself, you, you, you self-identified as a little bit nerdy, which I guess I did. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=494.32s)]
*  Yeah. So, so why not stay there? I mean, you, you moved into a business capacity in bio [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  after, after spending those, those years at Hoffman-La Roche and Wyeth [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=512.96s)]
*  in the science and research capacities. What inspired you to take a look at the, the business [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=517.6s)]
*  side? So I wanted, I wanted a greater say on how products got developed. I, I, I felt [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=521.6s)]
*  when I was at Roche, I remember I got to a point where I felt I can contribute more. I know I can. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=535.52s)]
*  I really, that was a very strong urge that I really felt after I had been at Roche for nine [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=542.08s)]
*  and a half years, and I really felt like I could contribute more after I got my PhD, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=549.0400000000001s)]
*  I left Roche and went to Wyeth and they put me on a global team. And I mean, I, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=554.64s)]
*  immediately I was able to contribute to global drug development. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=560.88s)]
*  So it was just a question of just understanding. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=568.08s)]
*  For lack of a better word, Matt, you just knew you could contribute further to the business, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=573.2800000000001s)]
*  to just the aspects of developing the, whatever the asset was. As you, as you got exposure, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=578.32s)]
*  because at Roche I was in quality control. I was in pharmaceutical development and I was in drug [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=584.24s)]
*  metabolism, servicing the discovery groups. So I understood pretty broadly the whole [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=590.88s)]
*  preclinical aspects of drug development until commercialization in QC, the technical aspects [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=598.64s)]
*  of it, not the biology, the technical aspects of drug development. And so as I moved up the ranks, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=605.76s)]
*  it just became clear to me, I wanted more. And when I went to Wyeth, they put me on a global, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=615.68s)]
*  they then taught me global drug development. They exposed me to colleagues around the globe. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=621.68s)]
*  I began to understand all the geographies and how to get drugs approved, basically, how to work [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=628.48s)]
*  collectively as in a multidisciplinary team to get drugs approved. And not just from [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=635.76s)]
*  the technical aspects of it, but also everything to do with that. How do you relate to your team [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=642.72s)]
*  members? How do you work with the process? There was a maturity emerging and then very quickly, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=648.0s)]
*  somebody plucked me out of big pharma. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=657.76s)]
*  Lucked you out of big pharma. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=660.24s)]
*  I want to hover just for another minute or two on the period where you began to feel as though [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  you had more to contribute. And here's why. I've made mention of this on the podcast recently on [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=672.72s)]
*  a few occasions. I don't know if you're a Redditor, if you ever go on Reddit, but there's a subreddit [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=680.0s)]
*  called biotech. It's a biotech subreddit. And I'd say the bulk, if not a good portion of the [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=688.16s)]
*  conversation on that, the user generated conversation is around aspirational, it's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=694.5600000000001s)]
*  lab employees and research scientists who have aspirations to move into the business side. And [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=701.44s)]
*  they're asking questions about it. How do I do it? What path do I take? What do I need to learn? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=707.76s)]
*  Who do I need to talk to? And I wonder retrospectively now that you've got the [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=711.76s)]
*  benefit of wisdom behind you. When you first began to feel as though you had more to offer, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=717.36s)]
*  had you been given the opportunity to offer more at that point, do you think you would have been [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=724.88s)]
*  ready? Or do you think there were key experiences between that sort of emotion and I guess, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=728.64s)]
*  aspiration and the actual exposure you had or opportunity you had that were key to being [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=736.72s)]
*  successful in a role that required, I guess, more directorial skill and more vision? [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=742.8s)]
*  That's an interesting question. I think that there's no question that you have, I mean, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=754.32s)]
*  a key learner inevitably is failure. It's just a key teacher that you go through [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=763.52s)]
*  different kinds of failures, be that a product failure or a bankruptcy in a small biotech or [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=773.68s)]
*  whatever it is that you just can't read about something like that. You have to be exposed to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=779.52s)]
*  that sort of thing. But even in the large companies, many times we had worked on products [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=786.32s)]
*  for many years, many years, and then it got to a point where for whatever reason, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=794.32s)]
*  some of them were clinical or talks or there was a technical challenge, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=802.6400000000001s)]
*  you were told you're not working on this product anymore. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=807.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. And you asked me, was I ready? It's difficult for me to say, to be honest, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=810.64s)]
*  Matt. It's difficult for me to say definitively that I was ready for this or that. I think there [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=819.92s)]
*  is an aggressiveness when you're young that sort of needs to be tempered so that eagerness and [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=826.8s)]
*  aggressiveness is directed positively when you're working, especially when you're working with other [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=834.8s)]
*  people and everybody that I think a lot of people that have talent at some point think [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=840.0s)]
*  they're the smartest person in the room. And then you come to terms and you realize that [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=847.52s)]
*  even for all your academic credentials and everything else, the center of the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=854.64s)]
*  knowledge of the universe doesn't revolve around you. But I think at the time I would have been [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=859.12s)]
*  ready if something had been offered to me that was appropriate. And it was just the case that [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=867.84s)]
*  that just didn't happen. I think many times, Matt, when you come into an organization at a certain [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=878.1600000000001s)]
*  level, it's difficult for people to view you differently even as you grow. It's like your [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=885.0400000000001s)]
*  parents, right? Your parents always see you as their kid. You could be president, but you're still [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=894.08s)]
*  my kid. And so it's the same thing when you go in at a certain level in an organization and you move [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=899.5200000000001s)]
*  up the ranks. There are people that are never going to be able to make that transition as you make the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=907.76s)]
*  transition in maturity and role. And so it takes effort for people to make those transitions. And [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=915.36s)]
*  so usually, I remember speaking at the time with several of my colleagues, they told me, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=922.88s)]
*  if you want to move up the ranks, now that you've gotten your PhD, you have to go to another [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=928.24s)]
*  organization that views you as a PhD level scientist and doesn't view you as the entry [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=933.92s)]
*  level person that you came in as. And it's nothing, there's, you know, it's just, so that was the first [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=940.88s)]
*  really hit to my ego that in industry that forced me to grow up, you know, it's just a matter of [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=948.64s)]
*  reality. Yeah. Did that experience coincide or is that corollary with, I wanted to get back to the [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=958.0799999999999s)]
*  comment you made about being plucked out of big bio. No, so that was two years later. That was, [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=964.8s)]
*  when I went to WISE, I went in as an, not an entry level, but a couple of levels above entry level [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  as a PhD scientist. They treated me really well. And then I was there for about a year and a half [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=977.52s)]
*  doing well, almost, you know, about to get promoted. And then that's when a colleague from [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=985.84s)]
*  Roche called me, probably the most, one of the most influential people in my career, Steven [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=993.28s)]
*  Sapinski. And he called me and he was the one that plucked me out of large pharma and gave me a [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1000.4000000000001s)]
*  tremendous opportunity. To this day, I'm thankful to Steve for that. Yeah. And what move was that? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1008.1600000000001s)]
*  That was when I went to ITAT. I went to a small New York firm focused on acute macular degeneration. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1014.6400000000001s)]
*  It was ophthalmology and they were developing this very interesting drug. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1025.3600000000001s)]
*  It was an oligonucleotide, a pegulated oligonucleotide that was to be dosed directly [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1031.2s)]
*  into the eye for macular degeneration. We ultimately got that drug approved. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1037.84s)]
*  That was a great experience, I think. I worked there for about three years under the ITAT brand [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  and then OSI bought them. And I worked for an additional, I want to say total five years [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1050.56s)]
*  together between the two entities. So that was a great experience and gave me a lot of exposure. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1056.72s)]
*  What was the role that you took there? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1063.36s)]
*  So originally I was director of analytical development and quality control. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1065.6799999999998s)]
*  So the bulk of my career up until 2010 was primarily focused on analytical chemistry, [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1070.56s)]
*  in some capacity. Just developing the assays and the methods, working side by side with the [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1079.92s)]
*  process scientists folks to get the drug ready for the marketing application. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1089.04s)]
*  Yeah. Was it at ITAC? So help me out with the chronology here. You shared with me an anecdote [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1095.8400000000001s)]
*  the last time we spoke about achieving clarity around your lack of business acumen in a specific [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1102.48s)]
*  setting that inspired you to further educate in terms of the business side. Was that at ITAC? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1114.8s)]
*  No, no. That was at Amicus Therapeutics. I was at Amicus Therapeutics. This is around [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1121.6s)]
*  2012. I've come into Amicus. Now I have technical operations. At the time it was very small, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1130.4s)]
*  but it was growing. It was a growing area in the company. And I got promoted to vice president, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1137.8400000000001s)]
*  which was, I was elated. I finally made it to the executive ranks. I was a head of a function. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  And then I remember being in some of the meetings with the rest of the senior [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1153.28s)]
*  Amicus leadership. And there's just talking all these terms that I'm unfamiliar with. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1157.6799999999998s)]
*  And a lot of it is just business jargon. How to raise money, talking about [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1164.24s)]
*  NPIs and NPVs, discount cash flows, all these, how do you value that deal? How do you value this deal? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1172.48s)]
*  How do we envision the bottom line on this? I hadn't worried about cogs until then. All this [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1180.24s)]
*  is I'm worried about developing drugs. And so that's when I finally did. I finally, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1189.6s)]
*  it came to mind that I have to go to business school. I have to do some formal business training. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  And I remember the seminal moment came when I was at a PDA FDA meeting in an elevator [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1204.24s)]
*  with this very competent person. She was on the board of directors of PDA, Ursula Busy. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1212.16s)]
*  And I knew she had a PhD in an MBA. And I asked her, what made you go for the MBA? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1219.2s)]
*  And she said, they were talking over me. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1227.2s)]
*  And I completely related to that experience. And that's when I decided I had to go for a [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1230.3999999999999s)]
*  business degree, which I ultimately did. And that was a fish out of water. You really realize that [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1236.8799999999999s)]
*  when you go, I'm sure there's a lot of people that can relate to this, but [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1249.04s)]
*  you're going to school thinking, again, now, after 20 plus years in the business, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1253.44s)]
*  you go into school and just all these different [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1261.04s)]
*  opinions and different points of view and different perspectives, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1267.3600000000001s)]
*  having been in science for as long as I had been by that point, [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1272.4s)]
*  I'm going to go into business school. And I'm going to go into business school. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1275.76s)]
*  Having been in science for as long as I had been by that point, again, it was another [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1280.56s)]
*  force moment to mature and realize, you know, you're sort of by this point, you're not as [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1287.44s)]
*  shocked because you should have realized, okay, you know, this progression consistently humbles you. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1295.2s)]
*  That's just my opinion. But consistently, as you move up the ranks and you realize the [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1305.3600000000001s)]
*  complexity of the problems that folks work at the next level, you just constantly, you realize [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1309.84s)]
*  how small, how little you know, and then you expand again to fit that level and then you move [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1319.28s)]
*  up again and so on. Yeah. Yeah. And that didn't necessarily come real easy to you, given that you [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1325.6799999999998s)]
*  had been studying in a discipline where scientific principles are scientific principles. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1341.76s)]
*  And the business side in there, you know, A plus B could be A1 plus B7 equals C, like there are [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1342.72s)]
*  just so many permutations and variables. Did you struggle with that a little bit? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1350.0800000000002s)]
*  Of course. And, you know, there were just like little snippets. The professor, I went up to the [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1354.5600000000002s)]
*  professor because the professor was, he had an engineering degree and a doctorate in business [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1362.0s)]
*  administration, but an undergraduate degree in engineering. And I asked him, you know, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1367.52s)]
*  you're an engineer. How did you adjust to this? And he said to me, Enrique, the key thing to know [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1372.4s)]
*  is that in business, 80% is good enough. 80% is good enough. Think about that in everything [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1378.8s)]
*  you do in science. If you think 80% of overpasses are safe, is that acceptable? And so this is where [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1384.64s)]
*  it's just the, and so the ambiguity, the ambiguity of business, I think, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1396.4s)]
*  personally, I think always challenges technical and scientific professionals. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1404.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1408.72s)]
*  And when I see even physicians, some of the physicians in the field that I knew that when [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1409.44s)]
*  I got their business background, whatever that happened to be, an executive education [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1415.8400000000001s)]
*  or an MBA, even they told me it is very difficult to make that transition. It is. And so, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1420.56s)]
*  and in some ways, man, you need that. You need that to succeed as an executive in pharma because [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1428.16s)]
*  it's just a different way of approaching things and a different way of speaking to those business [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1444.16s)]
*  professionals when you're not speaking science or technical things, I think. It makes you more [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1450.64s)]
*  effective. Yeah. I mean, long time listeners of the podcast know that I can go long on this topic, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1458.48s)]
*  transition from, you know, and people might get tired of hearing it, but I never get tired of [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1465.2s)]
*  hearing it because every story has its own flavor. You know, every story has its own perspectives [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1469.6000000000001s)]
*  and angles, but I don't want to dwell here too long. I do have one more question for you on this [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1474.48s)]
*  topic though, and it's sort of a philosophical one I'm just interested in your take on. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1480.08s)]
*  You know, you mentioned that you loved the lab and when you began to entertain the concept of [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1485.52s)]
*  going into the business side, your expertise was in making medicine, developing medicine, you know. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1492.56s)]
*  When you make the transition into the business side and you have to gain expertise on running [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1502.6399999999999s)]
*  a business, keeping it profitable, maintaining, you know, maintaining the livelihood of your [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1507.12s)]
*  employees, running an apartment, organizational skills, as in the organization, is it a dangerous [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1512.08s)]
*  place? Can it be a dangerous place to potentially lose sight of the passion around developing [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1522.6399999999999s)]
*  therapeutics and how do you maintain? So two-part question, is there ever a danger that like, hey, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1531.12s)]
*  now I'm a businessman and it's less about the therapeutic development, and how do you avoid it? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1537.12s)]
*  Like, what steps do you take? You personally, what does Enrique Dillonet do when he wakes up in the [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1544.8799999999999s)]
*  morning to say like, you know, it might not just be about the bottom line today, like we need to, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1550.4799999999998s)]
*  you know, maintain our focus on the therapeutic? Does the question make sense? [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1556.4s)]
*  Yeah, no, it totally does. It totally does. So I still remain close to the science. That's how I do [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1561.68s)]
*  it. That's the short answer. For me, even today, on my role in Immunity Bio, I am constantly talking [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1568.64s)]
*  science with folks. And so, but the difference is, and again, this was conversations we had when I [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1577.1200000000001s)]
*  was in business school, you need to be able to pivot. You need to be able to, at one point, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1585.52s)]
*  you're talking in depth characterization of a structural impurity for one hour with folks that [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1590.32s)]
*  are all scientists. And then in the next hour, you're talking with the commercial operations [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1598.32s)]
*  team on supply chain and order to cash and all these other things. And you have to be able to [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1605.2s)]
*  compartmentalize the transitions. But it doesn't mean that you've lost touch with the aspects that [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1612.08s)]
*  brought you to ultimately developing medicines for patients. You know, and you can, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1620.48s)]
*  and I would encourage this, I certainly did it, proactively understand the business beyond the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1631.52s)]
*  function that you conduct so that you read about what the company is doing. You understand the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1638.08s)]
*  field of oncology, not like a physician, but to the extent that you can. So you remain grounded [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1644.48s)]
*  in what you're doing and why you are doing it. While at the same time, when you need to conduct [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1651.6799999999998s)]
*  business, you go and conduct business. And so I was able to do this, man, I personally think, [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1656.8s)]
*  for two reasons, education, but there's also mentorship. There were people who took me under [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1664.88s)]
*  their wing and showed me this, showed me how this is done. Exposed me, for example, to a senior [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1669.5200000000002s)]
*  leadership team conversation where it just went all over the place. And so you just absorb all [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1677.2s)]
*  this information. And you don't realize at the time you are absorbing it. But if you're intent, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1682.88s)]
*  if you're present, you absorb it. And when you move to the next position, you remember all this, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1689.2800000000002s)]
*  it all of a sudden comes out. And so there's that, but you have to have a, which I firmly believe [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1694.88s)]
*  this has helped me quite a bit. You have to have a mindset of continuous learning. You have to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1703.2800000000002s)]
*  constantly be open to just different things and be exposed and be a little bit [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1709.2800000000002s)]
*  honored sometimes, you know, about where you, the path you're on. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1716.64s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very good. All right. We're going to, you gave me a good segue. You mentioned [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1722.3200000000002s)]
*  already, you mentioned immunity bio. So I want to kind of transition to that conversation. You [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1727.68s)]
*  joined immunity as chief tech officer last summer. That was in advance of ANCTIVA's approval. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1733.52s)]
*  So, so a multi-part question. We'll start, we'll take them one at a time. One, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1743.6000000000001s)]
*  how did you, how did you come across the opportunity? What landed you at ANCTIVA? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1747.76s)]
*  So I was, I was consulting for immunity bio. And, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1752.48s)]
*  Oh, I said ANCTIVA, didn't I? I said, what landed you at ANCTIVA? Well, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  what landed you at, at immunity bio? You were consulting for them. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1761.8400000000001s)]
*  I was consulting for them. I was consulting. I understand CMC regulatory affairs in depth. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1766.0800000000002s)]
*  And so that was what I was doing for them, helping them with strategy, guiding them. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1773.44s)]
*  And, and that's how I get, I got connected with the company. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1779.3600000000001s)]
*  So your, your initial consulting gig with them, and then what, what led up to your hiring as chief [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1783.68s)]
*  technology officer, I'd like some sense from a sort of continuum standpoint, like the chronology of, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1790.16s)]
*  of immunity bios work on ANCTIVA and the lead up to its approval. What was strategic about [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1798.08s)]
*  bringing you on in that consulting capacity? And then what was strategic about bringing you [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1804.0s)]
*  on as chief technology officer at that particular point in time? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1808.1599999999999s)]
*  The CMC aspects of the, of the BLA [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1818.72s)]
*  just, just needed that connection with a regulatory affairs expert. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1821.84s)]
*  They, they, that, that connection was needed. Somebody to bring in, not just a technical [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1829.52s)]
*  perspective about there's all, cause there were, I mean, BLA is a complex projects. And there was [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1836.72s)]
*  just a lot of know-how around the BLA. But I think there was, they needed, someone sort of needed to [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1844.16s)]
*  just kind of distill what we were trying to do and sort of guide it. I mean, in CMC and provide [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1854.3200000000002s)]
*  that distillation of what needed to happen to the senior leadership of immunity bio. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1865.44s)]
*  And that was key. That was, cause I mean, the, the, you know, the senior leadership of immunity [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1874.16s)]
*  bio understood what needed to happen. They understood it was just a question of, can somebody [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1880.0800000000002s)]
*  just sort of coalesce this strategy? And, you know, I mean, it was just a lot. The review was, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1886.0800000000002s)]
*  was the review was, it was, it was intense. It was intense. And, you know, I, I understood it. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1895.0400000000002s)]
*  I, but I, and so what I did there with that was able to two pieces, right? I was able to [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1903.92s)]
*  first just gain the trust of the team. Cause I, I wasn't going to come in and sort of, you know, I, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, this whole years and down mindset that I don't work like that. So I needed to just get to, [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1921.28s)]
*  let me get the lay of the land and understand who knows what work across the team and begin [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1926.96s)]
*  to put people at ease with what Enrique is trying to accomplish. And so I did that with the team. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1932.48s)]
*  I did that with my manager and ultimately I did it with the senior leadership of immunity bio, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1939.3600000000001s)]
*  which was key. The folks like the CEO, the chairman, the COO, they, they eventually [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1944.48s)]
*  got to a point where like this guy knows what he's doing, not just technically and regulatory, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1952.48s)]
*  but he also has this, this calming influence of being able to sort of bridge the various [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1958.48s)]
*  disciplines and, and, um, work with the senior leadership to, to get things done. Yeah. That, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1965.2s)]
*  that was, and that's again, uh, it goes back, Matt, I was taught all that. I was, I was, uh, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1972.8000000000002s)]
*  somebody took me under their wing and showed me how to work with folks in positions of power. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1982.16s)]
*  And, and even when you know more about the specific topic than they do, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1988.48s)]
*  there's a certain way that these things need to be conveyed for people who feel at ease with me. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1992.88s)]
*  And then ultimately they make a decision whether to follow your advice or not as a consultant. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=1998.3200000000002s)]
*  And that was another thing that, that whole year that I consulted, expanded muscles and grew [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2004.48s)]
*  muscles that I didn't know I had. I, you, when you're a consultant, again, it's a different, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2011.44s)]
*  it's a different gig. You're not making decisions, but you want folks to have a very clear, [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2016.72s)]
*  um, very clear path and options for the decisions, the decisions that you're asking them to make. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2024.24s)]
*  So, I mean, that was, so that was the first piece. And then ultimately an opportunity opened up [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2032.24s)]
*  and, and, and that's when they made a decision. They said, you know, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2039.6000000000001s)]
*  we, we would, we would like to potentially bring you on a CTO. And by that point, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2044.0s)]
*  the, the, the complete response letter had happened and everything else. But I understood [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2052.72s)]
*  again, after a year of work, fairly in depth on needed to be done. And, and, and then I had the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2058.08s)]
*  relationships to be able to work with those folks. It wasn't something that I was going to do alone. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2066.24s)]
*  And I knew it. Yeah. Um, when, when you, when you entertain the opportunity to become a full-time [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2071.3599999999997s)]
*  employee, was there a party that was like, I'm kind of enjoying this consultancy thing. Like, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2079.6s)]
*  you know, I'm, I'm able to, like you said, flex and grow these muscles, not ultimately, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2084.16s)]
*  ultimately the decision-making power does not fall within me. I like, I like the guidance I can, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2089.2799999999997s)]
*  I can offer. Um, was there a party that was kind of like, ah, you know, I don't know. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2094.3199999999997s)]
*  No, I actually felt the opposite. I, I, I wanted to be part of a team again. I really did. I felt, [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2100.0800000000004s)]
*  I really felt like I, I, because that was what I was used to. I was used to, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2112.5600000000004s)]
*  Matt, when you work this hard on something this complicated, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  you, it becomes part of you. Yeah. You know, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're so invested in [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2124.0s)]
*  excess sets that, that you, and so that's, that's how I felt. That was elated actually when they [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2130.3999999999996s)]
*  came and it was a surprise, but I, I said, Hey, you know, I, I, and then I, I, I had laid out what [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2137.12s)]
*  I thought needed to happen and, and very quickly, uh, kind of assimilated into the company. Yeah. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2145.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's awesome. Um, tell, tell me about the, you know, when you're invested [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2152.2400000000002s)]
*  in a project and you're invested in a team and you're invested in a company and, uh, and you're [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2160.16s)]
*  making good progress and you're seeing light at the end of the tunnel and then you receive a complete [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2164.7200000000003s)]
*  response letter, what's the, what's the prevailing, uh, emotion? What's the prevailing until [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2169.28s)]
*  intellectual reaction? Like, gimme, gimme some color on that experience. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2176.4s)]
*  Um, you're the look, I mean, the first word that comes to my mind is, is, is loss. Yeah. But, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2184.8s)]
*  but not like you lose more like just the sense of loss that you, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2191.76s)]
*  you know, you, you sort of get to that point and, and you're sort of taken back a little bit at, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2197.2s)]
*  at the outcome. Um, so I had been, I had been in multiple marketing applications and I had worked [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2208.72s)]
*  on some that had not proceeded to approval, but it was primarily because of the, something happened [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2217.9199999999996s)]
*  on the efficacy side. Um, this was primarily a CMC thing. And so for me, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2226.4s)]
*  again, it went from loss to very quickly that same night, man, I tell you that same night, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2237.6s)]
*  immediately my wheels began turning very quickly and just reading the whole thing and assimilating [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2246.0s)]
*  and making plans in my head immediately. Just immediately, you know, you get a sense of loss, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2254.32s)]
*  but then very quickly as a pro, you sort of just put your head back on and okay, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2260.0800000000004s)]
*  I see what we need to do here. And I see that how we would craft that response. And I understand. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  And so that was immediately there, but it took about, I don't know, 10 minutes to get there. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2271.04s)]
*  10 minutes. Wow. I can't wait. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2278.56s)]
*  10 minutes to, it was just because you're shocked. You're in shock. Sure. You're in shock. And then [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2281.84s)]
*  all of a sudden, you know, you get the document and you begin, okay, okay, I understand. I understand [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2289.04s)]
*  what we need to do. And then very quickly you, and so immediately, of course you huddle again, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2296.4s)]
*  right? It's almost like you need another shot on goal. So you huddle very quickly. And I had, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2302.72s)]
*  again, Matt, I had the benefit of just having been through this before [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2310.08s)]
*  in assessing regulatory submissions and understanding CRLs and just being able to, okay, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2314.88s)]
*  is this surmountable or not? What are the things we need to do here or there? And so all that played [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2321.28s)]
*  a role in my head. And so very quickly we began, let's get back on the horse and get this done. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2327.6s)]
*  Yeah. I love 10 minutes. I was going to say, I can't wait until my kids are mature enough to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2334.48s)]
*  condense their time of sorrow after a loss or a poor test result to 10 minutes. I always tell them, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2341.44s)]
*  as their dad, I always tell them, you get a day, you get a day to be down. Tomorrow you collect [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2348.08s)]
*  yourself and you move on. I mean, Enrique Dillonet, he does it in 10 minutes. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2353.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2357.92s)]
*  Matt, I mean, remember that [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2359.0400000000004s)]
*  I just couldn't afford to, I just couldn't afford to, I don't know if you've heard of [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2365.0400000000004s)]
*  Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know, I can't be depressed. I'm too busy. You know, so you [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2371.92s)]
*  immediately pivot, you know, you immediately pivot and what we need to do, what do we need to do? [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2379.52s)]
*  And so that's the mode I got into. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2383.44s)]
*  Yeah. And ultimately succeeded. And I guess that's where I want to take the conversation next is [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2388.48s)]
*  into a discussion around your role now in terms of, you know, what role you play in the, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2395.44s)]
*  I mean, the launch, it's a brand new approval. So the launch and the maintenance of this [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2403.6s)]
*  newly approved biologic, as well as [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2407.84s)]
*  what your role is going to look like moving forward in terms of the pipeline that follows. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2413.28s)]
*  But let's start with Antiva. Are you still playing an active role in- [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2418.48s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah, very much so. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2422.96s)]
*  Is that the bulk of your responsibility? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2424.48s)]
*  Yeah. I would still say that the bulk of my work is still Antiva. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2426.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  So with Antiva, you know, again, what Antiva allowed us to do is that it became, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2431.12s)]
*  and it always happens whenever a company has its first approval, that approval [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2442.64s)]
*  becomes an opportunity to mature. It just is. For a company that's worked for a long time in [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2450.0s)]
*  clinical development, immediately there's just things that begin getting flexed, [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2456.48s)]
*  muscles that begin getting flexed, and areas of the company that you interact with that prior to [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2463.44s)]
*  that were sort of coming along, but were not mature and on the tip of the spear function, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2468.48s)]
*  commercial operations, accounting. You know, I mean, you have to do all this. You're a public [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2477.52s)]
*  company and everything else, but now there's all these things that you have, all these processes [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2482.4s)]
*  you need to get into because of an approval, right? And so managing the commercial business [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2487.04s)]
*  becomes an imperative immediately. And typically in companies that have their first approval, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2494.2400000000002s)]
*  there's various degrees of experience in the staff. You know, you're not in a Merck or a large [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2501.6800000000003s)]
*  company that has a strong set commercial arm that, you know, now you, so that's a lot of what we had [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2509.04s)]
*  to do. And I, you know, in manufacturing operations, but also working with my colleagues in other, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2516.32s)]
*  you know, the business units. And then of course, Matt, very quickly, fast, enabling distribution [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2524.24s)]
*  and launch. The approval is not where technical operations finishes, right? And we very quickly [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2530.8s)]
*  have to pivot to getting product ready for distribution and subsequently getting in the [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2539.76s)]
*  mindset of all the department heads that commercial operations basically begins to just take over your [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2545.44s)]
*  life, begins to take over your work life. You still need to manage all the clinical development, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2554.5600000000004s)]
*  but commercial operations, if there's anything with commercial ops, it takes precedence. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2559.76s)]
*  Yeah. And that was, in my opinion, the biggest shift. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2564.48s)]
*  What are some of the, I mean, we could teach a college dissertation, I'm sure, on the tasks [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2569.5200000000004s)]
*  and responsibilities of a chief technical officer in terms of commercial operations, but what are [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2577.84s)]
*  some of the keys? Like when that happened and that became your focus, what were some of the [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2583.28s)]
*  key perhaps decisions that you and other leadership at immunity made, whether it be hires or, you know, [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2589.44s)]
*  bringing in thought leadership in new areas, bulking up in terms of staff? What were some [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2596.96s)]
*  of the keys that are enabling the successful translation from approval to commercial success? [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2604.48s)]
*  Because that's, I mean, that's a stumbling block for a lot of people. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2612.96s)]
*  The number one is the right expertise in supply chain. From an operations perspective, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2616.7200000000003s)]
*  it is a function that is basically during the clinical years, you're basically [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2627.6000000000004s)]
*  labeling, producing and labeling clinical supplies and distributing them. Right? So it's sort of, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2635.44s)]
*  that's what you're doing. And then you have to manage immunity bias vertically integrated. So we [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2642.56s)]
*  have all these facilities that we have to manage and all that. But then once you get to commercial [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2647.76s)]
*  operations, the supply chain team is key. There's just a lot that you have to understand in so far [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2654.72s)]
*  as distribution, you have to work on order to cash, order fulfillment, things like titles, 3PLs, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2662.96s)]
*  all these things that you could work a lifetime in clinical development and you never get exposed [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2670.0s)]
*  to. You're never exposed to that kind of thing. And so all those things related. And then of course, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2675.6s)]
*  then what happens is supply chain sort of leads some of this, right? But you need quality control, [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2682.8s)]
*  you need quality assurance, you need external manufacturing, all these other functions that [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2690.48s)]
*  need to understand the trivial things, change controls, deviations, whatever it is, all these [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2696.48s)]
*  quality processes, all of a sudden become limiting reagents. You have to move in a compliant, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2705.44s)]
*  GMP way, but you have to move the product in order to get that order fulfillment and all these other [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2715.12s)]
*  things that when you're over here, you're primarily concerned with avoiding drug holidays in any of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2721.6s)]
*  your clinical trials. That's the key. You want consistent supply of your clinic, clinical materials. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2729.2799999999997s)]
*  Over here is more increasingly becomes a lifeblood of the company. And so that vision, you need to [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2735.04s)]
*  make it very clear to folks so that they crystallize because many folks have never worked in a [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2740.56s)]
*  commercial environment. Did you have to bring on additional staff in terms of supply chain and [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2746.08s)]
*  quality or were you able to work with the staff that you had that had been managing? [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2753.84s)]
*  So that's a work in progress. That's a work in progress. Again, it's inevitable that [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2758.24s)]
*  some areas we have had to, we need this person focused on commercial or, [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2766.96s)]
*  you know, and of course, when you are at this stage of the company, you get immediate buy-in. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2772.3999999999996s)]
*  I need somebody completely focused on Antiva in this business function. I can't have this person [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2780.24s)]
*  be worried about clinical supplies or anything like that. And of course, it immediately happens. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2788.3999999999996s)]
*  So, which is, again, it just, you know, people understand the urgency. And [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2795.76s)]
*  unless you've worked in commercial operations, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2804.16s)]
*  it's difficult, Matt. Development folks don't have the, typically, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2809.92s)]
*  don't have the same level of urgency in my experience. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2817.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2821.28s)]
*  The timeframes are just longer. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2826.08s)]
*  The timeframes are longer. The work is, I mean, not that the work is, you know, urgency. There's [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2828.2400000000002s)]
*  like an urgency continuum, right? Exactly right. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2835.92s)]
*  The urgency, the long-term urgency is there. The urgency to create patient benefit is certainly [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2839.28s)]
*  there, but there's not necessarily a dollar figure or a survival aspect that's imminent, [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2845.84s)]
*  in this commercial capacity. Yep. And quarterly earnings. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2856.4s)]
*  Wall Street immediately, you know, all these things. So, it's okay. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2861.84s)]
*  So, that's the, and I understood that. I understood that that was coming. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2866.8s)]
*  And so, that was another key transition for us. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2872.16s)]
*  And so far, so good. So far, so good. Yeah. It's early. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2879.68s)]
*  So far, so good. Yeah, it'll be great to watch. I mean, it's early, but in this short time frame, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2883.04s)]
*  since approval, and, you know, I mean, a lot of this work, the preparation happens, I'm sure, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2890.0s)]
*  before, when the writing begins to appear on the wall, you start to mobilize. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2893.68s)]
*  But in the short time, since the approval, looking back on that short period of time, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2899.68s)]
*  are there any, like, specific pieces of advice that you've already, maybe, from lessons already [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2906.56s)]
*  learned that you would share with someone in your role for the first time? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2914.16s)]
*  The key is the devil is in the detail for launch. And especially with a company [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2919.8399999999997s)]
*  that has never launched a product, there needs to be this, again, the CTO needs to be involved [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2927.6s)]
*  at a fairly detailed level with the various business units in manufacturing and quality [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2937.44s)]
*  and supply chain to make sure that everything is meshing, that everything is moving and [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2945.6s)]
*  be aware of any specific bottlenecks. Many times, Matt, it's not anything that anyone is doing, [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2954.56s)]
*  it's just something, a process that was created under clinical development, that under manufacturing, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2962.08s)]
*  operations for commercial does not make sense anymore. There's something that, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2971.52s)]
*  and it made complete sense while you were in development, but now it doesn't. And so [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2980.1600000000003s)]
*  we ran into that a couple of times, but we were able to work through it because [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2987.04s)]
*  we all worked together very intently at a very detailed level. So my advice is, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2990.4s)]
*  for any CTO that is going through this for the first time, make sure you are in the details [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=2998.7200000000003s)]
*  and that you understand the flows of what needs to happen when to get your product launched. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3007.36s)]
*  Beyond Antiva, I can't let this conversation go any further without [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3015.76s)]
*  referencing what I said early on about this aggressive pipeline that comes in [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3022.16s)]
*  beyond Antiva. We don't need to get into great detail around clinical progress in each of those [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3027.52s)]
*  programs. The overarching question is, when you have the responsibilities that come with this [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3033.8399999999997s)]
*  commercial rollout, and then behind that you have this beautiful, as I said, aggressive stacked [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3041.52s)]
*  pipeline of potential, what's your obligation to what comes next? And how do you balance your [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3050.8s)]
*  47 hours per day that apparently you're working? How do you appropriate your time and attention [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3063.44s)]
*  appropriately? So for somebody said to me in the company that I'm drinking from a fire hose right [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3071.36s)]
*  now, which it's typical at this stage, having been with the company less than a year, [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3083.84s)]
*  I think I crystallize it in a very simple way, man. We are focused as an organization [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3090.32s)]
*  in manufacturing operations in making sure that our patients have high quality [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3102.0s)]
*  product at the right time, at the right place, in the right quantity. And so that's key. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3112.56s)]
*  That's the key. And so it's a question of, how do I work with my direct reports to make sure [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3119.84s)]
*  that I'm aware of each of those aspects in the portfolio that we're managing? And also, [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3127.5200000000004s)]
*  I work with the CEO, the COO, the chairman to make sure that we all agree on exactly what are we [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3135.36s)]
*  trying to accomplish for the year to support that pipeline? And is it possible for us to do it with [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3146.4s)]
*  the resources we have? But yes, my responsibility is manufacturing. So we manufacture all the [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3154.4s)]
*  products of the company of immunity by whether internally or externally. And so for that, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3161.2000000000003s)]
*  I am constantly, constantly in updates, meetings, reviewing reports, reviewing regulatory submissions, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3168.0s)]
*  but it's driven primarily by what I think are, what I know are the priorities for the business [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3177.76s)]
*  unit. And that reflects what is a priority for the company. And so that, and Matt, I preach this [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3185.84s)]
*  constantly to the group, that mantra of, this is our focus for this year. Overall, the number one [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3194.4s)]
*  objective is to continue to provide products for all our patients. But underneath that, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3202.2400000000002s)]
*  there's yearly metrics that we have to meet. And I keep focused on those metrics. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3207.92s)]
*  And so that's how I manage it. And so you have to do it this way, because in my opinion, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3215.04s)]
*  it has to be systematic. So that's how I do it. Yeah. How often do those priorities, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3221.04s)]
*  I mean, you've been in biotech for quite some time now. So I'm talking immunity, bio and previous, [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3231.36s)]
*  beyond. How often are you reassessing and perhaps adjusting those priorities? I mean, it's got to be [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3238.64s)]
*  depending on the market. There's so many factors, right? Depending on the market and the patient [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3248.48s)]
*  population and the competitive landscape, priorities often shift and change. Do you have [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3254.1600000000003s)]
*  to be on your toes in terms of like, these are our priorities for this year? And maybe six months [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3260.32s)]
*  down the road, we'll be like, ah, you know, we're going to shift that priority a little bit. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3265.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, but then, yeah, but there's also processes that we've instituted to keep track of this. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3269.2000000000003s)]
*  Formal and informal to make sure we are aligned with where the company is going. And so it's a [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3274.64s)]
*  constant thing. It's a constant conversation. Many times, and what happens many times, Matt, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3282.7999999999997s)]
*  is that there's conversations on my level and maybe one level below, and they don't go any further. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3293.12s)]
*  Mm hmm. Because we're just assessing things, right? Yeah. And you're assessing various things. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3298.72s)]
*  Okay, are we going to pursue that? And there was a little bit of a flurry of activity around [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3306.16s)]
*  a particular indication or a market or something. And it takes place. You get pulled into it. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3311.92s)]
*  But then two or three weeks later, now there was a decision not to move forward with that. So you [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3319.2799999999997s)]
*  have to be judicious in what you bring to your staff so that the staff remains focused. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3325.92s)]
*  Yeah. And so you, but as a C-level executive, you just have to go with the flow on that. It's [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3331.2000000000003s)]
*  part of the armor that you have to have built in order to succeed in this role. And so, [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3338.08s)]
*  and I'm doing the same thing for the folks that report to me, my direct reports, it's the same [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3344.88s)]
*  thing. But what I say is, the staff, it wouldn't have helped me when I was an associate scientist [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3348.56s)]
*  at Roche to understand all the strategies that we're pursuing. I just needed to do my testing. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3358.88s)]
*  I needed to do my testing and remain focused. And so that's sort of the mindset that I've [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3364.16s)]
*  created within manufacturing operations so that people are focused on what we need to do [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3373.04s)]
*  for the day. Now, do I still talk about the high-level objectives? Yes. The high-level [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3378.0s)]
*  objectives are here. And then once in a while, Matt, if you need to shift and accommodate [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3385.04s)]
*  the actual plan, that's done systematically. Well, this trial or that trial didn't give us [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3393.68s)]
*  what we needed. So we're going to pivot to this. And then we work in a very systematic [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3401.84s)]
*  and very open so that folks understand what is happening. And it's just, oh, I see. I see. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3407.76s)]
*  Okay. So we have to adjust that direction. And instead of making this, we're producing that. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3416.8s)]
*  Or instead of doing that submission, we're working on this other submission. So that's how we do it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3422.96s)]
*  Yeah. All right. We're running a bit short on time here, Enrique. So I got just a couple more [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3430.0s)]
*  questions for you and then we'll wrap things up. Sure. If you're looking at sort of your immediate [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3435.28s)]
*  short-term future in terms of what's next for you in immunity bio, what does that look like? [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3441.84s)]
*  What's going to keep Enrique's plate full for the next, I don't know, six, eight, 12 months and beyond? [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3450.48s)]
*  Yeah. So I mean, it's still going to be Activa. It's additional indications and additional [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3457.2s)]
*  territories. We got it approved in the US. We were just announced in the shareholders meeting that [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3466.64s)]
*  we're going to EMA. We're going to EMA with Activa. So that's a huge endeavor. And then [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3475.6s)]
*  there's additional indications that we are pursuing. So that continues to take, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3483.04s)]
*  and will continue to take, quite a bit of my time and quite a bit of the team's time to be able to [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3490.64s)]
*  go through that. But there's also metrics that we have for the other products, for the other platforms, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3498.8s)]
*  specific things that we have committed ourselves to. We're in the middle of those right now. They're [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3505.6000000000004s)]
*  very intense. And so we have to get those done. And so I'm, again, keeping my pulse on those things. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3513.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3522.8s)]
*  You know, just constantly discussions on a daily basis, man. To the point where [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3526.0s)]
*  we understand what is happening on the manufacturing floor. You have to, you go that far. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3534.6400000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, it's just what you have to do. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3541.44s)]
*  I lied. I have more than two more questions for you because you brought it up. You brought up the [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3545.84s)]
*  move into EMA. You got on time just for a few more minutes? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3551.12s)]
*  Sure. Sure. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3554.48s)]
*  All right. What do you have to do to tool up to go do business in Europe and approach the EMA? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3555.12s)]
*  Do you have consultants on the ground over there? Have you hired like EMA, [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3563.2s)]
*  you know, people with EMA regulatory experience? Is that something that you [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3567.68s)]
*  bring to the table from private previous experience? I'm just curious. [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3572.24s)]
*  So I've done marketing applications in Europe before, but yes, the company is, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3575.36s)]
*  as a business, we need to line up things in Europe in order to be successful. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3582.0s)]
*  So that's part of what's happened. What is happening internally with a lot of, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3587.84s)]
*  with the marketing application is that there's just now more people that need to get up to speed [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3594.8799999999997s)]
*  with the product. And that's a big thing for me. From a CMC perspective, I need to make sure [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3606.08s)]
*  that the folks that are ultimately are going to go and help us get the marketing application [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3614.0s)]
*  approved from a CMC perspective, half the background. It takes months to be ready for [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3620.8s)]
*  something like that. And so that's a big, one of my big priorities right now. I have to get the [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3628.8s)]
*  team ready for that application. I can't wait. By the time the application is sent, it's too late. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3636.48s)]
*  And so that's part of what we're doing now. That's a very important [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3643.6800000000003s)]
*  preparation that we're doing. And as usual, the Europeans, they have their own spin. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3654.32s)]
*  It always happens. Well, I mean, that's why there's an FDA and an EMA and not an FDA and EMA. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3662.48s)]
*  Yeah, it's okay. It's all good. It's all good. It's just a different take, but it's all good. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3668.96s)]
*  I quite enjoy it. I quite enjoy it. Yeah, very good. Okay. So then looking a little bit further [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3675.6s)]
*  beyond, I would say not that I'm going to ask you to pick a favorite second child, but are there any [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3682.08s)]
*  programs of the many at Immunity Bio that have you perhaps excited more than others or that you're [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3689.68s)]
*  very much looking forward to working on once ANKTIVA is a self-propelled machine? [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3696.96s)]
*  I mean, so Immunity Bio has a great vaccine platform, ad-fi vaccine platform for cancer. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3704.32s)]
*  And there's just very fertile ground there, I would say that. And that's something that [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3711.28s)]
*  I'm personally very excited about. And of course, also the cell therapy. The cell therapy business [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3719.92s)]
*  is, again, it's a very interesting business, how close you are to the patient and [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3726.16s)]
*  how quickly that needs to be turned around, the logistical challenges, the [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3735.12s)]
*  simple things, Matt, like how do you release those things quickly so that you can dose the patient [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3745.92s)]
*  quickly? All these things are things that have me very excited and we're working on right now. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3752.4s)]
*  And that was one thing. I didn't say that at the beginning, but I'm sort of a jack of all trades [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3765.12s)]
*  in CMC. I've done every modality. And so that was another thing that excited me about Immunity Bio. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3770.64s)]
*  It was just a good fit. They didn't need somebody who's solely focused on a particular technology, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3778.88s)]
*  but somebody who was able to move around in the various technologies that they have in their [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3784.88s)]
*  portfolio. And so we're doing that now. And again, on a daily basis, Matt, oh, and Ricky, today we [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3790.56s)]
*  have to do this on this product, that on that product, and this on this other product. And you [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3802.56s)]
*  just go through your day. Sometimes my, I mean, I'm sure you know this, but my day is booked [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3808.4s)]
*  from beginning to end with meetings on 10 different topics. And so you just need to keep your head and [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3814.0s)]
*  go through each one of them. That I learned in small pharma, that jump of just managing and [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3820.7999999999997s)]
*  wearing so many hats and giving advice, sometimes making decisions. Other times, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3829.84s)]
*  you're not the primary player. It's a process scientist who understands better, way better than [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3837.28s)]
*  you specifically what needs to happen with that chromatography column. And you just have to [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3842.2400000000002s)]
*  question and guide him to the answer. Oh, I still love drug development. I love it. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3847.28s)]
*  I can see it in your eyes. I was thinking as you were just kind of wrapping that thought up, [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3852.8s)]
*  I was thinking like this guy thrives on the diversity of the challenges at hand. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3861.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think that takes a special personality. And training. I mean, you talked about the training. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3870.0s)]
*  You talked about your commitment to improving in areas where you needed to improve. But I think [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3875.04s)]
*  underneath all that, you're a special guy who's doing special work. And I can appreciate just [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3882.7200000000003s)]
*  watching you as you speak the way that you thrive on it. Thank you. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3888.96s)]
*  I mentioned that I had Dr. Reddy on the show several weeks ago, several episodes ago. I [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3896.6400000000003s)]
*  believe it was 197. He appealed to my emotions as well, just for the very work that you guys are [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3903.28s)]
*  doing. Because as I said, my father has been successfully working his way through [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3909.68s)]
*  NIMI BC for a few years now. So I just want to take a minute to thank you guys again for the [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3918.24s)]
*  work that you're doing. It's awesome work. And I want to thank you for your thoughtful and [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3923.68s)]
*  contemplative responses and transparency to my questions today. You've been a good sport. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3929.7599999999998s)]
*  Thank you. I appreciate it, Matt. I really appreciate the opportunity. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3935.12s)]
*  We'll have you on again. You're one of my favorite companies now because of this emotional soft spot [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3938.48s)]
*  I have. So we'll get you back. Thanks a lot. I look forward to it. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3943.68s)]
*  So that's Immunity Bio Chief Technology Officer Dr. Enrique Dillonet. I'm Matt Piller. You just [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3949.6s)]
*  listened to the business of biotech. We're proudly supporting BioProcess Online's BioExpo Live, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn3K9JciCfQ&t=3956.16s)]
