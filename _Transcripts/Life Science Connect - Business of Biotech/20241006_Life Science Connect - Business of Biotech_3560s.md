Video Description: Mike Kelly faced a self-reckoning before he took the job as CEO at NervGen, a company developing peptide therapeutics targeted specifically at central nervous system repair. The veteran of life sciences business development knew the ropes of the biotech C-suite. He’d been a CEO twice before. He knew how to launch drugs, having seen commercial success several times before. He even knew how to sell them—he’d started his career carrying the bag for TAP Pharmaceuticals. But all he knew about peptides was that they were challenging to manufacture consistently and purify. And he knew that manufacturing is where a lot of biopharma companies fall down. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we learn how Kelly reconciled that truth, and how NervGen is now leading the way for peptide therapeutics in spinal cord injury and beyond.

# The Peptide Promise With NervGen Pharma's Mike Kelly
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ)
*  Mike Kelly tells me the human nervous system's response to traumatic injury or disease is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=0.0s)]
*  pretty good at isolating the damage, but not so great at repair. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=10.84s)]
*  His company, NerveGen, is seeking to bridge that gap between nervous system protection [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=16.84s)]
*  and repair with the development of therapeutic peptides. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=22.6s)]
*  The lead in its lineup is a peptide that's currently targeting spinal cord injury in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=27.2s)]
*  a Phase 1B 2A trial, but the company has stroke, Alzheimer's, MS, and ALS programs in its discovery [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  and preclinical pipeline as well. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=40.16s)]
*  Peptides are a modality that color outside the lines a bit. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=44.04s)]
*  The FDA, which has been averaging a couple of peptide approvals per year, sometimes considers [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  them a biologic, sometimes not a biologic, and they're generally considered neither a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=54.96s)]
*  large molecule nor a small one by standard measures, but in some instances that gives [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=60.68s)]
*  them a leg up in terms of vascular permeability and bioavailability. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=66.6s)]
*  And as we know, they're awfully buzzy in the obesity space right now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=72.16s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  This is the Business of Biotech, and on today's episode, we'll get to know Mike Kelly. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  We'll learn his view on where peptides fit on the biopharmaceutical landscape. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=82.8s)]
*  We'll learn about NerveGen's peptide and the steps the company has taken and the ones it's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=88.24s)]
*  taking now to pave the path for commercial prep, which, by the way, Kelly has plenty [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=94.0s)]
*  of experience with. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  Mike, welcome to the show. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=101.24s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  Nice to be here. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  I'm super happy to have you here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=105.8s)]
*  And I like to start out with a little bit of background, let our audience get to know [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=107.72s)]
*  you a little bit. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=111.24s)]
*  And, you know, the thing that strikes me about you right off the bat is that you're a business [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=112.24s)]
*  guy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  You got an undergrad, I think, in a business degree. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=117.11999999999999s)]
*  You earned your MBA, that is. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=119.24s)]
*  You have zero academic scientific training yet since 1991, not to age you, but since [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  1991, you've been working in business development and senior leadership positions for life sciences [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=129.6s)]
*  companies pretty much exclusively. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=138.0s)]
*  And in fact, you're currently on your third stint, I believe, as a biotech CEO. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=140.11999999999998s)]
*  So it begs the question, why life sciences? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=145.64s)]
*  How did you get into life sciences and why? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=148.6s)]
*  How did I get in? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=151.88s)]
*  Well, I actually started out as many folks do in sales. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  I started my my career in pharmaceuticals and carrying the bag and walking into doctor's [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=157.27999999999997s)]
*  offices talking about therapies that could help their patients. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=162.23999999999998s)]
*  And why I got into it was at the time, there were some people in my life that were mentors [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=166.68s)]
*  of mine that I really respected and had many conversations with, and they loved their jobs. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=173.0s)]
*  And I got the the ish to get into the field. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=177.8s)]
*  And that's kind of I lived in Jersey. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  So I went up and down Route one, just like most college grads do, handing out resumes [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  to all the HR departments that were, you know, J and J, the likes of the people that I was [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=190.36s)]
*  all the way. You know, every single pharmaceutical company under the sun was on Route one. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=196.48000000000002s)]
*  So, you know, you try to get in at any at any level. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=200.6s)]
*  And then through a friend, I was introduced to TAP Pharmaceuticals, which was my first role [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=205.16s)]
*  in the industry. So, you know, that's how I got in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=210.16s)]
*  Why why I stayed in and why I pursued higher levels of my career is just the gratitude [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=212.96s)]
*  of being able to do something you like to do, grow personally, but also, you know, help [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=219.6s)]
*  people that and people don't truly think of commercial and marketing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=226.8s)]
*  when they think of pharmaceuticals. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=232.20000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, the commercial side of business is just like any other business. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=233.52s)]
*  You know, even though there's novel things that are coming out every day, being approved, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=238.88s)]
*  you know, weekly from the FDA, you have to still connect those with patients and physicians [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=243.56s)]
*  and teach, you know, teach the world what it is and how they how it can help them. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=250.36s)]
*  Some are obviously a little bit more in your face than others, but, you know, they all have to be [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=254.28s)]
*  educated and brought awareness around. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=259.0s)]
*  And and so that was really the driver for me to continue going because I really like doing that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=261.32s)]
*  Yeah. You told me the last time we spoke, you told me that I think your very first job out of college, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  maybe, was in like business system sales, like copy copyers and fax machines and stuff. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=272.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I sold I sold copiers for Pitney Bowes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=277.12s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, you know, back back then, that was probably a pretty good gig. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it's probably been 20 years since anybody's been in the office to service our copy machine. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=284.12s)]
*  But yeah, it was, you know, it was kind of like I was I was actually when I was going up and down route one, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=289.04s)]
*  I was getting the door slammed in my face and was like that old army commercial, you know, go away, kid. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=294.36s)]
*  You need experience. Yeah. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  And then I had a couple of interviews and they said, listen, if you had really strong sales experience, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  you know, we would consider you. So that's what I did. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=306.0s)]
*  I went and got a couple of years of strong sales experience at selling copiers, which is a humbling job. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=308.08s)]
*  But it also teaches you a lot of skills and went through Pitney Bowes had a phenomenal training program. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=315.96s)]
*  And that's really kind of what that plus getting my MBA, I think, gave me the leg up on others trying to get in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=321.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You know, you talked about the the similarities in in sales, like at that point in your career, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=327.12s)]
*  your new business development sales for for pharma companies. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=334.08s)]
*  You talked about the similarities to like, you know, selling, just selling, selling anything. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=338.32s)]
*  And I can see that, right. Like maybe you're on a product line. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  You get to know that product product line quite well. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=345.91999999999996s)]
*  You get to understand relationships with physicians and develop those relationships. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=348.4s)]
*  And you're selling a thing as your career progressed. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  I'm curious about as your career progressed and you took on more responsibility for, you know, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=358.0s)]
*  not just a product, but perhaps, you know, a pipeline or the development of actual therapeutic products. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=364.52s)]
*  What was the, I guess, motivating factor and what was the recipe for absorbing that and learning it? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=374.84s)]
*  Like becoming becoming a biz dev slash science guy, not just a biz dev guy. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=384.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=391.76s)]
*  I was very fortunate in one of the jobs I had at TAP. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=394.44s)]
*  Well, fortunate and unfortunate, I was supposed to be promoted into a hospital sales job. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=398.35999999999996s)]
*  And we went through restructuring and my house was on the market for sale. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=402.96s)]
*  And I was, you know, moved ready to move to North Jersey via hospital rep in New York. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=407.84s)]
*  And I got a call from the head of specialty sales and says, hold on, you know, take your house off the market. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=411.88s)]
*  We're we're restructuring. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=417.84s)]
*  And so they downsize the hospital group. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=420.44s)]
*  So I was kind of man without a nation for a period of time. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=422.59999999999997s)]
*  And they asked me if I wanted to join this group called Medical Research Associates, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  which in today's terms is an MSL or somebody in medical affairs. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=430.4s)]
*  So I took the job and that was really the immersion for me to show, OK, you think you know, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=435.88s)]
*  you know how to sell, you know, the commercial aspects of the business, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=442.28s)]
*  but you really need to dig deep and understand science. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=445.52s)]
*  And I remember my boss, you know, taking me to the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Library, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  pulling out all of the medical journals and sitting down at a table and saying, OK, read these, I'll be back at lunch. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=457.12s)]
*  And, you know, so it was understanding, knowing in sales and in any kind of communications, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=463.6s)]
*  if you don't know, if you're not a resource to the people you're calling on, you're just noise. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=471.0s)]
*  And so I actually became a resource after that job. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=477.4s)]
*  I realized, OK, this is doctors are busy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=481.88s)]
*  They don't have much time. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=484.44s)]
*  They really need you to focus on how you can help them, how your products can help them. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=485.56s)]
*  And if you don't understand the science, not only the science behind the illness or disease that your product is treating, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=491.32s)]
*  but how your product can impact that disease and what that could potentially translate into from a feature and a benefit perspective. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=499.76s)]
*  That combination really kind of unlocked, you know, open my eyes to, OK, this is this is how it's done. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=508.68s)]
*  You know, this is this is the importance of science. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=515.52s)]
*  And so, you know, I just read a ton and I was self-taught plus company taught to learn the science and worked in many different therapeutic areas. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=518.16s)]
*  You know, I worked in the cath lab when I was at Guilford. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=529.64s)]
*  I worked in neurosurgery, you know, watching glioblastomas be removed from patients brains when they were putting glial way for him. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=534.0s)]
*  So the span of things that you learn over time and the key is you've got to focus specifically. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=543.8399999999999s)]
*  And when a good hospital rep, sales rep, MSL is trained extremely well, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=550.68s)]
*  they probably know as much about a specific area of a disease state and how drugs work in that disease state as the physicians that they're calling on. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=557.9599999999999s)]
*  And that's what a resource is. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=568.0s)]
*  So that that's kind of what really kind of unlocked and it was a aha moment for me. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=569.52s)]
*  Yeah. Did you did you willingly embrace that? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=574.12s)]
*  Did it come naturally to you or was it like really hard? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=577.04s)]
*  No, no, I didn't. I was a I was a cocky sales representative. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=579.68s)]
*  I didn't I didn't I didn't embrace it at first until I saw the power that it could actually have and the impact it could have. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=584.88s)]
*  But, you know, locking yourself in a room and reading fertility and sterility is not fun. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=594.96s)]
*  You know, it wasn't fun for me as a 20 something year old kid. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=600.56s)]
*  But then when you know that my boss back then, Lou Savant is his name, he's probably hopefully he'll listen to this someday. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=605.12s)]
*  But Lou is the guy who really showed me, OK, this is this is how you translate your skill set and you make it much better. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=612.28s)]
*  And that was that's when I started to really read for interest rather than read for a burden. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=621.96s)]
*  A lot of people go into training classes and I got to read all this content. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  There was a transformational moment for me. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=635.5600000000001s)]
*  And I started to read I didn't read fertility and sterility for pleasure, but I read it for for business purposes. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=638.52s)]
*  And I was on the cutting edge of everything that was going on in the field. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=645.6s)]
*  So that when I sat down with the head of the department at a major institution, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=650.08s)]
*  I was a resource and they enjoyed the conversations rather than it was kind of a rather than rather than dropping lunch and brochures. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=655.6s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, very good. I, you know, I I'm tracking here along your career and like that, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=665.0s)]
*  there's like a gain in momentum around that that period. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=671.2800000000001s)]
*  And then if we fast forward to 2013, you joined this was your first CEO role. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=675.36s)]
*  Twenty thirteen, I think you joined Covis. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=682.16s)]
*  Correct. Yeah. And I'm assuming I want to get into this discussion. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=684.96s)]
*  I'm assuming that was another point of momentum gained for you in terms of commercial sort of responsibility because, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=689.12s)]
*  you know, you joined you joined the company in 2013. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=698.7199999999999s)]
*  It had been founded two years, two years prior today. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=701.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, I mean, it's not it wasn't that long ago. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=706.68s)]
*  And today the company's got more than a dozen branded products on the market. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=708.8s)]
*  I'm assuming some of that activity took place under your watch. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=712.64s)]
*  So I'm curious how that experience with a, you know, a new pharmaceutical company that was nimble and fast. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=717.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously, you know, move quickly to get products to market. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=726.68s)]
*  How that sort of shaped your commercial perspective and how it's continued to sort of inform what you're doing today. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=730.16s)]
*  Yeah. So Covis was. Was a pretty simple step for me. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=738.56s)]
*  It wasn't, you know, I didn't it was the two jobs that built me up to get to Covis, really, that built the foundation. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  You know, my first pure startup was two jobs prior to that with a company called Azure. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=751.52s)]
*  We respect pharma business group of five individuals, four of which were in Ireland and me in the US. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=756.6s)]
*  And we we bought products that were kind of either forgotten about or had much more value left. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=764.16s)]
*  And we figured out how to reposition them, how to get more life out of them, how to help more patients with them. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=771.6800000000001s)]
*  And so that led to, you know, they got acquired by Jazz and that built up my commercial experience for a larger organization running much divisions of companies. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=780.6s)]
*  And then and then Covis, what I learned at Covis the most was apologies, but I learned at Covis the most was. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=791.52s)]
*  What I started at Azure and Jazz is you have to build a really strong team. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=800.0400000000001s)]
*  You know, you can be you can have all the knowledge in the world, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  but if you don't have a strong team, a core group of people who are generalists, you can't run a small company. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=812.4s)]
*  And we we had some moving parts when I first joined the organization. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=820.1199999999999s)]
*  It was a small startup, a lot of similarities between Covis and and here I joined here was a very small team. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=826.4399999999999s)]
*  But you have to really build a team with really strong players who have a core focus in a specific area. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=834.64s)]
*  And we call those the crown jewels and they manage that inside. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=842.12s)]
*  But one of the other big things that folks need to be able to do is manage out and outsource partners. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=845.56s)]
*  And if they don't have those capabilities to treat partners like employees and to get enough, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=852.08s)]
*  you know, to have them understand the importance of what they're doing on your behalf, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=860.24s)]
*  then you're a small company trying to work in this big industry. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=866.08s)]
*  So Covis really helped me, you know. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=870.44s)]
*  Solidify all of the learnings that I've had in the two jobs prior to that. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=873.9200000000001s)]
*  Number one, it was it was a good group that I that I started with, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=878.32s)]
*  who was a better group that I helped bring into the organization. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=881.76s)]
*  But then the next big step was prioritization. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=885.8000000000001s)]
*  And I learned that earlier in my career, too. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=889.7199999999999s)]
*  You have to prioritize the products that you're going to work on. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=891.64s)]
*  You have to identify the opportunities where you can actually help more people. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=894.64s)]
*  And that's we had a large portfolio when I joined some of the products for old portfolio that, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  you know, people didn't want to let go of. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=906.1999999999999s)]
*  And I'm like, you got to let go. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=908.5999999999999s)]
*  This is generic size. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=910.04s)]
*  You know, we're we're we're not making money. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=911.7199999999999s)]
*  We're not helping more patients. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=914.3599999999999s)]
*  But this product over here has a significant unmet medical need and a significant opportunity. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=916.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's harder to figure out, but that's why you have to get great people in organization. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=923.52s)]
*  You know, they have to figure, OK, figure it out, figure out how we're going to help more people with this product. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=928.16s)]
*  And that's how you start to build product by product and a portfolio and a team. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=932.64s)]
*  And it starts to grow. So that was really what solidified for me at Covis. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=938.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, when you've got such a large portfolio and you need to make decisions like like you just mentioned, [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=942.84s)]
*  like, hey, you know, this product is it's tapped out. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=947.0400000000001s)]
*  We need to let this go. And you I think you just mentioned that, you know, in some cases, people are are tied to it. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=950.32s)]
*  They're married to it. They may maybe have got some emotional personal stake in it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=955.9200000000001s)]
*  I don't know. Is that a tough part of the job as the leader of the company? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=960.44s)]
*  It is, you know, it is because. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=963.9200000000001s)]
*  You know, it's internal sales, right? [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=968.36s)]
*  You're selling people on your vision as to where you want to take the organization and why you want the organization to go there. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=970.16s)]
*  And not everybody buys in immediately. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=978.2s)]
*  You know, they have to learn in their own way. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=981.52s)]
*  Well, why is this guy doing this? Why are we going down this path? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=984.64s)]
*  And so it's just conversations like this. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=987.4s)]
*  You have you have conversations to really explain what you're doing and why you're doing what you're doing and why you're making the decisions you're making. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=990.0s)]
*  Because if if the team all doesn't agree and doesn't buy in, then, you know, when you only have ten people on the team, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=999.68s)]
*  if one of them doesn't buy in, you know, you're at 90 percent effectiveness if all of the others are working at 100 percent. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1007.68s)]
*  So that that's the other thing you learn in small startups is you got to get everyone to buy in and you got to get everyone focused. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1014.88s)]
*  And everyone's got to be at 110 percent or else you're not going to compete. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. All right. One one more question about your your history, the past. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1027.6s)]
*  Right. And then we'll switch gears and start talking about what's going on at NerveGen and how you're navigating those waters. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1032.52s)]
*  But probably the, you know, probably the most the household name, if you will, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1038.2s)]
*  that you're probably most well known for is the development and commercial availability of of Narcan. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1044.96s)]
*  Right. I mean, everybody knows what that is. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1052.04s)]
*  I'm assuming you played a role in its sale to Emergent for a princely sum. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1054.72s)]
*  So tell me about that. Like, you know, that's another I'm assuming that's another big inflection point in your career that sort of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1061.84s)]
*  informed, inspired, informed, provided some direction as to what what came next. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1069.16s)]
*  Tell me about that experience. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1075.3999999999999s)]
*  Yes. So actually, the team that I talked about that was at Azure earlier prior to Covis was the team that started the development or in license [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1078.12s)]
*  and continued the development of Narcan. And when I was finishing up my term at Covis, [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1087.08s)]
*  I talked to the CEO and founder, CEO Seamus Mulligan, who has been a mentor of mine throughout my career about joining the team. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1094.08s)]
*  And I was trying to trying to finish things at Covis, but had an eye on on helping Narcan. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1103.12s)]
*  So when I got there, they had the framework of a pretty solid team in the U.S. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1109.52s)]
*  marketplace. And I think the biggest transition was, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1115.52s)]
*  number one, stepping into that role, getting to know the people who are currently on the team, [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1120.36s)]
*  but then number two, figuring out the product and how to navigate the waters. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1125.0s)]
*  And then number three, continuing to build out the team to execute. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1130.04s)]
*  It was really all about operational execution at that stage. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1133.56s)]
*  The company had had been trailing a competitor in the FDA review process and the competitor got a complete response letter. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1137.52s)]
*  So they went from bridesmaid to bride overnight. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1145.32s)]
*  And now, you know, there's a very different strategy when you are planning to follow somebody versus planning on leading the way. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1148.52s)]
*  So we had to pivot very quickly and figure it out. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1158.56s)]
*  We knew that we had a device and a drug that can save lives. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1163.12s)]
*  What we didn't know is how are we going to get it into the hands of people who could save those lives? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1167.76s)]
*  And the most logical first step for us was, well, the first people on a scene of an overdose are police. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1172.48s)]
*  And they're not trained. They're not trained medically to treat people, nor do they want to. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1178.92s)]
*  That's not their job. So we actually had to knock down a lot of barriers to [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1183.28s)]
*  allow police to carry the product without a prescription and deliver it to somebody who they thought might be having an overdose. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1188.32s)]
*  So there was a lot of political things that we had to work on. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1197.36s)]
*  So it was a combination of knocking down political barriers, but also then convincing groups who typically don't do things that they should be doing things. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1200.04s)]
*  And then once we got an anchor in the police departments across the country, the product just started to take off. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1210.6s)]
*  And they realized, OK, well, if police can save lives, anybody could save lives. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1217.72s)]
*  And that was the product just took off. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1222.68s)]
*  You know, we were finding different ways and different avenues just to get as much of this stuff out as we possibly could, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1225.52s)]
*  because we knew that every every 10 units we sold, we were likely going to save at least one life. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1232.24s)]
*  So we were, you know, I told folks the analogy, we were building the car and driving it 100 miles an hour. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1239.88s)]
*  So we were building the company and we were trying to sell as much of this product as we could. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1247.3999999999999s)]
*  It was we did a great job of it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  But I think at the end of the day, when we had discussions with Emergent, they were a much bigger company, much more resources. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1254.32s)]
*  They were well connected in the public space, the public health space with all of the work that they have done with the anthrax vaccination and anthrax. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1263.6799999999998s)]
*  All of their government, public private partnerships really took the product to the next level. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1273.96s)]
*  So when we you know, it was kind of bittersweet to to sell the product because we were doing extremely well. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  But I think the management team at the time realized, OK, well, we're never going to get it to where they can get it. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1289.64s)]
*  And, you know, sure, we sold it for a decent product. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1296.0s)]
*  But I think, you know, everybody was happy that, you know, when we when we left it in their hands and most of my team stayed there when we left in their hands, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1299.88s)]
*  my team combined with their team and they took it, they actually almost doubled it from where we got it. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1310.5600000000002s)]
*  And it's it's saved many, many lives today. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1315.96s)]
*  So it was a phenomenal turning point in my career. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1319.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, obviously, it's a product like Narcan and the path that that last mile to the patient, if you will, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1322.3999999999999s)]
*  much different scenario than any you're going to see in biologists or most most small molecules, obviously. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  Yet the. We've had plenty of conversations on this podcast around like, OK, we have a drug that made it through phase three, the FDA approved it. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1340.3999999999999s)]
*  We're celebrating the champagne bottles are popping and then 18 months down the road, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1352.0s)]
*  that product's no longer on the market because the execution of its commercial availability and use just completely falls flat on its face for myriad reasons. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1358.68s)]
*  Right. It fails. In this case, you had to develop a plan that was unlike any plan that probably had ever been executed in terms of that last mile to the patient. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1368.48s)]
*  You did it. And as I said, recognizing that that's you know, there probably isn't a very clean parallel to biologics or the products that you're working on now. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1379.56s)]
*  I'm curious about how that that win and that fortitude and that problem solving that you exercised during the Narcan rollout. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1389.16s)]
*  How does that translate to your commercial perspective now? [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1400.24s)]
*  Like, you know, you're working obviously with different players, you know, you're not working through municipalities and police departments and trying to get people to, you know, add this to your tool belt while you're on the beat. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1404.44s)]
*  But but the lessons right and the and the like I said, fortitude that it took. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1415.4s)]
*  Do you do you find that it translates or is this like, well, that happened and it's completely removed from from what I'm doing today? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1421.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. And it absolutely translates. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1429.48s)]
*  I think the biggest translating factor that we are doing here that we are that we did there is the people. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1434.04s)]
*  Nothing in the pharmaceutical industry is traditional anymore. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1445.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, in my mind, you know, there's no four thousand sales reps on the street selling feature benefit incentive. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1449.28s)]
*  Right. It's it's that the commercial world is turned on its head. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  The payer world has been, you know, very, very strong. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1462.3999999999999s)]
*  So it really boils down to the team that you hire in order to execute and deliver. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1468.36s)]
*  And that team isn't just your commercial team. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  That team is your clinical team, your development team, your regulatory team, your CMC team, your tech ops team. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1476.12s)]
*  So those learnings at I mean, the common thread throughout my career is just I've been extremely fortunate to work with really smart people and bring smart people into organizations. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1483.12s)]
*  Because and not just smart, intelligent, smart, but smart, motivated, smart. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1497.9599999999998s)]
*  I mean, like. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1503.28s)]
*  Give you an example, Narcan, right? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1505.04s)]
*  We had a guy who was head of marketing and I said to him, listen, I know you want to be head of marketing, but PR is much more powerful than marketing here. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1507.1599999999999s)]
*  And I had to kind of teach him that. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1520.76s)]
*  Probably more powerful and with a product like that necessary. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1522.12s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1526.24s)]
*  And so rather his mindset was, well, he wanted to run marketing. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1527.36s)]
*  I'm like, well, why don't you focus on running PR? [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1531.64s)]
*  Like that is like and he he changed his thinking. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1535.3200000000002s)]
*  Right. And so he applied his skill set, but it was just a different approach. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1540.0s)]
*  The same the same goes for trading distribution. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1545.64s)]
*  Our head of trading distribution was a traditionalist. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1548.88s)]
*  Right. He sold traditional products for GSK and other companies through third party logistics companies. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1552.0400000000002s)]
*  And but if he didn't have the ability to think differently about how to distribute product directly to a department of health and set up a network that people could sign into a website and order it. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1558.76s)]
*  And we would ship it locally and bill centrally and have master prescriptions written. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1572.68s)]
*  I mean, he developed that he learned that it wasn't a cookie cutter. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1578.48s)]
*  We couldn't find that role. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1583.76s)]
*  So those skills, I think, translate into any other job that we have. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1585.36s)]
*  And that's what I'm bringing, I believe, to nerve gen. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1590.12s)]
*  You know, this is we're going to treat spinal cord injury. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1593.16s)]
*  No one's really ever succeeded here. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1596.48s)]
*  There's new paths that we have to pave. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1599.16s)]
*  And if we don't have smart people, they but people who could think differently about how to create a path, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1603.08s)]
*  we're just going to be a traditional pharmaceutical company. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1613.0s)]
*  And that's that you can't be that if you're 12 people working virtually across the United States. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  And so that's what's translatable. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1625.0s)]
*  Translatable is pulling a group of people together that are extremely smart, that can actually be motivated enough and generalists. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1627.28s)]
*  I call them generalists to be able to work without a net and to make decisions and to fail and to succeed and to fail again and succeed. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1635.52s)]
*  You know, it's that type of mindset in every department that we have. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1644.96s)]
*  Finance, you know, give an example, our CFO is he's a great guy. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1649.8000000000002s)]
*  He's he's a he's worked in both Canada and the US. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1656.16s)]
*  Not a lot of CFOs have. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1660.16s)]
*  We are a public company in Canada. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1662.24s)]
*  We're 75 percent held by retail. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1663.88s)]
*  You know, that's not typical. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1667.0s)]
*  You know, typical biotech path is you have four institutional investors that are carrying you all the way. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1669.2800000000002s)]
*  We're not there yet. We may get there. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1675.1200000000001s)]
*  We may never get there if. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1676.88s)]
*  But to be 70 percent retail, 80 percent retail at this stage of our life, you need a CFO who's going to think differently than a traditional, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1679.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, somebody who's going to go to the top 15 institutions in the US. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1688.44s)]
*  You know, we have to go into the high net worth groups. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1693.28s)]
*  We have to go into retail. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1695.2s)]
*  We have to straddle the fence. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1696.3999999999999s)]
*  But that's just one example of. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1698.44s)]
*  The types of people we are bringing into this organization and have at this organization are, [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1702.32s)]
*  you know, chief medical officers the same way he came from a large company and now he's working. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1706.68s)]
*  It's him and one other person in our clinical department. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1711.12s)]
*  You know, he's came from Amgen. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1714.24s)]
*  You know, not many people can do that, you know, could could oversee. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1716.48s)]
*  You know, it's great to have the title chief medical officer, but now he's running clinical operations. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1721.08s)]
*  He's overseeing data management. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1726.3999999999999s)]
*  You know, he's doing things that typical chief medical officers don't do. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1728.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what I mean. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1731.36s)]
*  It's it's it's really the people on the team that you put behind things that are consistently successful. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1733.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, the breadth of his responsibilities is probably considerably more than that than it was at Amgen. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1739.36s)]
*  I'm sure he did great work there, too, but probably a lot more. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1745.08s)]
*  Brilliant, brilliant mind that is, you know, that is now doing different things in his career that [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1747.92s)]
*  I don't think he probably ever expected he'd be doing. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1752.88s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1755.68s)]
*  And I've got some questions for you on people that we're going to get to here in just a minute. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1756.88s)]
*  You know, some some more of the nerve gen roster. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1762.0800000000002s)]
*  But before we go there, I want to talk about peptides for a minute. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1766.3200000000002s)]
*  Like, I want to spend some time talking about that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1769.28s)]
*  It's it's kind of funny, like, you know, I was looking at you guys thinking, you know, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1771.04s)]
*  it does this fit? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1775.9199999999998s)]
*  Does this fit for the Business of Biotech podcast? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1777.1999999999998s)]
*  And I recall the conversation I had with with the VP of of content, effectively my boss here. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1779.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't know, like a year ago. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  And he was like, so for context, the Business of Biotech and Bioprocess online is we focus on [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1789.52s)]
*  biologics, like we focus on large molecule therapeutics, development and manufacture of [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1797.1999999999998s)]
*  large molecule therapeutics. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1802.0s)]
*  And he came to me and he was like, you know, hair on fire. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1804.08s)]
*  He's like, GLP is GLP is because, you know, like any publication, any publishing industry, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1806.1599999999999s)]
*  like we want to latch on to something that's, you know, going to get clicks, right, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1811.76s)]
*  going to going to get eyeballs and sure GLP is we're at. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1815.52s)]
*  And I was like, yeah, man, I don't know. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1818.6399999999999s)]
*  You know, like, I don't I don't think they fit. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1821.1999999999998s)]
*  I don't think these peptides are are fit with like, if we're going to stay true to our large [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1823.6s)]
*  molecule existence, I don't think they fit. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1828.56s)]
*  And it's ironic because I'm the first guy to break the rules, like I'll color outside the [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1832.0s)]
*  lines any chance I get. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1836.9599999999998s)]
*  And as time has kind of carried on here, like I said, I mean, sometimes the FDA treats them [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1839.28s)]
*  like a biologic, sometimes, you know, depending on the how big the chain of amino acids is, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1844.7199999999998s)]
*  you know, whatever criteria they apply sometimes. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1850.3999999999999s)]
*  So I'm like, all right, you know, let's let's let's go ahead and spend more time learning [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1852.7199999999998s)]
*  about and covering peptide therapeutics potentially as as biologics, right? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1857.68s)]
*  Like, sure. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1864.3200000000002s)]
*  They're biotechs that are building them. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1865.1200000000001s)]
*  Let's just do it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1867.04s)]
*  So give me your take. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1868.48s)]
*  Like, and I've got, you know, we could we could probably go long on this. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1869.3600000000001s)]
*  Your take on starting with your perspective on taking the job at nerve gen, right? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1874.64s)]
*  Like, was this something that you're like, well, you know, was it the was it the indication [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1879.92s)]
*  opportunity? [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1884.96s)]
*  Was it the the therapeutic where you're like, you know, these peptides are kind of catching [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1886.0s)]
*  on. It's a cool modality. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1890.0s)]
*  Like, what led you into this into this role? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1891.76s)]
*  And since you've been in the role, give me your take on sort of the peptide. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1894.48s)]
*  I don't want to call it a revolution. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1900.0s)]
*  I mean, like I said, you know, a few approvals a year, it's still sort of nascent, but there's [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1901.44s)]
*  a lot of excitement around around peptides. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1905.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1908.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1909.04s)]
*  To be fully transparent when I was looking at this opportunity, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1910.0s)]
*  I looked at the peptide and I said, wow, this is going to be challenging [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1913.52s)]
*  because peptides are challenging. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1918.16s)]
*  They're not easy. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1919.92s)]
*  You know, they're not easy to manufacture consistently. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1920.72s)]
*  They're not easy to purify. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1923.6s)]
*  You know, there's only a handful of manufacturers in the world who can do it well. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1925.92s)]
*  And I have no experience in peptide manufacturing. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1931.84s)]
*  So that was to me, one of the one of the things I said, OK, well, I look at companies of our size [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1934.48s)]
*  and I look at where they fail and where they fall down. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1943.12s)]
*  And a lot of them fall down in manufacturing. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1946.2399999999998s)]
*  You know, a lot of complete response letters over the last several years. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1948.9599999999998s)]
*  You know, they they do everything perfect clinically, but they either [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1952.56s)]
*  can't make the stuff consistently or they can't or if they do and they get approval, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1956.9599999999998s)]
*  they just fail on the launch site. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1960.9599999999998s)]
*  So I got over that by talking to some colleagues that I've worked with in the past [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1964.56s)]
*  who know peptides, know how to manufacture peptides. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1972.24s)]
*  And it's it's not rocket science, but you have to have the right people [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1976.9599999999998s)]
*  and the right partners to be able to do it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1981.1999999999998s)]
*  So, you know, I do MVG 291 as a handful of amino acids behind becoming labeled a biologic. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1984.3999999999999s)]
*  And biologics are just as challenging, you know, the formulation development. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1994.7199999999998s)]
*  You know, and so I'm actually learning a lot. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=1998.96s)]
*  And one of the gentlemen that came into our organization, Chuck Olson, he's teaching me. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2001.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, he's our head of tech ops and, you know, he's forgotten more about [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2007.76s)]
*  peptides and biologics and manufacturing than I'll ever know in my entire life. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2013.04s)]
*  And that, you know, I have to trust that, you know, he knows what he's doing. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2019.04s)]
*  I mean, I'm a pretty good verifier if somebody is BS in me. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2023.2s)]
*  But, you know, Chuck is the one who's going to get this product manufacturing, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2028.48s)]
*  manufactured and quality controlled and approved by the FDA that we can consistently make it [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2033.84s)]
*  over time. So is it an in vogue space? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2041.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think you mentioned earlier it's in vogue because of a lot of [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2045.84s)]
*  what Lily and Nova Nordis are doing right now. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2051.52s)]
*  Right. But that's cyclical. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2054.08s)]
*  I think it's, you know, and I think it's in vogue because of everything that they're doing, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2057.44s)]
*  but they have the know-how. They know how to work in this space. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2062.88s)]
*  Not a lot of folks do. You know, if they are small molecule companies, they're going to have to [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2067.36s)]
*  bolt on the expertise of managing and working in the peptide space because, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2072.24s)]
*  you know, manufacturing is not a simple process. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2078.96s)]
*  And there's a handful of people, like I said, there's a handful of people that can do it. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2081.68s)]
*  You can tweak a small manufacturing process and have a massive impact on [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2085.7599999999998s)]
*  your yields or your effectiveness or your toxicity. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2090.3999999999996s)]
*  So your decision making then really has to be very, very fine tuned and you make decisions [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2095.3599999999997s)]
*  and stick with them, you know, because once you're too far down the path, if you're sure [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2104.16s)]
*  you could always improve upon something, but you may tweak something that [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2108.32s)]
*  sends you all the way back to preclinical. So it's an art and a science mixed when you're [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2112.48s)]
*  in the peptide space. Yeah. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2119.28s)]
*  I'm going to ask you some more questions about the work Chuck is doing here in a minute. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2121.28s)]
*  But now I want to take the conversation around peptides more narrowly into neuro now. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2125.6000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, you talk about it was, I was unaware of the fact that Narcan was a, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2133.92s)]
*  a meet, you know, a me too player or a hat, you know, and also ran before it became [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2139.44s)]
*  the crown jewel. Right. Like that, that was news to me. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2144.8s)]
*  Well, it was, it was, it was second. It was new. It was always new and novel. The delivery was [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2148.96s)]
*  always new and novel, but it was just another player who had a, had a similar type of delivery. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2152.88s)]
*  But they picked the wrong dose and their clinical trials didn't work out as well. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2161.2s)]
*  So that's why they got the complete response letter. But so I did, I just wanted to make [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2167.12s)]
*  sure it wasn't, it wasn't that they were, you know, we were very different from them. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2170.3199999999997s)]
*  We were very close to them. It's just that we jumped and leapt ahead of them. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2175.2s)]
*  Yeah. So maybe it's not a, not a great segway or analogy then, because I was going to say like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2178.9599999999996s)]
*  in a situation like you're in now, where you're going after these, these neurodiseases, spinal [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2184.4799999999996s)]
*  cord injury being, being a lead, but then, you know, ALS and Alzheimer's and others on the [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2188.4s)]
*  heels of that. These are indications that have multiple modalities chasing them. You know, we see, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2194.7200000000003s)]
*  we see antibodies, we see the cell and gene therapy space running after this, you know, we see, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2202.48s)]
*  you know, all sorts of, you know, human tissue approaches. I mean, there's a, you know, [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2209.92s)]
*  there's any, any number of ways to skin that cat. I don't know if you can still say skin that cat, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2216.4s)]
*  but I just said it. So where do you see, where do you see, where, where do you see peptides kind of [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  fitting into that landscape and in terms of neuro and why, like why, why are peptides a compelling [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2227.92s)]
*  modality to chase down these indications? Yeah. I mean, it's, I think NVG 291 is novel in that [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2236.08s)]
*  it's not like a lock and key, right? It's not like, you know, you have a, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2246.96s)]
*  a receptor that you're trying to attach to and block other things from attaching to it. Right. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2252.08s)]
*  That's how initially it was discovered, right? They discovered that there was this group of [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2260.1600000000003s)]
*  molecules, CSPGs that were inhibiting repair. You know, they're ubiquitous throughout the body. They, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2264.4s)]
*  they are kind of like the cement that holds things together in your spinal cord injury. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2271.28s)]
*  But then when activated due to an injury, they work extremely well at holding things together, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2275.2s)]
*  but they prevent axonal regeneration. So I think early Jerry Silver's work early on is really what [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2281.6s)]
*  started this company. Harold Poonet, who's the founder, his daughter-in-law had a tragedy. She [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2291.12s)]
*  fell, she got paralyzed and he started to scour the earth for anything that would help his daughter-in-law [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2297.6s)]
*  and he came across Jerry's nature paper and said, wow, this is, I don't think he was thinking, [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2304.8s)]
*  oh, this is a peptide at the time. You know, he was thinking, this is showing some phenomenal [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2311.28s)]
*  results in animal models. And he had discussions with Jerry and he ultimately found a group of [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2316.0s)]
*  investors in Vancouver to in license technology and nerve gen was formed. So I think sometimes, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2321.52s)]
*  um, you know, I'm trying to give an analogy. I'm coming up with, I'm coming blank, but [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2329.6800000000003s)]
*  sometimes the therapeutic will define the space rather than the space defining the therapeutic. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2338.0s)]
*  And then through our work with NVG 291, Matthew Lukachev, who's our head of preclinical development [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2345.44s)]
*  and has identified other different ways, which are similar, you know, similar ways [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2352.0s)]
*  has discovered, uh, NVG 300. Uh, and now we're testing that and that has actually, you know, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2357.52s)]
*  could potentially qualify as a biologic. So even though we're a peptide with NVG 291, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2365.36s)]
*  our next product could potentially be a biologic. Um, so we're not necessarily wedded to being [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2370.64s)]
*  the peptide company. Um, what we're doing is we're trying to take what NVG 291 has demonstrated [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2377.12s)]
*  preclinically and we're trying to see if it can be translated into humans because, uh, it, it [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2383.28s)]
*  basically, um, and we're learning a lot that we're learning a ton and we're doing a lot more work [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2389.84s)]
*  on NVG 291. You know, we're trying to get down to, well, what is the exact molecular mechanism? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2395.36s)]
*  We know what happens when you, when you put it into the situation, right? We know that it [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2401.92s)]
*  turns CSPGs off, you get axonal regeneration, you get remyelination of damaged axons and you [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2406.48s)]
*  enhance plasticity, um, near and far from the injury. So what we don't know is, well, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2412.0s)]
*  molecularly, how is it doing that? And that's what we're doing now. We're doing a lot of work [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2418.64s)]
*  to understand it. Now, you know, we hope to have all of that work in a nice package with a bell on [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2423.44s)]
*  it to sit down with the FDA, but look at all the package inserts of all the products that are out [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2429.04s)]
*  there that are approved at the first line in the, in the mechanism of action. Say, you know, we, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2434.08s)]
*  the actual mechanism is not known, however, and then all of the data, you know, goes. So that's [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2438.64s)]
*  right now, if the package insert were printed, we'd be a peptide. Uh, we don't, we would say, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2443.8399999999997s)]
*  we don't know the specific molecular mechanism, however, and then it would be all the data that [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  we do see. So, um, I know I'm kind of skirting your question around on peptides, but I think, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2454.56s)]
*  you know, we're wedded to peptides because we're wedded to NVG 291. Yeah. Uh, NVG 300 works and [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2461.7599999999998s)]
*  translates. We'll be wedded to biologics. Yeah. Um, so we're opportunistic in that, you know, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2468.0s)]
*  finding products that will solve problems for diseases that are, you know, the uniqueness, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2474.4s)]
*  the way NVG 291 works is different than how other people are targeting the disease. You know, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2480.88s)]
*  they're targeting, um, they're trying to get nerves to grow. They're trying to get, um, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2486.48s)]
*  things to fight through the glial scar. Uh, what we're doing is we're just shutting off [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2493.04s)]
*  something that is in the body that is stopping things from repairing itself. Yeah. Uh, so we'll [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2497.6s)]
*  see if it works and we'll, you know, I think we're going to be synergistic with, especially in spinal [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2504.48s)]
*  cord injury. I think it's going to be two or three different products mechanistically that will [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2509.52s)]
*  give folks gains. And, and it's really, as you dig into spinal cord injury, um, you realize that [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2515.8399999999997s)]
*  it's going to be as much pressure is going to be put on the drug to produce as the patient to [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2524.24s)]
*  produce, because we can actually, if we can regenerate, right, if we can remake connections [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2528.16s)]
*  and remyelinate, that's one step one. Um, the patient is actually going to have to turn those [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2533.92s)]
*  muscles that those nerves are talking to into motion and action and function. So that's why, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2540.16s)]
*  you know, we're doing this study at Shirley Ryan and we're doing it in a rehab facility and we're [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2547.04s)]
*  combining all of those modalities together. Yeah. Yeah. Very cool. I want to, I want to talk, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2551.44s)]
*  like I said, I want to get back to the work that Chuck is doing and I want to kind of frame it up [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2557.12s)]
*  like this. Like it's interesting, uh, you know, you got a guy like you, Mike Kelly, he's, he's seen a [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2560.96s)]
*  whole bunch of products through to commercialization. He's, he's experienced those wins. He's well [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2566.08s)]
*  experienced at putting products on the market and seeing them through. And then he joins nerve gen [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2571.84s)]
*  and it's like, well, you know, at the surface level, he just took a giant step backward because, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2576.96s)]
*  you know, what, you know, one, one B two ways cool and everything, but it's still quite a ways from [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2581.6800000000003s)]
*  the commercial side of things. Um, so on one hand, you're like, wow, that's a, that's a giant step [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2585.6s)]
*  backward. Like if, if Mike sticks around there for a few years, he's, he, you know, he's, he's unlikely, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2590.08s)]
*  at least in the short term to feel that again. Right. But on the other hand, I'm like, I don't [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2596.0s)]
*  know why I'm thinking, I don't know why you, you wouldn't want someone in the CEO's chair who has [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2602.08s)]
*  taken through things through development all the way to commercialization at this early stage, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2608.24s)]
*  because the work that Chuck Olson is doing in tech ops and CMC, he's making decisions, you know, he [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2612.96s)]
*  and others, I'm sure are making decisions that are either going to seal, you know, they're going to [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2618.96s)]
*  seal the fate one way or the other, right? They're, they have major implications on how quickly you [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2625.12s)]
*  move through the clinic and how, to your point, manufacturable these difficult to work with [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2629.28s)]
*  peptides are, um, and all sorts of regulatory implications. Um, so I'm using a lot of words [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2635.1200000000003s)]
*  here to get back to Chuck Olson and the work he's doing. And I'd like you to share with us, uh, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2642.32s)]
*  about, you know, some of the details around the work he's doing that, that you look at and you go, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2647.6800000000003s)]
*  yeah, you know, like we're still developing, we're still figuring out manufacturability, [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2652.88s)]
*  but the decisions he's making are going to pay dividends when we're in phase three and beyond. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2658.08s)]
*  Yeah. So it gets back to the, uh, the people component that I talked about earlier. Um, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2664.7999999999997s)]
*  and we just actually, it's funny because I was on with a group yesterday and we were talking about, [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2671.92s)]
*  you know, bringing another person of talent into the organization. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2676.4s)]
*  And everybody has their opinion on what that person should be doing and saying, and, you know, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2681.2799999999997s)]
*  their experience and how long they should be around, you know, whether they should be a PhD [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2685.92s)]
*  or this or that and all nine yards. And, you know, I think it's important to get coalesce around [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2690.0s)]
*  experience is one thing, but working in this environment in a startup could, you know, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2696.88s)]
*  I've seen people who are phenomenal, phenomenally experienced at Merck, I've hired them and I put [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2704.56s)]
*  them in this environment and they vapor lock. And what I mean by vapor lock is like the, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2711.6s)]
*  they don't have a, an assistant. They don't have, uh, they have to call, they have to actually [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2717.84s)]
*  figure out how to work their computer. You know, there may not get a computer for the first couple [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2723.36s)]
*  of days. You know, when they do get a computer, they have to learn how to do our filing system [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2727.84s)]
*  online. You know, they have to make their own travel arrangements. They have to run their own [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2731.52s)]
*  schedule. They have to call their own meetings. You know, it's, so it, you know, we have outsourced [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2735.52s)]
*  HR. So if they have an issue, they have to, you know, it's just not the right environment for [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2742.24s)]
*  everybody. A lot of folks like all of that stuff taken care of. And then they can operate in this [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2747.36s)]
*  environment. You have to go with the flow and operate and take care of it. But with that, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2755.12s)]
*  you get to make bigger decisions than you've ever made before in your career. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2761.6s)]
*  And that's what fuels people. Um, and so I look for people who could live in this environment, [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2765.6800000000003s)]
*  thrive in this environment. Um, and I'm very, I'm a very big fan of, uh, test driving, you know, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2770.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, because they're testing us, we're testing them. So Chuck is perfect example. Chuck [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  joined us as a consultant. Yeah. He had his own consulting company. Uh, he started working five [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2782.48s)]
*  hours a week and 10. And then Chuck started working like 30 to 40 hours a week and not billing us. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2789.36s)]
*  And I'm like, Hey Chuck, do you want to join the company? And I know you're going to be putting [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2795.92s)]
*  your company on hold. Um, but we really could use you on the leadership team of this company. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2799.6000000000004s)]
*  And he joined the company. So that to me is, you know, he's doing more than just CMC and tech ops. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2806.5600000000004s)]
*  He's a generalist. He's running a big portion of this business. He's empowered by that. He's making [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2813.6s)]
*  big decisions. Uh, when he's challenged with, you know, if it's a huge decision, he brings it to the [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2819.6s)]
*  management team and we meet once a week and he says, okay, here's, here's what I'm thinking. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2825.92s)]
*  Here's a decision I'm making here. The alternatives, anybody agree, disagree. Um, and people [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2831.28s)]
*  challenge him. People say, well, did you think about this? Do you think about this? Do you think [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2837.68s)]
*  about this? Well, what about this? Yeah, I guess so just to kind of summarize the discussion around [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2840.64s)]
*  Chuck, which is the same discussion around everyone who's running a function in my group, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2847.8399999999997s)]
*  on my team is, um, they have to be a generalist. They have to be a strategic thinker. They have to [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2852.48s)]
*  have good judgment, um, because they're making judgment calls every day. Um, and you know, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2858.7999999999997s)]
*  we can't have this hierarchical approval of things, you know, we wouldn't get anything done. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2865.2s)]
*  So then they have to be, they can't be afraid of making a decision and moving on. And, you know, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2870.3199999999997s)]
*  if it's a major decision, they also have to have the sound judgment to know that this is a major [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2876.3999999999996s)]
*  decision that's going to have knock-in effects to the business. So I'm going to bring it to the team [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2881.4399999999996s)]
*  and just vet my decision here. So that's, that's the process. It's, uh, and then, you know, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2886.16s)]
*  you go away and execute. So it's not like we're spending weeks on trying to figure something out. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2892.56s)]
*  You bring it to the team, you make a decision, you move on. Yeah. Does Chuck also, uh, bear [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2897.2s)]
*  the bulk of the responsibility for your relationship with outsourced manufacturers? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2903.6s)]
*  He does. Yeah. Yeah. Chuck and a woman named Judy, um, both, you know, they're our CMC department. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2907.68s)]
*  They, they, uh, managed our relationships with, uh, drug substance. They're looking right now at [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2916.08s)]
*  our supply chain for drug supply. Um, you know, and tech transfers and tech ops and enhanced [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2923.68s)]
*  changes and formulations and everything. So those two manage all, everything having to do with, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2932.3199999999997s)]
*  um, manufacturing CMC. Um, Chuck also oversees regulatory. Um, so we don't have a regulatory [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2938.64s)]
*  person in-house. We will ultimately be bringing somebody in-house, but at this stage of the company, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2947.52s)]
*  we don't, you know, we, we need experts and to hire the experts who would cost way too much money. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2952.16s)]
*  So, and they would be bored because we have one program. So we hire experts and they report into, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2958.0s)]
*  you know, Chuck and me and Dan, uh, when we're, when we need advice on what to do and what to say [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2965.8399999999997s)]
*  and how to approach the FDA. Yeah. It's, it's, it's an interesting point around personnel decisions [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2972.24s)]
*  and who you bring on full time. I mean, great example in Chuck and that, you know, you said, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2977.2s)]
*  Hey, this consultant that we're using, uh, we could use him full time and then some right now. So it's [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2981.04s)]
*  a timely time to bring them in. Um, I've found in my discussions with biotech leaders that there [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2985.6s)]
*  doesn't necessarily appear to be like a super formulaic approach to, you know, when you bring [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2990.08s)]
*  in a CMO or a chief regulatory officer or a chief commercial officer, you know, the general response [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=2995.36s)]
*  I get is like, well, you know, the sooner the better, but they don't all, you know, not everyone [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3002.0s)]
*  follows the same playbook. So I, I guess two-part question on that. What is your sort of general [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3006.72s)]
*  approach to like spacing out sort of gating the hiring of these positions and, and, and, and, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3012.72s)]
*  and like, why, what's sort of the strategy behind when you bring these people on board? [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3020.08s)]
*  Cause if you do it at the wrong time, I mean, you're, you're either wasting money early to your [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3026.64s)]
*  point, like you'd be wasting money on a chief regulatory officer right now. You bring them in [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3030.3999999999996s)]
*  too late, you know, you could create some problems there too. That's right. That's right. And I, I [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3034.3199999999997s)]
*  think small companies like ours typically tend to err on the too late side of things, [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3039.2s)]
*  mainly because of cash, right? But, you know, I think the way I, the way I make decisions, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3045.4399999999996s)]
*  and I think the way most of my team makes decisions on bringing people in is, you know, [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3054.7999999999997s)]
*  I'll give you an example. Our head of preclinical right now is working on [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3061.68s)]
*  NVG 300 and advancing that, but also working on all the preclinical package for NVG 291. And we [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3065.2799999999997s)]
*  raised, we weren't doing a ton of work on NVG 300. We raised some capital, we had some cash, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3073.2s)]
*  we gave it to him. So now he's got 15 to 20 projects going. He's working 50 hours a week. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3077.7599999999998s)]
*  He's not taking a vacation in a year. It's like, hey, it's time that you bring some help on here, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3084.0s)]
*  you know, because he is prioritizing. NVG 291 is the lead priority. I said, but now that we told [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3091.12s)]
*  the world we have 300 and we set some expectations externally, now we've got to hit these deadlines. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3096.8s)]
*  So I think it's two things to answer your question directly. Number one, when you see the talent, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3102.32s)]
*  you have to hire them, right? When you, when you find somebody like a Chuck, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3109.28s)]
*  who's working extremely well with the organization, he works seamlessly with the, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3114.3199999999997s)]
*  he works seamlessly with the executive team. He led the group in CMC. So when you find him, [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3120.24s)]
*  you hire him or you try to get him here as quickly as you can. Even if, even if it's only 50% job, [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3131.8399999999997s)]
*  and for him, it was much more than 50%. So my rule of thumb is if there's 75% of a job here [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3138.48s)]
*  and you find somebody, hire them. And if you don't find that person, keep looking until it gets [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3144.32s)]
*  closer, you know, and if you're over a hundred percent, you're in trouble. So you should have [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3152.56s)]
*  already been looking. So we're constantly looking, you know, that's one of the things about [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3156.96s)]
*  executives and startups. They are constantly looking for talent who will live well in this [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3162.56s)]
*  environment and execute. And it's hard to find. So when you find them, either hire them as a [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3168.96s)]
*  consultant to do some work for you, to keep them close to you, or stay in touch with them. And I [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3176.4s)]
*  right now have, well, we just hired a head of program management at the same time we hired Chuck. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3182.8s)]
*  And she was a consultant as well, and she joined us. We currently have a consultant working on [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3189.76s)]
*  corporate and business development, and I've worked with him for 15 years. And as soon as I get enough [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3195.6800000000003s)]
*  cash in the coffers, I'm going to hire him full time. So that's kind of how we operate. And I [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3200.7200000000003s)]
*  think it's A, you've got to identify the talent and then B, you know, you have to time it right so [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3207.6800000000003s)]
*  that they're not sitting on their hands and doing nothing. But if you hire the right startup type [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3213.36s)]
*  person, they'll do anything. They'll do, like I'm giving a perfect example, Liz Eberhardt, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3218.4s)]
*  who's our head of program management. She's dug in and she's the key point person on enrollment [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3226.56s)]
*  in our current clinical trial. That's not her job, but she has the experience and she's mature [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3232.64s)]
*  enough and she's well versed enough in PR, which is essentially what you're doing when you're trying [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3239.6s)]
*  to bring awareness to your trial to oversee an outside source PR firm. So she stepped in, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3246.88s)]
*  she stepped up and she's running it. So that's kind of the model. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3254.32s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Yeah, you bring up an important point, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3257.52s)]
*  just a couple more questions, and then we're going to have to wrap things up and run it short on time. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3260.8s)]
*  But you bring up the point around like, I'm going to hire this guy as soon as I can [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3264.0s)]
*  afford to, right? And companies find themselves, companies like NerveGen, as a matter of fact, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3268.7200000000003s)]
*  I think you do probably find yourself in one of those positions right now where maybe the cash [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3272.96s)]
*  runway management needs to be a little bit more scrupulous because you're running up to a point [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3278.88s)]
*  where soon, perhaps, I don't know, I don't want to make any forward looking statements, but perhaps [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3285.28s)]
*  soon in the next few quarters, you'll have some, your pre-human data right now, we'll put it that [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3293.2s)]
*  way. Scott Gottlieb Yeah, I can tell you, we publicly stated, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3299.36s)]
*  I think our financials were released this morning. We have a couple of years of cash, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3302.56s)]
*  so we have plenty of cash in the coffers. We're targeting complete enrollment in the [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3309.04s)]
*  chronic cohort this quarter, which would give us data in Q1 of next year for that cohort. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3313.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's really going to be the coming out party for this company. Once we have that data, [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3320.0s)]
*  we're working financially to make sure that we're in a position where we can up list onto NASDAQ, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3326.08s)]
*  we can get some institutional investors in, we can fund our phase three. We're actually [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3333.04s)]
*  interviewing people today to help us tee up that phase three. So all of this work is being done. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3337.7599999999998s)]
*  So to answer your question, yeah, we're targeting Q2 for chronic enrollment and targeting Q1 for data. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3343.3599999999997s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Yeah, well, you answered multiple of my questions, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3348.56s)]
*  that's where I was going. You're at this point where you get that data, that's an inflection [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3351.2s)]
*  point that could open some, I don't want to say floodgates, we won't put the cart in front of the [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3356.48s)]
*  horse, but it could certainly open up some funding opportunities. So I was curious about what the [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3359.92s)]
*  funding strategy might look like. Should you get to that point and the data looks real good? You [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3363.8399999999997s)]
*  mentioned that you're largely retail right now. Where would you like to see the company, maybe at [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3370.7999999999997s)]
*  this point next year, right? Like August 2025, in terms of like, where the stuff that's feeding [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3376.48s)]
*  the coffers is coming from? Scott Gottlieb Yeah, let's see, August 25, I would love to be either [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3387.52s)]
*  meeting with the FDA for an end of phase two meeting and or preparing very closely to getting [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3395.12s)]
*  an end of phase two meeting with the FDA. I'd love to be uplisted on NASDAQ with three to five [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3402.8s)]
*  major institutions that are in this space that believe in us and believe in the data that we've [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3409.44s)]
*  just produced in order to help us fund us to commercial. Now, obviously, that it really is [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3416.32s)]
*  dictated upon how big that next study is and how much that next study is going to cost. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3425.92s)]
*  But I really want to be in a position where funding is not an issue for this company anymore [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3430.88s)]
*  and talent acquisition is. That's really the key is so for here this time next year, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3436.56s)]
*  teeing up a phase three program for chronic spinal cord injury. And then hopefully MVG 300 is [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3445.76s)]
*  entering into or in the middle of IND enabling studies, depending on funding. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3453.44s)]
*  I think that's a real company. That's like, you know, and when I not that we're not a real [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3460.16s)]
*  company today, but I mean, that's a real NASDAQ listable company. And I think that [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3464.0s)]
*  has some vision on where we're going and what we're doing and timelines and how to get there. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3469.6s)]
*  Scott Gottlieb Yeah, very good. Well, like I said, we're short on time. So I'm going to let you off [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3473.6s)]
*  the hook for now. I'm going to suggest that we regroup in August 25. Maybe, you know, we could [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3478.88s)]
*  revisit this conversation, say, here's, here's where you said you wanted to be, Mike, one year [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3483.52s)]
*  ago, what's it looking like today? That'd be fun. But I wish you all the luck in the world. It's a [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3488.4s)]
*  fascinating story. You've been very transparent. And, and, and, and I think I think there's a lot [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3493.6800000000003s)]
*  of value sort of in the stories that you've shared with us. So so thanks for coming on. [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3500.56s)]
*  Mike Piller I appreciate it, Matt. Thanks for the opportunity. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtbCEiWqPMQ&t=3504.88s)]
