Video Description: In close partnership with Johns Hopkins and TriLink BioTechnologies, Jeff Coller, Ph.D. and Michelle Kim, Ph.D. have built a sandbox for RNA developers and aspirational RNA business builders to play in. On this week's episode of the Business of Biotech, we team up once again with Advancing RNA's Anna Rose Welch to learn about the venture, dubbed the Johns Hopkins University RNA Innovation Center. Anna Rose and I queried Drs. Coller and Kim on how the Center came to be, what it has to offer, and how early-stage RNA explorers can benefit from the resource.

# RNA Sandbox with Johns Hopkins RNA Innovation Center's Jeff Coller, Ph.D. and Michelle Kim, Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [January 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38)
*  You don't need to be a full-time biotech analyst to get a sense for the burgeoning RNA therapeutics [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=0.0s)]
*  landscape. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=10.52s)]
*  The space has been sprouting new company growth at a dizzying pace, particularly on the heels [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=11.52s)]
*  of the COVID pandemic, and it's showing no signs of slowing down. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=16.04s)]
*  While the development of RNA therapeutics is arguably the brightest spot on the biotech [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=21.2s)]
*  horizon, you might also argue that the public and private research infrastructure required [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=25.72s)]
*  to support the advance of RNA as a therapeutic modality has some catching up to do. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=31.0s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=36.96s)]
*  I'm Anna Rose Walsh. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=37.96s)]
*  And on today's episode of the Business of Biotech, we're going to take a deep dive with [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=39.8s)]
*  a couple of RNA industry notables who are working hard to create a world-class research [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=43.36s)]
*  and development resource for RNA innovators centered around a world-class resource of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  its own right at Johns Hopkins University's Institute for Nanobiotechnology. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=54.339999999999996s)]
*  If you're into RNA, our guests likely need no introduction. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=60.339999999999996s)]
*  Dr. Jeff Coller is a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor of RNA Biology and Therapeutics [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=63.98s)]
*  at Johns Hopkins University, and he serves on the boards of the Society for RNA Therapeutics [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=68.78s)]
*  and the Alliance for mRNA Medicines. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=74.78s)]
*  His colleague, Dr. Michelle Kim, is Managing Director of the new Johns Hopkins RNA Innovation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=77.58s)]
*  Center, the ambitious initiative. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=82.94s)]
*  The duo are spearheading a Hopkins Molecular Biology and Biochem PhD herself. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=85.46s)]
*  Dr. Kim brings more than a decade of research experience earned at Howard Hughes Medical [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=91.7s)]
*  Institute, Circulomics, and PacBio to the party. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=96.62s)]
*  Jeff and Michelle, welcome to the show. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=100.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=102.22s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=103.22s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=104.22s)]
*  Happy to have you. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=105.22s)]
*  Yeah, super happy to have you. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=106.7s)]
*  Yeah, and- [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=108.97999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we're excited to be here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=109.97999999999999s)]
*  We had the benefit of a conversation, what, a few weeks ago with Jeff to talk a little [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=112.98s)]
*  bit about what's going on there, and it's a relatively new initiative that we're excited [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=118.26s)]
*  to share with the audience because I think the work that you guys are doing is going [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=123.38000000000001s)]
*  to be awfully intriguing to the folks who are interested in RNA who are business biotech [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=126.68s)]
*  listeners and I thought- [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=132.86s)]
*  Which could be everyone. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=133.86s)]
*  It could be everyone. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=134.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean- [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=135.86s)]
*  It could be everyone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=136.86s)]
*  Yeah, you might not be an RNA developer, but everybody's RNA curious, right? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=137.86s)]
*  Should be. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=141.38s)]
*  Should be. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=142.38s)]
*  Have RNA all throughout them, so. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=143.38s)]
*  Yeah, everyone has RNA. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=144.38s)]
*  We are mRNA, come on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  That's painting with a pretty broad brush. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=150.54000000000002s)]
*  That should be on a t-shirt, right? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  We'll go with it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=154.54000000000002s)]
*  We'll go with it. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=156.54000000000002s)]
*  I thought maybe we'd start with the origin story of the Johns Hopkins RNA Innovation [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  Center. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=163.5s)]
*  What was the nucleus of thought, the kernel of thought that sprouted this initiative? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=166.38s)]
*  Yeah, it really started back during the pandemic, and so the origin story really goes way back [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=172.3s)]
*  to 2012. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=181.1s)]
*  I first started working on mRNA-based therapeutics back in that time, and the space of mRNA therapeutics [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=184.5s)]
*  was something that most people just weren't paying much attention to. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=193.58s)]
*  I had gone to some of these meetings that were very small at the time, only a couple [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=198.06s)]
*  dozen people, and had met some of the big players in that field, in particular a guy [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=202.34s)]
*  named Mike Houston, who was a CSO of a very small company out of Seattle called Phase [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=208.9s)]
*  RX. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  I was talking with them, and Mike and I had some ideas about how to improve mRNA-based [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=215.10000000000002s)]
*  therapeutics. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=223.02s)]
*  This was more than 10, 15 years ago now. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=224.02s)]
*  And I started working with Phase RX, and sadly they basically went under. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=227.58s)]
*  But during the pandemic, Mike gave me a call, and he was now a CSO of TriLink Biotechnologies, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=232.86s)]
*  which as we all know, loomed into this huge organization during the pandemic because they [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=241.14000000000001s)]
*  were supplying clean cap for Comernity, or Pfizer's version of the vaccine. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=247.1s)]
*  And what was clear in some of the conversations that Mike and I had was there's a lot of interest [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=253.42s)]
*  in the RNA therapeutic space, but there's only a few dozen labs on the planet that are [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=259.46s)]
*  even working on mRNA, mRNA translation, mRNA stability. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=265.82s)]
*  And so how are you going to develop a new therapeutic modality, which has really become [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=270.86s)]
*  a pillar of medicine now, and innovate that if the academic support network just doesn't [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=276.4s)]
*  exist? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=283.04s)]
*  And, you know, one of the great limiting steps, of course, with getting academics interested [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=284.04s)]
*  in this is feasibility and accessibility to materials at a reduced cost and at a cost [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=288.76s)]
*  point where they can do rapid experiments and try to innovate around the iterative experiments [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=295.56s)]
*  that they would do. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=302.24s)]
*  And Mike and I started talking about this, and he put me together with the one of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=304.12s)]
*  founders of Merivai, which is the parent company of TriLink, a guy named Carl Hall. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=309.64s)]
*  And Carl and I had a conversation around this where we thought, wouldn't it be great if [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=315.64s)]
*  we could get into academics' hands at a very reduced cost RNA based molecules that they [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=320.08s)]
*  could then, you know, rapidly screen through, rapidly innovate their technology around. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=328.0s)]
*  And then do experimentations and continue to evolve from that standpoint. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=334.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's essentially what we did is we created this partnership with TriLink in order to [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=343.12s)]
*  make mRNAs at a preclinical grade level so that our investigators could work on it. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=350.56s)]
*  And really, there's sort of two hopes here. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=361.0s)]
*  One is that since we're working with TriLink and we're using their SOPs, that any molecule [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=363.88s)]
*  that gets developed in a laboratory would be easily moved to a GMP type production facility. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=370.56s)]
*  It wouldn't be difficult to move that beyond the preclinical stage. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=379.84s)]
*  But the other side of it, again, is this idea that if we have mRNAs that are at a reduced [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=385.0s)]
*  cost, it allows the investigators to play with it and allows us to, you know, try different [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=391.84s)]
*  structures, try different modifications, try different, you know, arrangements of open [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  reading frames, whatever it is, in order to improve upon whatever disease it is that they're [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=401.88s)]
*  after going after. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=408.28s)]
*  Because, you know, one of the clear ramifications of what's happened in the last five years [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=409.28s)]
*  is that mRNA based approaches work brilliantly for vaccines. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=415.55999999999995s)]
*  To get them to that next step, that promise of, you know, cancer, new antigen therapy [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=420.76000000000005s)]
*  or gene replacement of monogenic disorders, we really have to innovate in ways to go beyond [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=426.0s)]
*  the biology that is naturally limiting to the mRNA expression space. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=431.98s)]
*  So in a nutshell, that's really where we're trying to go and why we formed the center. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=438.36s)]
*  The other aspect of that is, which I think is a very key piece of the RNA Innovation [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=444.8s)]
*  Center, is that we are situated right next to individuals that are world expert in LNP [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=451.04s)]
*  delivery. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=457.56s)]
*  Because it doesn't matter how much you innovate in the mRNA space, if you can't get it to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=458.68s)]
*  the right cells, well, then you're just not going to be able to do anything. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=463.40000000000003s)]
*  So by having our investigators in the INBT, the Institute for Nanobio-Technology, it really [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=468.68s)]
*  allows us to play these two technologies off of each other and then go after, you know, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  hard to solve problems. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=482.24s)]
*  Michelle, how did you end up joining Jeff here at the RNA Innovation Institute? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=484.72s)]
*  I mean, is it... [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=492.2s)]
*  Was it... [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=493.48s)]
*  How did this partnership arise? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=496.04s)]
*  Quite serendipitously. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=498.84s)]
*  I was at PacBio. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=500.28s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=502.24s)]
*  I was at PacBio and I was... [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=503.24s)]
*  Well, I should back up a little bit. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=505.96s)]
*  I was at a startup that rolled out of Hopkins, which was acquired by PacBio. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=508.0s)]
*  So I really love the startup environment. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=511.96s)]
*  And I really love PacBio. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=515.1999999999999s)]
*  It was a great company, but I was searching for something more akin to a startup environment. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=516.1999999999999s)]
*  I reached out to Jeff because I saw that he is active in the startup space and we got [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=521.4s)]
*  to talking and he said, you know, actually I have this other thing that's going on and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=527.72s)]
*  you might be interested in that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=532.28s)]
*  So... [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=533.6800000000001s)]
*  This other thing. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=534.6800000000001s)]
*  When was that, Michelle? [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=538.48s)]
*  I guess that was in the beginning of 24, maybe around January that I reached out to you. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=539.48s)]
*  Yeah, I think it was about January 2024. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  So what did it look like to you, Michelle, when Jeff said, well, I have this thing. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=549.48s)]
*  What was the thing at that point? [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=554.84s)]
*  Was the thing an idea? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=556.72s)]
*  Were there bricks and mortar behind it? [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=559.04s)]
*  Was there... [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=560.44s)]
*  Oh no, I think... [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=561.44s)]
*  Sorry, yeah. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=562.44s)]
*  No, I think it was pretty clear even at that point that it was going to be the RNA Innovation [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=563.44s)]
*  Center and what the goal was and what the drive was and the vision for how it would [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=567.84s)]
*  grow and what it would become in the future. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=572.52s)]
*  I think that was already in place. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=574.76s)]
*  So I was very excited because I was trained in grad school as an RNA biologist and going [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=577.16s)]
*  into my postdoc, I took RNA into a translational research space. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=584.6s)]
*  And then when I went to the startup, I took a step away. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=590.0s)]
*  So I always wanted to come back. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=592.72s)]
*  So this just seemed like an amazing segue to go back to the place I wanted to be. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=594.32s)]
*  Yeah, very serendipitous. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=598.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=601.44s)]
*  What was your charge, Michelle? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=602.52s)]
*  What did Jeff say? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=606.04s)]
*  All right, we're going to do this thing and I want you to be on board. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=607.04s)]
*  Here's what I'd like you to do. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=610.6800000000001s)]
*  Do you get to make it up as you go along? [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=613.3199999999999s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=615.3199999999999s)]
*  Michelle, what are you doing? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  What do you do, Michelle? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=617.3199999999999s)]
*  Jeff's listening with very piqued interest now. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=621.3199999999999s)]
*  What are you doing, Michelle? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm going to start taking notes here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  What did I hire and what has she been doing? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=628.3199999999999s)]
*  I like to think of our arrangement and Jeff, you should correct me if I'm off target. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=631.3199999999999s)]
*  Jeff is like the CEO and the CSO and I'm like the COO. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=636.3199999999999s)]
*  Our visions are aligned on what we want to do here and I try to make it happen in the [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=641.24s)]
*  broadest sense. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=649.24s)]
*  That's how I describe it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=650.24s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=653.24s)]
*  What would you consider the mission of the center at this point? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=654.24s)]
*  You've got the Tri-Link Association, you've got the infrastructure in place to pull things [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=658.24s)]
*  together. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=662.72s)]
*  We'll talk more specifically about funding here in a minute. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=663.72s)]
*  As you formed up, Jeff, how would you sort of crystallize the mission of the center now? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=668.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the mission really is to try again in an academic, you know, it's really [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=672.16s)]
*  sort of a quasi-academic industrial relationship and I think that's a very critical piece, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=677.4s)]
*  especially when you have a technology that really is in its infancy where you're trying [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=683.32s)]
*  to move it into these new areas. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=688.28s)]
*  And so its mission is to do just that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=690.8s)]
*  It's to take on challenging problems and work with investigators who have expertise in, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=694.2s)]
*  you know, whether it's cancer biology or some sort of monogenic disorder, to work with them [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=699.44s)]
*  to try and solve a problem. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=704.9200000000001s)]
*  So having, you know, experts in RNA biology, experts in manufacturing and then experts [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=707.6600000000001s)]
*  in delivery and of course experts associated with whatever education to put those pieces [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=712.6600000000001s)]
*  together in a way that is beneficial and can go through experimental reiteration so that [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=718.88s)]
*  we can learn from each other and then gather that information and then hopefully make inroads [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=726.64s)]
*  into this technology. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=732.28s)]
*  And I really think this sort of model is the only place this is going to really occur because [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=733.28s)]
*  by the time something gets spun out at the biotech level, they're already set on their [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=738.92s)]
*  way, right? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=743.3199999999999s)]
*  They have whatever product it is that they're thinking about, their indication, they're [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=744.3199999999999s)]
*  going down there. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=747.4799999999999s)]
*  There's not much time to go through experimental iterations. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=749.3199999999999s)]
*  And in the academic setting, in a pure academic setting, there's not necessarily the roadmap [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=752.8s)]
*  in how to commercialize and go after therapeutic development. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=761.92s)]
*  It's really this, you know, it's always been known as this valley of death between academics [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=765.88s)]
*  and industry. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=770.7199999999999s)]
*  And I think what our center does is sort of fill that void in a unique fashion. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=772.52s)]
*  Our mission is really that, to put into the hands of our investigators the power to be [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=777.52s)]
*  able to try different therapeutic applications and test them and then hopefully spin those [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=783.48s)]
*  out either to market them to other partners or to make their own companies associated [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=789.8s)]
*  with Johns Hopkins. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=796.88s)]
*  And a long-term aspirational vision that we have is to make our own, to start from ground [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=799.88s)]
*  zero, some sort of therapeutic and take it all the way to a clinical trial at Johns Hopkins [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=806.24s)]
*  and have this sort of wholly owned program that we've developed. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=812.0s)]
*  And hopefully that would take advantage of some of the novel science that we intend to [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=814.8s)]
*  explore. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=821.32s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to add to that too. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=822.32s)]
*  I mean, Hopkins has a very rich history of taking research from basic science to a therapeutic. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=825.16s)]
*  And so we would like to be a part of that narrative. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=831.08s)]
*  And we're hoping to bridge the place where people are at the point of discovery, which [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=833.4s)]
*  as Jeff said is more challenging to do if you're in a biotech or pharma setting. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=838.12s)]
*  So we can meet people where they're exploring things, exploring ideas and help them get [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=843.4s)]
*  to the point where they're ready to try something larger in a clinical trial. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=847.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=853.12s)]
*  It begs the question. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=854.12s)]
*  I'll let you, I know you, I know you, Ellen, but it begs the question just for a level [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=855.12s)]
*  set of understanding. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=859.3199999999999s)]
*  We talked about these people, these discoverers, these investigators. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=860.32s)]
*  Who are these people? [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=865.1600000000001s)]
*  Who's invited to come play at the RNA Innovation Center? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=866.72s)]
*  All are welcome. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  I mean, right now we've started out pretty small, meaning mainly Hopkins researchers, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=871.8000000000001s)]
*  but that's not really small. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=880.48s)]
*  I mean, we're a pretty big institution. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=881.7600000000001s)]
*  Once we get our sort of the wind beneath our wings will expand from that. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=887.2s)]
*  But as you know, as Michelle said, all are welcome. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=893.0s)]
*  He seemed a little anxious. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=898.16s)]
*  He was looking at us in a strange way. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=900.12s)]
*  He's recognizing the power of this platform and he realizes that when this episode drops, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=906.12s)]
*  the floodgates will likely open. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=910.76s)]
*  To be honest with you, the reason I say that is because I have been working on mRNA biology [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=912.9599999999999s)]
*  since 1993 for a very long time. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=918.88s)]
*  Up until 2019, nobody cared about any of that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=925.0s)]
*  It was very esoteric and stuck in academia. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=932.12s)]
*  I've seen sort of how my life has changed since 2019 and the explosion of interest into [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=935.9599999999999s)]
*  the research we do, into old things that we had done in the past. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=942.4799999999999s)]
*  It's a floodgate has opened since 2019, 2020 of people wanting to get into this game. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=948.7199999999999s)]
*  Because when it comes to sort of therapeutic development, as you guys know, you've been [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=956.0799999999999s)]
*  doing this for a long time, this podcast. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=960.16s)]
*  Therapeutic development is really very particular. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=963.24s)]
*  You have an indication somebody discovers a small molecule or interesting gene therapy, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=966.2s)]
*  whether that's base editors or CRISPR or something. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=973.4s)]
*  But in the mRNA space, it's so easy to really think about things that you might want to [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  try, whether that's creating antigens or whether that's gene therapies as an mRNA or base editors [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  or CRISPR as an mRNA. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=991.96s)]
*  It's just really easy for people to imagine things they'd want to do. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=994.4000000000001s)]
*  And so that does open this floodgate of like, well, hey, I could try my favorite thing now. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=999.24s)]
*  All I need to do is have some tools on how to do it. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1004.0400000000001s)]
*  And that's the piece right now that a lot of investigators are missing, but they're [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1007.1600000000001s)]
*  eager to get involved. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1010.9200000000001s)]
*  Even before we officially launched this, the rumor mill in Hopkins was brewing and we were [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1013.0s)]
*  getting so much interest of people just coming up and asking, could we do this? [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1019.28s)]
*  And my lab, in fact, started making RNAs for people just on the bench because there was [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1023.72s)]
*  too many people asking us to do this. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1030.04s)]
*  So, you know, when I say that we started out small, we have to because I just think we [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1032.52s)]
*  will get flooded with a lot of requests. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1038.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1041.6399999999999s)]
*  Jeff says he's been working in RNA since 1993. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1042.6399999999999s)]
*  Like what? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1046.48s)]
*  Like you were coloring RNAs with your friends. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1047.48s)]
*  You don't look like you've been you don't look old enough to have been doing anything [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1051.1999999999998s)]
*  since 1993. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1054.04s)]
*  That's very kind of you, but it is a fact. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1055.04s)]
*  I think you've talked a little bit about sort of the state of the mRNA space, what it was [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1061.48s)]
*  prior to the pandemic and now where we are today. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1067.24s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1069.96s)]
*  I think one of the biggest questions I had when hearing about the center is why now? [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1071.44s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1077.32s)]
*  And so I think every good origin story has a why now. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1078.32s)]
*  And you and Michelle and Jeff and you and I, we met just a couple of weeks ago at the [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1082.76s)]
*  Alliance for mRNA Medicines first ascend conference. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1088.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1091.92s)]
*  And so we were kind of privy to a lot of the ongoing challenges that the space is having. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1092.92s)]
*  I'm curious, you know, how would you answer the why now question? [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1098.04s)]
*  Why do you think that the center is so extremely necessary today given what's going on in the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1101.76s)]
*  mRNA space and what are some of the biggest innovations that really you think need to [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1108.56s)]
*  be made in the space that you think the center will really help pave the way towards? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1114.32s)]
*  So maybe we can start with Michelle and jump into jump to Jeff. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1120.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1123.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this also answers who we're trying to serve. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1124.76s)]
*  We are starting with the Hopkins community because as Jeff said, there are a lot of researchers [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1129.36s)]
*  here who are interested in working in mRNA or with RNA generally, but they don't necessarily [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1133.36s)]
*  have exposure or molecular biology skill set in their labs. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1138.32s)]
*  So we want to bridge that divide. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1144.72s)]
*  I think it's a time where a lot of people can start thinking about this new modality. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1148.2s)]
*  It might spark some different novel approaches to treating things that previously were not [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1153.04s)]
*  treatable. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1158.12s)]
*  So I'm so sorry. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1159.3999999999999s)]
*  I just lost track of your question. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1162.1599999999999s)]
*  No, I just what's the origin? [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1163.8s)]
*  You know, why now? [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1166.48s)]
*  Why do you think it's an important time for the center and given this current state of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1167.48s)]
*  the mRNA space? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1172.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1173.0s)]
*  And I think as following up on what Jeff said, because of the pandemic, because of the efficacy [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1174.0s)]
*  proven value of using mRNA medicines, a lot of people want to get into this research area. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1179.44s)]
*  They don't have the skills necessarily, but we do. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1184.3200000000002s)]
*  We can offer them guidance. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1186.56s)]
*  We can offer them resources and we can offer them a pathway to taking their ideas from [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1188.48s)]
*  discovery stage to the point where they might be ready to go to a larger scale study. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1194.0800000000002s)]
*  And I'll just, you know, dovetail on that is the they when there's really two mRNA based [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1200.76s)]
*  therapies that are out there and they really do represent some of the most widely understood [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1209.4s)]
*  and tested therapeutics that have ever come out. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1218.92s)]
*  But they're based on sort of one set of rules in terms of optimization of those. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1223.44s)]
*  And when it would, I mean, the manufacturing is one aspect, but then the biology is another [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1231.3200000000002s)]
*  aspect. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1236.24s)]
*  And how many other things are out there that we haven't tried yet? [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1238.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1242.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they work really well for vaccines, but mRNA as a drug is it is a good drug because [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1243.8400000000001s)]
*  it's cleared by the body. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1252.44s)]
*  It's cleared by the body very rapidly. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1253.88s)]
*  And that's perfect in some applications like a vaccine. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1256.8s)]
*  It's not great if you're trying to do something like a gene replacement or protein replacement [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1260.8200000000002s)]
*  therapy. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1266.04s)]
*  And then, you know, we're learning other things as we move along. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1267.4s)]
*  I mean, the pandemic fueled a need to get these vaccines out right away. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1270.0s)]
*  Both BioNTech, Pfizer and Moderna decided to use M1 pseudo-uridine as their modification. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1276.38s)]
*  Well, that might not have been the best choice now in retrospect because we're getting data [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1286.98s)]
*  coming out in the publication sphere that those modifications will allow for the vaccines [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1291.5400000000002s)]
*  to be useful. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1298.42s)]
*  There could be, you know, unintended read-through events that, you know, we might not want. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1299.7s)]
*  And there's over 150 unique nucleotide modifications that we know of. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1307.26s)]
*  Have we explored that entire space? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1312.04s)]
*  Could we get to a point where we could improve the expression profile of an mRNA and reduce [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1314.52s)]
*  its immunogenicity better than what we already have? [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1322.5s)]
*  And there's real examples where we might need that. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1327.34s)]
*  So for example, you know, it's not a case, it's not, it's not what we've heard from our [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1329.6999999999998s)]
*  colleagues in the government is that the influenza outbreak is not a when, sorry, if it's a when, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1335.34s)]
*  that there will be eventually a large scale influenza outbreak. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1344.86s)]
*  And we're going to need viable vaccines for that. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1350.5s)]
*  In those cases, you often have to mix multiple mRNAs together, but you get to a point where [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1353.98s)]
*  you have too much mRNA per dose. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1360.66s)]
*  And so that creates an immunogenic response. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1364.06s)]
*  And so can we explore technologies, modifications or alterations in mRNA structure that can reduce [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1367.46s)]
*  the overall amount of mRNA needed to get the same amount of protein product and that allows [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1374.1000000000001s)]
*  to go into these more complex therapeutic options. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1379.54s)]
*  And so I think why now? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1384.0600000000002s)]
*  I mean, that was your question. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1385.5800000000002s)]
*  Why now is because we don't have, we, we, we, this technology is powerful. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1386.9s)]
*  We need it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1392.38s)]
*  We're going to need it for rapid responses to pandemics. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1393.5600000000002s)]
*  We're going to need it for other rare diseases that we might want to go after or just simply [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1397.04s)]
*  reducing the costs of already existing therapeutics because it's cheap relative to other therapeutics. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1402.46s)]
*  But the why now is because we don't have the decades of knowledge and how to improve upon [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1409.66s)]
*  the efficacy in vivo, but also the manufacturing. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1418.8600000000001s)]
*  And you could even see from the event you were talking about, the Alliance for mRNA [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1422.14s)]
*  medicines event, there's so much interest in just the manufacturing alone and how we [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1426.3s)]
*  can reduce the cost and make things better and safer. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1430.7s)]
*  So it really is an important moment. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1435.5s)]
*  An understanding too. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1437.98s)]
*  I think during that conference, there was a really good quote about how we, we know, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1438.9399999999998s)]
*  so we've done decades and decades of research into protein structure, right? [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1444.3s)]
*  But there's still very little understanding of RNA structure in and of itself. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1448.22s)]
*  And so, you know, a lot of the work that you guys are really well suited to address, right, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1453.02s)]
*  is to help us sort of answer the questions that maybe biotechs today are not quite capable [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1458.4599999999998s)]
*  of answering yet or because of different risk tolerance, right? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1465.02s)]
*  And regulatory tolerance, there can be some limitations there commercially that aren't [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1469.1s)]
*  necessarily faced with academic research. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1475.5s)]
*  So yeah, that begs the question. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1477.9s)]
*  What Anna-Rose was just mentioning begs the question. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1480.86s)]
*  And Jeff, when you were sort of giving us the big picture earlier in the conversation [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1483.98s)]
*  around what the center intends to do, you hinted at the center being a support mechanism [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1489.02s)]
*  beyond just creating a sandbox for scientific experiments. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1496.7s)]
*  You know, you hinted at the translational capabilities, the relationship with Trilink [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1501.9s)]
*  being sort of foundational to your point, being able to take some of these ideas eventually [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1507.42s)]
*  into the clinic. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1513.82s)]
*  What does that infrastructure look like at the center right now? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1515.5s)]
*  And what do you aspire for that, I guess, infrastructure functionality to look like [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1518.94s)]
*  in terms of a business support mechanism versus just some lab space and some, you know, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1525.42s)]
*  highly decorated scientists who can help you work on your science experiments? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1532.62s)]
*  I mean, the way I see it is so by the relationship with Trilink really gives us a lot of [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1537.58s)]
*  I don't know what I want to say to say. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1545.5s)]
*  Well, it's powerful because you're using essentially their SOP to make the mRNA. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1546.86s)]
*  And it's essentially the same SOP that a GMP mRNA would be made at, but it's not GMP. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1552.3799999999999s)]
*  So what that means is that the researcher, again, I think I've said this before, but [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1560.86s)]
*  the researcher can take it from the preclinical state to the clinical market without having [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1564.78s)]
*  to do too much new optimization. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1569.8999999999999s)]
*  So I think that's an important piece because things can break between preclinical studies [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1572.46s)]
*  and clinical studies, and you don't want that to happen. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1577.3400000000001s)]
*  But I think from sort of the support and business structure is it's really this [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1580.46s)]
*  reiterative approach where, you know, if you can give an investigator an mRNA at a cost, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1585.66s)]
*  essentially for materials, and then they're testing it and they see whatever it is that [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1593.1000000000001s)]
*  they want to see, they might come back to us and then say, hey, we need a little bit more. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1597.98s)]
*  We need either to we're getting too much, you know, off-target effects or the immune [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1603.5s)]
*  reactions are too high, toxins too high, something. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1608.6200000000001s)]
*  So we can try and play with that to get to a point where they're happy with the outcomes [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1611.34s)]
*  that they're getting that then might allow them to move on to either new co-startup or [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1617.98s)]
*  licensing it to a pre-existing biotech. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1623.74s)]
*  With a product, essentially, that has been very well vetted in the academic clinical [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1626.8600000000001s)]
*  setting, hospital setting here at Hopkins. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1632.5400000000002s)]
*  So I think that provides a lot of value because you don't often see that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1636.22s)]
*  And it's certainly, I mean, again, this goes back to this valley of death issue. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1640.7800000000002s)]
*  There's a lot of great ideas that start in laboratories like mine that just wither on [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1644.46s)]
*  the vine either because they can't leap that valley or when they do traverse that valley, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1651.02s)]
*  they die of starvation because there's just not enough energy to keep them going [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1657.42s)]
*  to get it into the market space. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1664.54s)]
*  So I think we can help provide some of that by offering, you know, input and looking at their [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1667.02s)]
*  data, helping to evaluate and then really seeing what more levers can we pull to get them to the [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1673.58s)]
*  place that they really need to be. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1680.14s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1683.3400000000001s)]
*  Because if you were to have a company make an mRNA for you, they might charge you a lot of money [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1684.3000000000002s)]
*  to get milligrams of one type of mRNA molecule. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1691.9s)]
*  What we hope to do is be able to charge less because we'd be charging them that cost plus [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1696.38s)]
*  labor and then we could give them a panel. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1701.74s)]
*  So instead of getting one type of mRNA molecule, they can get 10, right? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1704.5400000000002s)]
*  And they would all vary in different ways that we think might be beneficial, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1708.9399999999998s)]
*  so it's expression or stability. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1712.62s)]
*  And then they can see which one is the best in their assays. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1714.6999999999998s)]
*  So it's a much more powerful approach when they're working with us. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1717.9799999999998s)]
*  Orthogonal. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1724.1399999999999s)]
*  And then eventually, yeah. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1724.78s)]
*  And what we really hope to do is we having all this under sort of one clearinghouse [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1727.1799999999998s)]
*  is we learn from each of these programs that we assist. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1733.34s)]
*  So if we have investigators that are doing new antigen therapy in the pancreas, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1737.1s)]
*  we take that information back with us and we learn something about what worked there [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1741.4199999999998s)]
*  and what didn't work. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1746.78s)]
*  And then the next person who comes up and wants to start a program somewhere else, [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1748.06s)]
*  we learn from that. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1752.86s)]
*  And over time, we're gaining expertise about when do you need to have ultra pure RNA? [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1754.46s)]
*  When do you tolerate a little bit less purity? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1761.82s)]
*  When would it be great to have this particular type of RNA modification or this [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1765.4199999999998s)]
*  particular UTR or whatever it might be or LNP formulation by gaining that information, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1772.22s)]
*  keeping it in our records and then advising, we're educating ourselves. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1779.6599999999999s)]
*  We're educating our own community to help. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1785.82s)]
*  And so it's creating value to the center itself. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1789.1799999999998s)]
*  What are the resource? [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1792.94s)]
*  Like, what's the resource picture look like? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1795.66s)]
*  You talk about the expertise and the research. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1799.74s)]
*  Are you relying on Johns Hopkins personnel to contribute to assisting with this research [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1803.98s)]
*  and playing a role here? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1810.54s)]
*  Or does the center have its own staff? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1811.5s)]
*  Like, what do those look like? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1815.3400000000001s)]
*  So in terms of like the financial aspects, this was a joint venture between Hopkins [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1817.5s)]
*  and the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1822.94s)]
*  Sorry, between Tri-Link and the Whiting School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1826.46s)]
*  So Tri-Link and Johns Hopkins put in equal amounts of money to launch the center. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1830.94s)]
*  And it's a five-year agreement currently. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1839.3400000000001s)]
*  So the employees of the center are employed by Johns Hopkins through that money. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1843.3400000000001s)]
*  But as with any academic center, it's never a money-making business. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1847.66s)]
*  It's basically break even. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1851.34s)]
*  That's it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1852.3799999999999s)]
*  And so we charge for our services enough to keep everything balanced. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1853.4199999999998s)]
*  But we are an academic unit, so we also can apply for grants and take donations. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1861.6599999999999s)]
*  If you want to send us a check, go ahead. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1866.4599999999998s)]
*  Just going to slide that little thing in there. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1869.4199999999998s)]
*  Directly to my home. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1874.54s)]
*  So Matt and I are supposed to show up at 8 a.m. tomorrow and also pay to play. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1875.6599999999999s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1882.3799999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1882.86s)]
*  That's right. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1883.74s)]
*  I'll send you my Venmo account. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1884.22s)]
*  I'm on it. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1887.74s)]
*  But we anticipate that we will have multiple, like any other academic center, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1889.98s)]
*  we're going to be applying for grants. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1898.9399999999998s)]
*  We'll be applying for grants with other investigators. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1900.6999999999998s)]
*  And eventually there will be a production of IP that will come back to the center. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1904.0600000000002s)]
*  And all of that sort of hopefully in time becomes self-reinforcing and sustains the operations. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1908.22s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1918.3000000000002s)]
*  That's another question I had for you was what claim the center and Johns Hopkins might stake [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1918.54s)]
*  in the potential value of some of these assets that you're helping to create? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1927.02s)]
*  What does that business model look like? [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1932.62s)]
*  Or is it sort of TBD? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1934.62s)]
*  Well, I think they're standard. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1937.4199999999998s)]
*  That's all stuff that's controlled by our tech transfer office at Johns Hopkins, [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1939.26s)]
*  which at Hopkins is called the Johns Hopkins Tech Venture, so JHTV. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1943.7399999999998s)]
*  And with anything that comes out of Johns Hopkins that's Hopkins IP, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1949.9799999999998s)]
*  they have the rights over that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1959.02s)]
*  And when a new code is started, then the license has to be negotiated with Johns Hopkins. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1962.3799999999999s)]
*  That's a very standard operational procedure for any university and how they spin out companies. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1969.34s)]
*  And that's really it, is that if we develop things at Johns Hopkins, then [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1976.94s)]
*  if the investigator wants to patent that, then they're welcome to do that. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1984.94s)]
*  And it's all done through the terms of Johns Hopkins University. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1989.82s)]
*  What about the Trilink influence there? [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1994.78s)]
*  Is there any strings attached to Trilink for these investigators who are coming in [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=1996.78s)]
*  and have the potential to take something into a manufacturable state? [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2001.82s)]
*  I mean, Trilink, they're very generous in this regard. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2007.9s)]
*  I mean, they would like the right to look at it, but that's essentially it, meaning that they [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2010.6200000000001s)]
*  have the right to look at it and potentially offer licensing terms, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2018.54s)]
*  but our investigators can say no. And so it's very generous. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2023.26s)]
*  They're very supportive. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2028.3s)]
*  An important point for any would-be players who are like, [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2030.78s)]
*  what would I be tying myself down to? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2036.06s)]
*  Well, I think from Trilink's perspective, what they really are hoping for [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2038.6999999999998s)]
*  is because the investigators are entering in early in their development and we're using their SOP. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2043.02s)]
*  So it's the clean cap and the clean strip protocol that they're putting more shots on goal [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2049.5s)]
*  to get molecules into their GMP. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2056.62s)]
*  We don't really want to start making GMP mRNA at Hopkins. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2060.54s)]
*  It's a whole different ball game. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2064.7799999999997s)]
*  Different ball game, yeah. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2066.94s)]
*  Yeah. And since we are using their protocols, we would be sending business to them. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2068.06s)]
*  And so that's what they get out of it more than anything. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2077.42s)]
*  So a lot of the de-risking is done. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2079.98s)]
*  What they probably see is that most of the de-risking is done with us to the academic center [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2082.78s)]
*  and then they get the good stuff that they can make on GMP. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2087.58s)]
*  But in terms of IP, there's no tether. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2092.86s)]
*  Yeah. So go ahead, Michelle. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2098.7s)]
*  I was just going to say, Trilink is extremely supportive of this endeavor. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2102.54s)]
*  And in fact, they had a small team here last week walking us through their SOPs. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2107.9s)]
*  So they're there, they answer many questions and they're offering their help all the time. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2113.18s)]
*  So yes, the idea is because of this relationship, [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2119.58s)]
*  the transition to larger scale production should be seamless. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2123.18s)]
*  Mm-hmm. So, Jeff, you'd mentioned that in the past, your lab had been making quite a bit of RNA, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2128.7s)]
*  as things were coming up and questions were being raised and folks were... [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2136.86s)]
*  RNA was getting a lot hotter. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2141.5s)]
*  I'm curious to kind of get a trajectory here of some of the innovations that your lab has been [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2143.7400000000002s)]
*  involved with on the scientific side for RNA. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2150.06s)]
*  Leading up to this point, first of all, where have you been particularly active in mRNA and [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2153.74s)]
*  next-gen RNA? Prior to the launch of the center and then also how you see that supporting some [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2160.3799999999997s)]
*  of the work that you're going to be doing moving forward with the center? [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2168.14s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, my lab has really, for a very long time, worked on stability of mRNAs. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2172.9399999999996s)]
*  That's kind of what our bread and butter is. And so when people have asked us to work with them on [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2178.54s)]
*  therapeutic RNAs, we try to integrate all of our teachings that we've learned on mRNA stability [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2185.18s)]
*  into those molecules. And that's sort of our knee-jerk reflex is to make sure that we design it [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2192.38s)]
*  the way we think it should be designed, which is not necessarily as intuitive as you might think, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2200.22s)]
*  because we know a lot more about all the various little features that control stability. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2205.5s)]
*  It's not as simple as just going to some web protocol and hitting, like, optimize my RNA and [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2210.62s)]
*  poof, there it is. Yeah, there's a lot more that goes into it. The other side of it is [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2218.14s)]
*  I'm really fascinated by the RNA modification space because that is an area we just simply have, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2226.46s)]
*  like I said, we're an N of one here, where it's M1 pseudo-U is what everybody throws in for the [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2233.74s)]
*  most part. I mean, there are a few others, but there's so many other RNA modifications out there [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2239.4199999999996s)]
*  yet to be explored that could really be used for particular applications. And then lastly, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2244.7s)]
*  the one that, you know, Matt was laughing, I said I was been working on this since 1993, it's true. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2252.2999999999997s)]
*  And back then, we were, you know, when somebody would say, because we used to program [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2259.1s)]
*  cells with mRNA back then, we would inject mRNAs into o-sites and stuff and reprogram cells and [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2264.86s)]
*  people would play with this idea, could you use it as a therapy? Well, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2271.18s)]
*  no, because it was delivery, delivery, delivery, delivery. Delivery is always the problem. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2274.46s)]
*  How do you get the transcript to the cell that you care about? And, you know, back then, nobody was [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2278.86s)]
*  really even thinking about the LNP space as a way to not only deliver an RNA, but also to optimize [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2285.1s)]
*  delivery to specific cell types, as well as affect durability and efficacy. So what's really exciting [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2293.18s)]
*  to me is to have the center right next to these researchers that are world-class LNP experts and [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2299.18s)]
*  start exploring that space together, because it is true that we're not going to innovate unless [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2307.42s)]
*  we can do that. So that's another place where we've had some success, you know, on this sort of [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2313.26s)]
*  individual basis of, you know, here's an RNA, here's an application, let's talk to our colleagues, [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2319.5s)]
*  do they have an LNP that might work? And all of this will have to be sort of combined as things [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2326.2200000000003s)]
*  change. For example, if you start changing modifications on an mRNA, that's going to change [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2332.38s)]
*  its chemical property, as so how that gets packaged into the LNP is going to be different. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2337.6600000000003s)]
*  Huge question. Yeah. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2342.54s)]
*  Yeah. So how do you, you know, you have to optimize in that space. You can't just say, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2344.06s)]
*  hey, I just discovered this novel way of modifying an mRNA that really works great, but [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2349.5s)]
*  try to package it into a generic LNP and it doesn't do anything. So having those pieces [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2355.9s)]
*  together is really important. An integrated approach for drug development. Yeah. Michelle, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2361.02s)]
*  did you have anything to add or you have a background in the RNA world, right? So I mean, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2368.06s)]
*  are there innovations that you are most excited to see the center tackle in the upcoming year or [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2372.7799999999997s)]
*  two as you set out to be COO, right? To operationalize all of these, all of the goals you guys have. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2381.34s)]
*  Are you most excited about anything that you guys are going to be working on in particular? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2391.1s)]
*  Any innovations you see made? Well, we'll start with mRNAs and Jeff's lab has made a lot of [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2396.7s)]
*  very valuable discoveries and how to increase the stability. And as Jeff has often said, [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2404.8599999999997s)]
*  if stability is increased, then you're going to have expression. So this is going to be really [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2411.5s)]
*  important. There were a lot of things that I saw at the meeting in Boston last week. Was that last [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2415.66s)]
*  week? Two weeks ago. It was like it was two weeks. Yeah. No, there are a lot of people. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2420.78s)]
*  I know it really does. A lot of people doing work on self-amplifying RNAs. So that's an intriguing [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2426.7000000000003s)]
*  area that we don't have experience in hands on yet, but a lot of people are asking about that. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2434.46s)]
*  And that also is going to have issues with packaging because those tend to be much larger [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2442.3s)]
*  molecules. So I'm really eager to see what happens in that space. And just how mRNAs are [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2446.7s)]
*  used in areas where they haven't been used before, such as like new antigen therapy. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2455.74s)]
*  Sorry, I'm getting a cold. No, no. You jinxed me. I wonder where I came from. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2461.74s)]
*  Yeah. Or for delivering enzymes and base editing and CRISPR editing. So I think a lot of people [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2467.98s)]
*  are trying to switch to that. So I think that's a really important area. We're probably going to [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2476.3s)]
*  see a lot of people asking us about that. But yeah, I think self-amplifying RNA is an interesting [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2479.98s)]
*  space. I know Jeff and I have talked about that before. It has its pros and cons, but [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2490.3s)]
*  it's nice because you can deliver less and potentially get more expression. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2496.0600000000004s)]
*  And potentially unmodified. There's a lot of hope that you can get the RNA to just simply be [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2503.18s)]
*  unmodified and then reduce the overall... Because again, this whole idea of reducing the effective [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2509.02s)]
*  dose is very important. If you're stuck at like a hundred micrograms of RNA, which is what Moderna [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2515.98s)]
*  was at, it really kind of puts you at a... That's a lot of RNA. But if you can get it... And what [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2525.5s)]
*  I've heard from some of the self-amplifying folks is that they're down to like 0.25 micrograms. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2532.7s)]
*  So it's a pretty significant difference. And that puts you into a new realm of where you can start [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2537.74s)]
*  mixing and matching different strands for complex processes, whether that's like some sort of [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2547.82s)]
*  gene editing or if it is a pan-viral vaccine that you want to generate. So you can have five [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2555.34s)]
*  or six different transcripts in there to try and get the best response that you can possibly get. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2564.7000000000003s)]
*  So those are all things that we really need to explore. Yeah. And these explorations, I mean, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2571.34s)]
*  I'm reading between the lines as you talk about them and their translation to the business aspect. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2578.3s)]
*  This isn't just a science experiment. This isn't just doing cool stuff. It's like, [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2587.5s)]
*  these are the things that we need to do in order to move the business forward. And I'm curious about [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2590.94s)]
*  that because I don't think it can be overstated that this isn't just an academic exercise and [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2596.78s)]
*  that you two both bring to the table a bunch of industry and vendor-supplier experience. You both [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2602.46s)]
*  worked in the biotech space. You've got, like I said, a supply experience. So I'm just curious [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2611.02s)]
*  about what kind of mindshare that industry experience you're bringing to bear as you form [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2618.2200000000003s)]
*  the center up and create the vision and make it what you intend it to be. How have those [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2627.66s)]
*  experiences that you've had in the industry, the business of biotech, informed the way that you're [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2635.2599999999998s)]
*  setting up to help other companies build and grow? You want to start there, Michelle? [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2641.58s)]
*  I think Jeff handles that at the macro scale and I handle that at the micro scale, which is to say [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2649.42s)]
*  Jeff established the center. There are a lot of players involved, not just Charlie Goodhopkins, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2656.06s)]
*  but all the individual players within these two different organizations. So bringing the center [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2662.86s)]
*  into existence was no small feat. And then here, getting operations going at the micro scale, [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2667.3399999999997s)]
*  I think because of my experience before in a small startup and then in a larger company, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2675.98s)]
*  it was an eye-opener to me coming from grad school and a postdoc, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2681.3399999999997s)]
*  where you're in a very academic mindset. It's very different than when you're in a company. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2687.8199999999997s)]
*  When you are trying to sell something or help people, you have to be very customer oriented. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2693.1s)]
*  You need to know how to keep stakeholder engagement. You need to know never to say no [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2698.7799999999997s)]
*  or never to say it with that word. You need to understand, like you're trying to understand [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2704.54s)]
*  what do people need and then how can you deliver to them and how can you describe to them what you [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2709.66s)]
*  can and can't deliver. So I think those are the skill sets that I bring from my previous experience [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2715.1s)]
*  and I hope it pays off. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2722.7s)]
*  Just to add on that, I think I started my first biotech company back in 2018, 2017. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2729.58s)]
*  And it's Tevard Biosciences. I started that company with Harvey Lodish and he's really [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2739.66s)]
*  been kind of a sort of icon of biotech development. And I learned a lot from him. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2746.2999999999997s)]
*  But one thing you do learn in talking to investors and talking to other players in the space, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2754.14s)]
*  leaders in the space is, and it goes to why this center really is important, is that [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2760.7799999999997s)]
*  you have to hit the ground running when you start a new startup. You have a very limited time. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2767.34s)]
*  And so you have to identify a niche that you can occupy that you bring value to. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2773.02s)]
*  And that's really where I think we can help in this arena is if you have investigators [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2778.06s)]
*  that are coming to us and they, hey, they want to do this, that, or the other thing, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2785.82s)]
*  you know, it's fine if you're getting a publication, great. But if you actually want [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2790.1400000000003s)]
*  to spin that out to make a company, well, then what is the real value of that product? [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2796.06s)]
*  What does it bring to the table? And we can help with that narrative by saying, well, [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2800.94s)]
*  you know, we understand the mRNA space and we know that, you know, that you have lots of [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2808.86s)]
*  competition over here, but you might have a singularity here that could be explored and [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2814.86s)]
*  and provide value that investors would be very interested in seeing. So, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2821.34s)]
*  you know, we don't, and we don't work alone in that regard. I mean, we have the tremendous [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2827.1000000000004s)]
*  support of, you know, Johns Hopkins technical ventures and as well as our own, you know, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2830.46s)]
*  contacts in the field. So I, you know, I anticipate that the center will provide, [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2836.86s)]
*  you know, we do more than just science at this center. You've mentioned we're part of this [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2844.86s)]
*  alliance for mRNA medicines and that is another aspect because it allows us to really connect [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2849.9s)]
*  people with other industrial leaders. And we have over 60 to 70 members of that alliance now that [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2855.26s)]
*  we're part of. And that network is very valuable and will be valuable to our clientele as we move [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2862.14s)]
*  forward. Yeah. I was, you know, you'd mentioned something too about how you can kind of help [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2869.5s)]
*  your knowledge of the mRNA space can help folks connect their product or their research, right, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2875.98s)]
*  to some of the overarching needs of that space. And there's a lot of best practices, I think, [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2882.14s)]
*  and in terms of, you know, how you can launch a business and best leadership practices that [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2887.42s)]
*  that are that are really modality agnostic. But I'm curious, you know, with your background, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2892.06s)]
*  both of your backgrounds being in this RNA world and having seen the RNA world pre-COVID [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2898.78s)]
*  when no one really gave it gave it the respect that it was due, right? You know, are there any [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2905.74s)]
*  RNA specific insights that you think are really important for folks to keep in mind as they are [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2912.3799999999997s)]
*  launching an RNA business? You know, I like to kind of dig into some of the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2918.8599999999997s)]
*  individual nuances, right, that come from from modality specific learnings and running a business. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2925.58s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think what we can see from what's happened over the last five years, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2932.54s)]
*  the use of mRNA in vaccines is never going to go away. That's never going to go away. That's [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2939.34s)]
*  something that, you know, that genies out of the bottle. And, and there's a lot of issues around [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2944.7799999999997s)]
*  vaccines and political things, blah, blah, blah, but it's not going to go away. It's just too, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2949.66s)]
*  too easy works too well. And not that it works too well works great. But I think where we're [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2955.5s)]
*  really seeing incredible promise is in new antigen therapy for mRNA. Again, the idea that you can [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2962.46s)]
*  design personalized, a personalized therapy for an individual with like pancreatic cancer and [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2971.34s)]
*  have that, you know, the successes that we're seeing in the last two years in, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2978.7s)]
*  in pancreatic cancer with new antigen approaches is really tremendous. That, you know, this was a [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2984.38s)]
*  disease where it's really a death sentence, but was leading at least to half the people in that [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2990.38s)]
*  study were, were still alive several years later. And so that's going to continue. And it's, there's [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=2996.1400000000003s)]
*  very clear path to using mRNA in the new antigen approaches. It's not going to work. You know, [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3003.7400000000002s)]
*  the mRNA is another, it's another modality in our therapeutic arsenal. It's not going to work for [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3009.82s)]
*  everything, but it is going to work for these other applications. And I think, and I don't think [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3016.22s)]
*  this is a crazy vision. I think you're going to see in the next five to 10 years, or point of care [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3022.4599999999996s)]
*  therapeutic development, where you have major medical centers like Johns Hopkins or [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3029.58s)]
*  some catering or, you know, Houston Methodist creating their own programs to make personalized [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3035.5s)]
*  medicines on site where, you know, you get diagnosed with some rare disease or rare cancer. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3042.94s)]
*  You go there and they, they help design a therapy in the house and you, you, you get that therapy. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3051.26s)]
*  Now, how that all gets paid for, that's a different issue, but you know, the technology is such that [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3060.06s)]
*  we can do it as point of care. And, you know, and that's going to expand that will expand beyond [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3065.02s)]
*  the medical community also into like agriculture and starting to treat, you know, our food supply [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3070.7s)]
*  before some of these pathogens emerge into, into the human population. mRNA is a very low cost, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3079.8199999999997s)]
*  viable approach to start, you know, using on some of our livestock and animal products. So. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3088.7s)]
*  Yeah. Wouldn't that be amazing? Sorry. If we could decrease use of antibiotics and, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3097.34s)]
*  and yeah, animal farming and then maybe reduce the use of pesticides. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3104.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. It's something we often don't talk about a lot in biotech is where, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3108.78s)]
*  you know, you have certain approaches like mRNA that can cross just from, you don't necessarily [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3114.2200000000003s)]
*  have to deploy it just to humans. That technology is just as viable in other animals. So, [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3119.42s)]
*  and because it's low cost that that reduces that barrier. So, yeah. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3124.86s)]
*  Yeah. Jeff, you talked about the valley of death earlier and you talked about the likelihood of [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3130.78s)]
*  death, even if you make it across the valley of death, you're very uplifting man. Very inspiring. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3135.9s)]
*  There's a movie coming soon. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3142.78s)]
*  I'm curious though. And, you know, you talked about some of, you know, some of some of the [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3146.7000000000003s)]
*  causes of that mortality, but I'm curious if you, you've seen a lot of this, like you've seen a lot [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3151.42s)]
*  of academic exercises that showed glimpses of commercial promise and opportunity and you've [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3155.66s)]
*  seen them, you know, go north and go south. If, and I'm going to ask you a hard question to answer [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3160.62s)]
*  right now. And I apologize for it in advance. If you're going to put your next paycheck on a bet. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3166.06s)]
*  We really are going hard here. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3173.58s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there's there. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3175.1s)]
*  Michelle, you want in on this too? [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3178.06s)]
*  If you're going to risk not feeding your family for a week. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3181.5s)]
*  You're raising the bar way too after this question. It's not that good. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3187.8199999999997s)]
*  But it is challenging to answer. If you had to, you know, let's say you got, you got, [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3192.06s)]
*  you got six ideas in the lab right now. Each of them have their own, you know, own glimpse of, [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3195.66s)]
*  of commercial promise down the road. But you got to put your money on what's going to go wrong. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3201.18s)]
*  Cause you've seen it go wrong before. Like what's that knowledge gap or that, you know, [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3206.8599999999997s)]
*  that, that missing piece that, that so often do dooms these projects early. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3211.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the biggest thing that dooms almost any biotech is, you know, efficacy versus talks. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3220.8599999999997s)]
*  Right. Like how much benefit do you get for the risk? And is it a, is that tolerable? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3230.7s)]
*  And we see this all the time where there's gene therapies that are going to do great things, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3241.66s)]
*  but then we get them into the clinic and there's very little success. You know, we've, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3248.54s)]
*  as everybody's said, and you probably heard a million times in this podcast is that it's [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3255.1s)]
*  really easy to cure a mouse. There's really, you know, we've eliminated cancer and most genetic [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3258.78s)]
*  diseases in mice a thousand fold. But applying academic research to the human body is much more [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3264.2200000000003s)]
*  difficult. And so getting good efficacy and low talks is what is critical. Without that, you, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3271.9s)]
*  you don't get out the door. And so if I was betting, you know, in the place where I think [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3280.7000000000003s)]
*  a lot of people have made these bets historically is always in the cancer space because the risk, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3287.18s)]
*  the benefit ratio is so different versus other places, you know, prophylactic vaccines, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3292.2999999999997s)]
*  you've got a huge, you know, risk benefit analysis that has to be done. He cannot cause harm there at [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3299.5s)]
*  all. And it has to be efficacious. And there's a, you know, there's a lot of political aspects [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3306.14s)]
*  about that too, but in the cancer space, really, I haven't heard. Well, you know, the whole, [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3310.94s)]
*  vaccine space. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3317.66s)]
*  We could go down a whole different podcast for that one. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3319.8999999999996s)]
*  But, you know, coming soon, coming soon to a podcast near you. But cancer is embedding [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3325.5s)]
*  where the next sort of wildly successful mRNA therapy is going to be is in these really hard [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3334.8599999999997s)]
*  to get to cancers, these recalcitrant cancers, like, like pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3344.22s)]
*  where we can try, you know, we can take a lot more risk there because the benefit is so high. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3351.98s)]
*  And you, you know, that allows for innovation that then can eventually allow us to do things like [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3359.9s)]
*  monogenetic gene replacement, and which has its, has its challenges. [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3366.54s)]
*  You know, the challenge there is the durability of the mRNA. The mRNA, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3375.58s)]
*  the reason why I study mRNA is because it goes away. That is my job. I've studied mRNA stability [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3384.3s)]
*  for decades, and it goes away and it goes away fairly quickly. And so for protein, [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3389.1s)]
*  you know, protein replacement strategy, unless we improve the durability or we improve or have, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3395.18s)]
*  or if it's an indication that allows for repeat dosing, then we're sort of limited there. So [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3402.94s)]
*  from a bedding standpoint, if somebody had a really good cancer, new antigen treatment, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3409.5s)]
*  that's where I'd be bedding. All right. You heard her here first. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3414.3s)]
*  But these are just, I provide no market advice. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3420.22s)]
*  Remember, there's a paycheck writing on this. So if anyone's listening who pays the [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3423.5s)]
*  Jeff's bills over here, we'll put a disclosure in the show and protect you from any legal [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3431.42s)]
*  responsibility. We're going to need to land this airplane. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3439.9s)]
*  I know. We'd love to keep the planes flying. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3445.1s)]
*  I've got a couple more, but I don't want to give you short shrift. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3448.86s)]
*  Well, so I guess it's more of an overarching question, just sort of, you know, we've talked [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3453.2599999999998s)]
*  about why academia is a great place to do some of the R&D that we really need today. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3458.2999999999997s)]
*  Right. And so I'm curious, just as we're looking forward into the future and just in your experience [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3464.2999999999997s)]
*  so far with the center, you know, have you seen an increasing amount of interest from industry [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3471.18s)]
*  in partnering more closely with academia over the past year, two years? And do you see that, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3478.94s)]
*  you know, now that the center's fully fledged and formed and exists, [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3484.78s)]
*  do you see that interest continuing to increase? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3488.86s)]
*  Yeah, I think so. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3493.66s)]
*  100%. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3495.5s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think that's definitely evidenced here with our partnership with Tri-Link, but [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3497.34s)]
*  when I was in PacBio, I mean, they and other companies that I had spoken with, like everybody [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3502.14s)]
*  is understanding or realizing the real value of academic centers for discovery, right? Because, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3508.46s)]
*  you know, as we've talked about earlier, it's just, it's an inhibited prospect if you're in a [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3514.2200000000003s)]
*  biotech company or pharma company where you have timelines and deadlines and programs. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3520.38s)]
*  So I think companies are going to continue to grow their interest in trying to partner with [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3524.38s)]
*  academic institutions to help foster these early ideas and, you know, with the idea that it's going [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3529.98s)]
*  to come back to them so they can work on the other end of the research pipeline. Yeah. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3535.18s)]
*  For sure. [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3541.98s)]
*  Yeah. And this modality really is sort of unique among all other modalities out there because [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3543.4199999999996s)]
*  it's not like if you're doing a small molecule, how are you going to reiterate that and learn [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3549.18s)]
*  where here, you know, it's a basic building block. It has to do one thing, which is to make a protein. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3555.5s)]
*  And so there's a rule book for that. And, but we can, you know, it is the messenger of the genetic [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3562.46s)]
*  code and we can get it to communicate any information we want. And so that's where, [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3571.82s)]
*  why industry is so fascinated by this technology and why they're approaching [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3579.26s)]
*  places like us in order to say, well, what can we do together? And, you know, I only see that [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3584.06s)]
*  interest continuing to go up and up and up in the next few years. This is a technology [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3592.22s)]
*  that's simply not going to go away. It's not. I like to hear that. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3597.8999999999996s)]
*  At the helm of a publication called Advancing RNA, we certainly hope it goes nowhere. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3604.8599999999997s)]
*  I've come to your greenhouse. What's the next big agenda item for the RNA Innovation Center in [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3609.18s)]
*  terms of its growth and development and go forward plan? Well, as of Thanksgiving, we are [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3618.22s)]
*  fully operational. So, because we were in the building stage until right now. So we have a [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3626.2999999999997s)]
*  number of projects that are on deck. We're going to be able to dive into them now. So that is the [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3633.98s)]
*  first step. And as we grow these smaller individual faculty-based projects, we want to expand out from [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3640.54s)]
*  there. And we have some conversations going on about how to leverage this technology in unique [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3652.14s)]
*  ways. We're talking with the Applied Physics Lab here at Johns Hopkins. And maybe there are [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3658.54s)]
*  things that we can do outside of medicine, more in sort of the technical space, and continue to work [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3663.98s)]
*  with our partners in the federal government to push this technology in a unique fashion. So [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3672.86s)]
*  we're really interested in partnering with groups that want to take on large problems. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3681.2599999999998s)]
*  Because I think that's where we're particularly good, or will become very good at, is not just [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3687.9s)]
*  meeting the needs of the individual, but also of the bigger industry as a whole. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3694.86s)]
*  Where should those groups, those potential partners and researchers who are interested in [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3701.1000000000004s)]
*  learning more about what you guys are doing, where can they learn more? Where can they be in touch [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3707.82s)]
*  with you? They can either contact me or Michelle Druckley, or we have a website. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUbNT5-Np38&t=3712.06s)]
