Video Description: On this week's episode, Dr. Srinivas Rao, co-founder and CEO at atai Life Sciences, explains how his engineering background led him to the development of psychedelic compounds for treating depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Internal drug development efforts at atai are focused on short-duration psychedelics that can work within existing healthcare infrastructure, with the potential to transform the treatment of mental health disorders. Rao also talks about atai's hub and spoke model for investing in other psychedelic companies, what MAPS/Lykos Therapeutics got wrong in the run-up to FDA's review of Lykos's MDMA candidate for PTSD, and whether psychedelic therapies need the "trip" to catalyze network disruption and neuroplasticity in the brain.

*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=44.0s)]
*  I'm Ben Comer, Chief Editor at Life Science Leader, and I'm speaking today with Dr. Srinivas Rao, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=46.0s)]
*  co-founder and CEO of Attai Life Sciences, a company developing psychedelic compounds for the treatment of mental health disorders [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=52.0s)]
*  such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and opioid use disorder. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=60.0s)]
*  Dr. Rao earned his medical degree as well as his PhD in neurobiology at Yale, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=65.0s)]
*  and he also holds a master's degree in electrical engineering also from Yale. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=71.0s)]
*  His career in the life sciences has included multiple scientific officer, chief scientific officer, I should say, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=76.0s)]
*  and chief medical officer roles, as well as two previous CEO roles at Entheogenics Biosciences and Kylan Biosciences. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=84.0s)]
*  Prior to becoming CEO at Attai, Dr. Rao was the company's chief scientific officer for five years. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=94.0s)]
*  On today's show, we're going to get to know Dr. Rao and find out what's happening in the psychedelic therapy space, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=102.0s)]
*  what's unique and challenging about this segment of drug development, how Attai Life Sciences has changed since its inception in 2018, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=108.0s)]
*  and what kind of impact FDA-approved psychedelic drugs could have on patients with mental health disorders. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=118.0s)]
*  Dr. Rao, thanks so much for being here today. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=124.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me, Ben, and thanks for the very generous introduction. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=127.0s)]
*  Absolutely. I'm excited to speak with you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=130.0s)]
*  The famous American engineer Henry Petrosky said, science is about knowing, engineering is about doing. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=133.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=143.0s)]
*  You are an engineer by training. When did you know that you wanted to be an engineer? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=144.0s)]
*  You know, that's been something that has been part of my personality for a long time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=151.0s)]
*  I've always enjoyed tinkering. I've always enjoyed building things. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=157.0s)]
*  I think that was a really important element to it. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=161.0s)]
*  So once I got to school, I was really looking. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=163.0s)]
*  I mean, I, pre-med was always something that was kind of kicking around. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=167.0s)]
*  I enjoy, I always enjoyed aspects of medicine. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=171.0s)]
*  But once I got to school, I mean, I was really focused on either being a physics major or going into engineering. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=175.0s)]
*  And after taking, you know, after freshman year, I think it became pretty obvious to me which way I was going to go. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=183.0s)]
*  Again, really enjoyed the building and the problem solving element of engineering. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=189.0s)]
*  And indeed, all my undergraduate projects and in fact, even the master's projects were all biomedical in nature. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=195.0s)]
*  Was there a specific class in those undergraduate years that, you know, really helped you make up your mind? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=202.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I it's it's been a while. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=210.0s)]
*  I certainly took some of the basic engineering class. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=215.0s)]
*  I mean, I'd always played with electronics. Yeah. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=218.0s)]
*  It's something I'd always been interested in. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=220.0s)]
*  So I had a pretty intensive, I had an intensive and literally intensive introductory physics class freshman year. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=222.0s)]
*  Enjoyed it a lot. Really small classes like seven of us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=231.0s)]
*  But it was more, you know, I met a lot of people that were really strong on the theoretical side. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=234.0s)]
*  And through the course of that class, met a lot of people that were really strong on the mathematical side of physics. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=242.0s)]
*  And so just realized that, you know, it's probably a better fit for me to go into the engineering side of things. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=248.0s)]
*  And you were at Texas Instruments, I think, in the TI 81 and TI 85 years. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=257.0s)]
*  Is that right? And did you work on those products? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=264.0s)]
*  I worked on digital signal processing chips. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=267.0s)]
*  And these were just summer internships, I guess. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=270.0s)]
*  And, you know, very much in keeping with what I was doing as an undergrad, which is really signal processing, which fundamentally is not that different from, you know, neuroscience. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=274.0s)]
*  Right. So this was electronic approaches to signal processing, the hardware associated with that. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=284.0s)]
*  Actually did some very early work on AI technologies. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=289.0s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't so much convolutional neural networks back then, but, you know, more linear based neural network technologies. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=294.0s)]
*  These are really the very basics. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=304.0s)]
*  And so implementation of that on signal processing hardware as well. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=306.0s)]
*  That was at Texas Instruments? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=310.0s)]
*  No, that was actually as an undergrad. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=312.0s)]
*  Oh, as an undergrad. OK. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=314.0s)]
*  And then what kind of made you decide to apply engineering to brain science? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=316.0s)]
*  Go from electrical signaling to, I guess, a different kind of electrical signaling? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=322.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that was really it. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=326.0s)]
*  So all of my undergrad work was around biomedical applications, but it was pretty obvious there was a strong disconnect in the language that engineers use and physicians use or, you know, biological researchers use. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=328.0s)]
*  And it just seemed a very obvious niche for me to understand those two languages and kind of be able to work within that space and bridge that space. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=341.0s)]
*  And so that's where I went. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=350.0s)]
*  And again, I had this interest in neural networks and how neural networks in the brain process information and how that is distinct from how a computer and all the digital signal processing techniques I'd learned. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=352.0s)]
*  So that's what that's kind of what got me interested in the MD-PhD side of things. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=367.0s)]
*  Got it. Maybe we can talk about the formation of a TIDE next. Who was involved? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=373.0s)]
*  How did it come together? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=380.0s)]
*  So it actually preceded me by a little bit, right? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=382.0s)]
*  So there was it was in 2018 and it was Christian Aagermeier, Lars Vilda and Florian Brand. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=386.0s)]
*  Those those are the three and initially they kind of put it to the sort of started. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=393.0s)]
*  This all came about because there was a desire to fund Compass Pathways. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=398.0s)]
*  So this is in 2018. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=405.0s)]
*  It was very difficult for Compass to find funding as a developer of psychedelic therapies. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=407.0s)]
*  Christian was able to put money in and actually get some of his, you know, some of his friends to also put money in like Peter T. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=413.0s)]
*  So there was in this initial round of money that went into Compass and it was, you know, became evident to and then Lars actually went into Compass. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=422.0s)]
*  And so Florian stayed with what ultimately ended up becoming a TIDE. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=432.0s)]
*  And, you know, essentially then it was there's lots of other things that could be, you know, this company that we could fund. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=437.0s)]
*  There's other psychedelic compounds, there's other compounds. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=444.0s)]
*  And so that's where a TIDE sort of started. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=447.0s)]
*  And so that's where a TIDE sort of started and TIDE, all of Christian's shares in Compass were put into a TIDE. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=449.0s)]
*  And so then it was more like a family office for Christian for a period of time. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=456.0s)]
*  But over the course of 2019, there was a desire to potentially shift it in a slightly different direction. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=462.0s)]
*  Look, you know, look broader than simply psychedelics. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=469.0s)]
*  In fact, the second investment was a company called Perception Neuroscience. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=472.0s)]
*  And that was ostensibly a non psychedelic, non dissociative version of ketamine. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=476.0s)]
*  So something that could be taken at home as an example. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=481.0s)]
*  So that's actually how I got involved with with the TIDE because the co-founder of Perception was actually my very first boss in the industry, a guy named Jay Kranzler. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=485.0s)]
*  Oh, interesting. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=497.0s)]
*  Yeah. So that's how I got introduced. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=498.0s)]
*  And, you know, the initial idea was for me to take the helm at Perception. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=500.0s)]
*  But in having discussions with the with the TIDE and the folks that I mentioned, you know, there was an opportunity for a TIDE to go into a very different direction, which is really an operating company and kind of pursue this hub and spoke model. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=505.0s)]
*  And that's when I made more sense for me to join the TIDE level and really build up that capability. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=521.0s)]
*  So Lars, Christian, Florian did not have a biotech background. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=528.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, Christian, he certainly had a background in biotech investing. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=533.0s)]
*  But of course, that's different than operating a company. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=537.0s)]
*  So that's what I came on board to do to really build up that capability, which, you know, I came on board in January 2019 and of course, did exactly that. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=539.0s)]
*  And built up the team internally, started to work on some of the internally developed assets, including VLS01 shortly thereafter. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=550.0s)]
*  And also continued this model of finding cool assets that are outside and investing in them. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=559.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what we did over the course of 2019, 20 and 21. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=567.0s)]
*  I want to ask about the hub and spoke model of a TIDE. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=573.0s)]
*  But before that, you mentioned investing early in Compass Pathways, one of the earliest, I think, psychedelic companies, perhaps aside from MAPS, who's developing their MDMA candidate. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=576.0s)]
*  Compass developing, I think, their lead candidate is a synthetic psilocybin candidate. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=588.0s)]
*  What? And you mentioned, you know, that investment was tough. Finding investors. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=595.0s)]
*  Obviously, there were some kind of hope high profile investors. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=601.0s)]
*  Peter Thiel, you mentioned. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=604.0s)]
*  What what could you say about the investment landscape then versus now? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=606.0s)]
*  We're going to talk a little bit about MAPS in a minute and what happened with them. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=613.0s)]
*  But I guess in terms of how the investment area has changed since since you've been involved in psychedelic drug development. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=617.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's been a bit of a roller coaster. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=626.0s)]
*  So 2018 was really characterized by complete pessimism on the space and just really thinking of it as kind of a crazy idea. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=628.0s)]
*  Right. So why would you do psychedelic? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=636.0s)]
*  You know, what's the benefit? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=639.0s)]
*  And is this even a thing with the agency? [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=641.0s)]
*  I think what helped catalyze things to some degree was actually approval in early 2019 Espravado, which is a, you know, our eschatamine, which is a psychedelic adjacent molecule, if you will. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=644.0s)]
*  So that really helped catalyze things. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=657.0s)]
*  2019 and 20 and 21, you know, of course, were where there was a lot of investment. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=660.0s)]
*  You know, interestingly, with Kobe, of course, there was a lot of money that went into the stock market. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=667.0s)]
*  There was a lot more speculative bets that were placed, you know, broadly speaking, neurosciences consider a speculative bet and certainly psychedelics within it was, you know, psychedelic. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=672.0s)]
*  It was speculative squared in some sense. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=681.0s)]
*  Lots of money went into that space. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=684.0s)]
*  Tons, lots of smaller companies were created then. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=687.0s)]
*  And then, you know, after 21, there was a bit of a winter in biotech. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=691.0s)]
*  And in fact, the latter part of 21 is when things turned. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=695.0s)]
*  And that's been pretty much how it's been for some time. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=699.0s)]
*  You know, certainly as results came out, there was the ability to invest, but it's been a bit more of a challenging time. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=705.0s)]
*  And I think Compass struggled with that, too, with their phase two results. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=710.0s)]
*  I mean, there was a lot of run up on their stock going into that result or preceding that result. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=714.0s)]
*  But once the results came, it was really, you know, stock price went down pretty significantly. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=720.0s)]
*  So it was it's been a bit of a challenging time. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=724.0s)]
*  That's not to say that good assets have not been able to get invested in because they certainly have early this year. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=727.0s)]
*  Well, I think post-selection and early this year, things were considered a bit more positive. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=734.0s)]
*  There was a lot of you know, there was a bit of a Trump bump, et cetera, in terms of general monetary policy, you know, cutting taxes, et cetera, potentially leading to more investment. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=740.0s)]
*  And then there was also the whole thing about RFK who has been said to have a more positive stance on psychedelics. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=751.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, that was I don't know where that's all netting out now. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=760.0s)]
*  I mean, there's been a lot of a lot of turmoil that, you know, that is obvious at the federal level and how that's going to impact things. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=765.0s)]
*  I know that, for example, you know, with you know, we just announced that our BLS01 trial, we did the phase two trial. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=773.0s)]
*  We just had a you know, just those first patient. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=780.0s)]
*  What has been apparent in talking to investigators is that, you know, there's been a lot of challenges with getting DEA licensing because of all the turmoil at the agency. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=784.0s)]
*  I don't know at this point. I mean, it's just we just need to let some of this settle out, I think. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=794.0s)]
*  Right. And that's that's DEA Drug Enforcement Agency, which you need approval from in order to conduct clinical trials on on these kinds of substances. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=799.0s)]
*  Just one I have one more question just about your your background, Dr. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=810.0s)]
*  Raoul, I'm curious about if there were learnings that you were able to bring from past non psychedelic experiences at companies like Cyprus Biosciences. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=814.0s)]
*  We mentioned Kylan. You worked at at retrofren retrofin at axial biotherapeutics. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=824.0s)]
*  Others were there specific learnings or insights that that that you picked up at those companies that help inform the therapeutic strategy at a tie? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=832.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think, well, there's a couple of things. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=844.0s)]
*  There's many things, actually, you know, all of those, including depo med, by the way, depo med to write. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=847.0s)]
*  I mean, essentially, neuroscience certainly and mental health adjacent in many ways. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=853.0s)]
*  So particularly if you start counting things like chronic pain, which has a huge affective element. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=858.0s)]
*  More importantly, the general strategy for clinical trials is pretty simple. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=863.0s)]
*  I said similar, I should say, you know, they're all using patient reported outcomes. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=867.0s)]
*  You can't ask a you can't measure objectively someone's pain level. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=871.0s)]
*  You've got to ask it. You can't ask. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=876.0s)]
*  You know, there's no biomarker for autism. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=880.0s)]
*  Really, you have to ask the patient how their socialization is and our caregivers, et cetera. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=882.0s)]
*  So the trials in many ways are similar across all of those indications. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=887.0s)]
*  But I think the most important element for me has always been starting with the end in mind, right? [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=892.0s)]
*  Starting with, you know, taking a physician's perspective like what are we trying to accomplish? [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=897.0s)]
*  What is it that's going to you know, what's the gap that we're trying to fill the unmet need? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=903.0s)]
*  But really keeping the patient and the physician perspective in mind and thinking about commercialization from the get go. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=909.0s)]
*  That is actually why the also one is the way it is. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=915.0s)]
*  It was a decision early on to say, you know, there are challenges with a very long psychedelic experience. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=919.0s)]
*  It demands new infrastructure, at least adaptation of existing infrastructure. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=926.0s)]
*  So let's try and take something that we believed would be fully flushed out by the time we were ready. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=930.0s)]
*  And that was, you know, the J&J infrastructure. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=937.0s)]
*  If anybody can put together an infrastructure, it is J&J, right? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=940.0s)]
*  They've got the muscle to do that. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=943.0s)]
*  And, you know, Sprovato launched into a tough time. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=945.0s)]
*  They got approval in 2019, as I mentioned, but of course, got hit with COVID shortly thereafter. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=950.0s)]
*  And this is an in clinic kind of therapy. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=954.0s)]
*  So they had a very rough few years, but they cracked the code, as you'd anticipate a company like J&J would. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=957.0s)]
*  They were able to turn it around, understand what reimbursement looks like, put together the appropriate cookbook for the sites to be able to deliver this therapy and deliver it in a manner that's cost effective for them. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=963.0s)]
*  I mean, if they're, you know, the sites are not making money, you know, the clinical sites, the doctor's offices, then it's not going to work. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=978.0s)]
*  But they were able to crack that code. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=986.0s)]
*  And, you know, they hit, they went over a billion dollars last year. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=988.0s)]
*  930 million of that was roughly 930 million of that was in the U.S. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=992.0s)]
*  And it was about 50,000 patients, give or take. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=998.0s)]
*  So if you think about that for a second, 50,000 patients out of roughly 3 million or so with treatment resistant depression. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1001.0s)]
*  So, you know, I think there's lots of avenues here. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1009.0s)]
*  But again, it was always around keeping the end goal in mind. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1011.0s)]
*  And, you know, we made a bet on Spravato and Spravato infrastructure. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1015.0s)]
*  And I think that's been born out. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1020.0s)]
*  Yeah. So it sounds like that approval and launch of Spravato was pretty important, perhaps not just to Ty, but a number of companies that are focused on this space. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1022.0s)]
*  Is that fair to say? [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1033.0s)]
*  Yeah, I would say so. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1035.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1037.0s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1039.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just going to say that, of course, the Lycos thing was the opposite in some ways, right? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1040.0s)]
*  That really caused a lot of that did cause a marked pullback in space last year. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1044.0s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's talk a little bit about that. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1050.0s)]
*  Since you bring it up, MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies spun off a commercial organization called Lycos, which was created to essentially receive approval and commercialize their MDMA candidate for post-traumatic stress disorder. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1053.0s)]
*  I widely thought that it would be approved by FDA, including by me. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1076.0s)]
*  It didn't it didn't happen. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1082.0s)]
*  There was an advisory committee where some I think, at least from MAPS perspective, unexpected topics came up. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1084.0s)]
*  The advisory committee voted against approval. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1093.0s)]
*  The FDA followed that lead, didn't approve it, requested some additional trials, which has now led to some layoffs and reorganization at Lycos. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1097.0s)]
*  What went wrong there? [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1109.0s)]
*  I mean, there was it was hard to find anyone who said who didn't think that that product was going to be approved in August of what 2013? [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1111.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was one of those that wasn't quite so sure. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1121.0s)]
*  So this is one of those weird ones where, you know, generally speaking, at this point, when something is going, you know, when something has been submitted, I've you know, I have a pretty good sense of whether or not it's going to get approved. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1125.0s)]
*  I was not convinced of this one, but I also was just saying I really don't get it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1136.0s)]
*  I really can't put odds on this one. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1141.0s)]
*  Because there were weird political pressures that pushed it in one way. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1145.0s)]
*  But then there was a data package itself, even stuff that we knew about prior to the briefing book being released for the outcome that didn't make a lot of sense. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1148.0s)]
*  I didn't make a lot of friends at a conference about, I don't know, a year, year and a half ago when I said, I don't know if it's going to get approved. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1156.0s)]
*  I really don't have a sense of it. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1163.0s)]
*  So why did I say that? [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1165.0s)]
*  I mean, there's a couple of things. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1166.0s)]
*  First of all, the general premise didn't make sense to me that it was a drug that was assisting therapy because therapy isn't the purview of the agency. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1168.0s)]
*  That's kind of obvious. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1178.0s)]
*  Right. You can't say that as a label indication because that's not what the agency does. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1179.0s)]
*  Now, there are ways of sort of getting around this. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1184.0s)]
*  You can say, listen, we there are therapies that are standard of care for post traumatic stress disorder. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1188.0s)]
*  Right. This dialectical behavioral therapy, this exposure therapy is a few others. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1196.0s)]
*  So what we are going to do is get those patients that have PTSD. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1199.0s)]
*  We're going to bring them in. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1204.0s)]
*  We're going to start them on standard of care therapy. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1205.0s)]
*  One, just to make it simple. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1208.0s)]
*  And then we're going to give them MDMA or we're going to give them placebo. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1211.0s)]
*  Not a problem. That is a known that's a known modality. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1215.0s)]
*  Right. The FDA has done this with opioid use disorder drugs. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1218.0s)]
*  Right. You had their part of MAT, medically assisted therapy. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1221.0s)]
*  Totally cool. It's done with GOP wants. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1225.0s)]
*  GOP ones are supposed to be used in the context of, you know, other health interventions like, you know, eating as well as exercise, et cetera, to affect weight loss. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1230.0s)]
*  Right. The agency doesn't regulate those things. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1241.0s)]
*  It's fine. So there there is a path. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1245.0s)]
*  But, you know, they went off the reservation a little bit. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1248.0s)]
*  I mean, the therapy was nonstandard, completely nonstandard. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1251.0s)]
*  It was completely nonstandardized. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1254.0s)]
*  And then they had this whole notion that the therapist had to be in the room. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1256.0s)]
*  So there was therapist functional and blinding, which is totally new. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1260.0s)]
*  That's just not a thing that's ever been dealt with before. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1264.0s)]
*  So not only were they trying to get therapy approved, they wanted to get something that was nonstandard approved. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1266.0s)]
*  And then they were doing odd things like having the therapist in the room. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1272.0s)]
*  So then the therapist knows whether the patient got a drug or placebo and they will adapt. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1275.0s)]
*  Right. They will adapt how they approach the patient. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1282.0s)]
*  This is what the FDA was concerned about. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1285.0s)]
*  There was other stuff that came out during the once the briefing book was released and once the adcom itself was released. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1288.0s)]
*  But just the basic premise of the stuff that we knew about was problematic. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1294.0s)]
*  That's what gave me pause. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1299.0s)]
*  Oh, the final thing, of course, is just the size of the trials. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1301.0s)]
*  80 patients ish times two is just very small for a not orphan indication. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1304.0s)]
*  Let's just put it that way. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1313.0s)]
*  So, you know, PTSD is pretty common. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1314.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1317.0s)]
*  You would compare it to Compass. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1318.0s)]
*  That's a thousand patients compared to all the other companies out there. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1322.0s)]
*  I mean, no one's under no one is under 500 patients. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1326.0s)]
*  I believe. I mean, you can double check that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1330.0s)]
*  But, you know, that's a kind of a normal thing. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1332.0s)]
*  And the FDA, it just makes sense. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1334.0s)]
*  You know, you need to understand adverse events. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1337.0s)]
*  You can't go in with the premise saying this drug is obviously works and it's obviously safe. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1340.0s)]
*  You have to go and demonstrate efficacy. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1345.0s)]
*  You have to demonstrate the safety. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1347.0s)]
*  You need to understand adverse events that are occurring in one percent of patients or more resolution would be good. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1349.0s)]
*  But one percent demands that you do 300 patients on drug. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1356.0s)]
*  This is rough rubric, which is the three, you know, the three X role. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1360.0s)]
*  So you didn't get any of that here. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1364.0s)]
*  So I think it was one of the FDA reviewers or what, you know, was basically like obviously very politically savvy, but basically said, well, we did not put the label together. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1366.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1377.0s)]
*  We don't know the data. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1379.0s)]
*  We don't understand. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1381.0s)]
*  We don't understand the safety data that were concerns. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1382.0s)]
*  We don't understand it. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1385.0s)]
*  We don't understand the efficacy data. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1386.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1388.0s)]
*  And as you said, FDA doesn't regulate therapy. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1389.0s)]
*  And I'm sure there was the issue of having to tease out, you know, how much of therapy was contributing to the efficacy if they're paired paired together. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1393.0s)]
*  Do you I mean, do you think maps went in that direction because they needed that aspect to deliver the outcomes or it was just kind of a mistake? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1402.0s)]
*  They they just had very they had very fixed views on how things should happen. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1412.0s)]
*  And they I think they frankly over the years just they just went against the establishment. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1417.0s)]
*  That was kind of the thing. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1424.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1425.0s)]
*  And I think that's what caused some problems there. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1427.0s)]
*  There were there are pathways that make sense. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1431.0s)]
*  And I think those pathways are suitable for MDMA. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1434.0s)]
*  100 percent suitable, like the stuff I told you about. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1438.0s)]
*  But they chose to go in a different direction. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1441.0s)]
*  Right. Right. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1445.0s)]
*  Maps Lycos may have created some of their their own challenges, but there are certainly challenges that are unique to psychedelic drug development culturally, perhaps scientifically. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1448.0s)]
*  What can you say about those and maybe how a tie is thinking about overcoming those challenges? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1460.0s)]
*  I mean, from the outset, my view is this is just another class of compounds. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1466.0s)]
*  Right. This is just another class of drugs. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1470.0s)]
*  I was familiar with all of the ketamine work. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1472.0s)]
*  I mean, ketamine was quite groundbreaking because it did affect benefits immediately. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1475.0s)]
*  Right. And there was some persistence up to a week to two weeks. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1480.0s)]
*  So that was pretty cool. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1483.0s)]
*  This is sort of the next step of that, the next iteration. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1484.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1486.0s)]
*  And there was a lot of literature that supported that general motion, including small double line placebo control trials. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1487.0s)]
*  But to me, it was just another drug that, of course, isn't how these things are perceived externally. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1495.0s)]
*  Right. There's a lot of cultural overlay with these compounds, which I've always found interesting. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1500.0s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of discussions that these shouldn't be commercialized, blah, blah, blah. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1507.0s)]
*  OK. Again, I never focused on that personally. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1512.0s)]
*  It's just let's do the right studies to it. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1518.0s)]
*  The FDA has been very supportive of these compounds, I mean, all the way through with breakthrough designations and everything else. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1522.0s)]
*  They like it. They recognize the need in the space. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1529.0s)]
*  There's a known pathway. Just let's follow that. Let's go do it. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1532.0s)]
*  And let's generate the data that's needed. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1536.0s)]
*  Now, again, this is weird because this is one of the reasons that I ended up going and wanting to do discovery work very early on and finding new compounds. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1538.0s)]
*  Because again, there was this, to me, a surprising level of cultural overlay with DMT and with 5-Methoxy DMT and psilocybin. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1546.0s)]
*  It's like, OK, fine, let's just go create some new compounds so we can sidestep all of that stuff. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1556.0s)]
*  I think over time, that's gotten better, though. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1563.0s)]
*  I mean, there's certainly pockets and there's individuals that continue to believe that there's something above and beyond the chemical compound here. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1565.0s)]
*  And that's fine. You can believe whatever you want. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1575.0s)]
*  But there's certainly a much more mainstream kind of view, mainstream being in the sense of physicians, et cetera. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1577.0s)]
*  But yeah, these are interesting compounds or powerful compounds. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1584.0s)]
*  Pharmacology, to some degree, is understood. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1588.0s)]
*  I mean, at least these would be the 5-HT2A receptor. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1590.0s)]
*  So let's go do something with that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1593.0s)]
*  Are there any cultural issues you have to overcome just in terms of convincing some? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1596.0s)]
*  And of course, there are many physicians who understand it, see the data, get that it's a potential game changer in some mental health disorders. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1602.0s)]
*  But I'm sure that you also encounter physicians and patients that will hear psilocybin or ketamine or DMT or MDMA and think drug, illicit substance. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1613.0s)]
*  Do you encounter that physicians who are sort of less willing to refer a patient to a clinical trial or a treatment, naive patient who is concerned about going into a clinical trial on a substance like that that has something of a reputation? [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1628.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I think that on the physician side, it's a little harder to answer. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1645.0s)]
*  Right. Because I have a selection bias. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1649.0s)]
*  The people I speak to probably and the people are going into trials and everything else are more inclined to do that. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1651.0s)]
*  We have done some market research and certainly around MDMA itself. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1656.0s)]
*  There was some negative views because like this is a party drug and you know, why are we giving this to patients? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1660.0s)]
*  But that speaks more to market building and physician education to me than it does about the compounds themselves. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1666.0s)]
*  It's all about the data for me. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1674.0s)]
*  And I think a lot of doctors ultimately kind of fall into that same bucket. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1676.0s)]
*  I mean, sure, there'll be individuals that are relatively more dogmatic about it. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1680.0s)]
*  You know, someone that went through the 70s and had a very negative, you know, negative thoughts about how it was handled and how, you know, the leery and others kind of, you know, position that. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1685.0s)]
*  I mean, sure, there'll be those individuals and patients also. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1702.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, we are going for psychedelic, naive patients. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1705.0s)]
*  We do not want patients that have a lot of experience because that has problems with the trial, which was something else that came up. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1709.0s)]
*  But with Lycos, by the way, they had like 40 percent of patients that had taken MDMA before. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1715.0s)]
*  So they had kind of a sense of whether or not they were getting placebo. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1719.0s)]
*  So we want naive individuals. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1722.0s)]
*  And there is absolutely anxiety in many individuals going into it because it is such an unusual experience. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1724.0s)]
*  And there's fears that things can come up, et cetera. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1731.0s)]
*  And that's kind of what you're going for to some degree. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1734.0s)]
*  I mean, you know, at least that's one of the hypotheses that the benefit is coming from being able to process things that haven't been processed. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1736.0s)]
*  Again, that's a hypothesis and we don't have to flesh that out. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1743.0s)]
*  But, you know, so there's absolutely anxiety. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1746.0s)]
*  That's one of the other reasons I kind of like shorter duration compounds. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1749.0s)]
*  The first one, the first experience, you know, at least they get a sense of what that's like and they can maybe get another experience. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1753.0s)]
*  You know, it's a super long experience. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1760.0s)]
*  They can feel kind of, you know, that that can be even more daunting. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1763.0s)]
*  It's like, all right, well, it's only two hours, you know, right. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1766.0s)]
*  There are two hours like, oh, geez, it's eight, six hours, eight hours, ten hours. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1769.0s)]
*  That's a long time. I mean, just mentally kind of going into it. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1772.0s)]
*  Not to mention the infrastructure required physicians, you know, monitoring, et cetera, for that long of a period of time could get could get difficult. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1776.0s)]
*  I want to talk about a ties business model. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1786.0s)]
*  You have your own development candidates as well as strategic investments in other companies. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1788.0s)]
*  We mentioned Compass already, but Beckley SciTech, Recognify Life Sciences. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1794.0s)]
*  Am I saying that correctly? [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1801.0s)]
*  Recognify. Can you kind of outline and you mentioned hub and spoke model, but can you explain the thinking behind this business model? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1803.0s)]
*  Yeah, so we again, we had a more complex model for the most part when we started. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1812.0s)]
*  Right. So we were pretty open to all sorts of things, including incubated assets like our DMT one BLS01 as well as RMDMA EMP01. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1816.0s)]
*  But we also did invest in other companies and that could be a majority investment or minority. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1824.0s)]
*  We obviously had some public investments as well, including Compass. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1830.0s)]
*  So we were open to many different things. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1834.0s)]
*  We had a lot of assets that were in development, early development. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1836.0s)]
*  You know, the reality is that we had high bars for everything for moving an asset forward. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1840.0s)]
*  And there was a lot of organic sort of, you know, there's a lot of pruning for that reason. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1846.0s)]
*  And, you know, as we now advance into the later stage, the the the the resources demands become a lot higher. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1851.0s)]
*  So we certainly winnowed things down. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1859.0s)]
*  The primary focus for the most part is on our internal assets. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1862.0s)]
*  We did make an investment in Beckley in January of last year. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1866.0s)]
*  The reason being that we like the team, we like the company. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1870.0s)]
*  We have a close relationship. We've had a relationship with them for an extended period of time. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1874.0s)]
*  Philosophically, they're very much aligned with us with the short duration psychedelics. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1878.0s)]
*  So they had BPL03, which is 5 methoxy DMT. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1882.0s)]
*  It's distinct from DMT, which is what we're developing, pharmacologically distinct, but same to our paradigm. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1886.0s)]
*  So we were very much in alignment on that. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1892.0s)]
*  And these two assets are the furthest along in terms of short duration therapies by far. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1895.0s)]
*  Right. So these are both to our assets and kind of a single administration, very much just kind of drag and drop into Spravato paradigm, single administration, monitor the patient, see how they're doing and can send them home to ours plus after they get their dose. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1900.0s)]
*  So very simple. So that's why we made that investment. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1915.0s)]
*  Now, Recognify was an older one. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1919.0s)]
*  It is a it's non psychedelic actually. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1922.0s)]
*  It's for cognitive schizophrenia. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1924.0s)]
*  Very interesting compound with strong preclinical and clinical data actually for pro cognitive effects. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1927.0s)]
*  And the mechanism by which it has these effects was very much something that actually came back to my to my PhD work, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1934.0s)]
*  which is actually around working memory and schizophrenia lab. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1944.0s)]
*  So it's cognitive impairments and schizophrenia. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1947.0s)]
*  But there was a there was a lot of interesting stuff with the pharmacology of that drug that suggests that it could be very beneficial for this patient population. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1950.0s)]
*  The unmet medical need is enormous with cognitive impairment with schizophrenia, the cognitive impairments element. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1957.0s)]
*  So I just really believe in the indication, believe in helping those patients out. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1962.0s)]
*  Challenging indication without a doubt. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1967.0s)]
*  But yeah, there we are about 60 percent with Beckley. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1969.0s)]
*  We are about a third with Beckley. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1971.0s)]
*  We have some we have, you know, warrants that can take us closer to 50 percent. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1973.0s)]
*  We have a shareholder rights as well. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1978.0s)]
*  And, you know, generally speaking, we've had the idea was to have some, you know, depending on results, depending on where both companies were at, potentially bring the two companies together at some point. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1981.0s)]
*  Yeah, schizophrenia is a really interesting one. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1994.0s)]
*  And of course, there have been some some newly approved and exciting drugs in that space. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=1996.0s)]
*  You know, I've been covering schizophrenia off and on for a number of years. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2003.0s)]
*  And I remember, you know, like when a billify tried to do the, you know, the digital pill to solve the adherence issue, which didn't exactly work. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2007.0s)]
*  But but these drugs are new mechanisms, right? [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2016.0s)]
*  The potential to really make a change in that disease. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2019.0s)]
*  But, you know, there were a number of years where there just wasn't much in development for these patients. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2022.0s)]
*  And like you said, it's a it's a it's an unmet need, to say the least. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2029.0s)]
*  A tie, getting back to a tie life sciences, you experienced some disappointing clinical results in twenty twenty three with PCN 101 led to some layoffs, a refocusing of the pipeline. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2035.0s)]
*  How has well, let me ask this. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2052.0s)]
*  How has a tie changed since its inception, since you started in 2018? [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2054.0s)]
*  Yeah, so well, you know, just answer the first thing first. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2061.0s)]
*  Negative results are part and parcel of this this industry. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2065.0s)]
*  Absolutely. If you knew the answers before going into the trial, then you don't need to do the trial. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2069.0s)]
*  Fundamentally, right. Right. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2074.0s)]
*  So that's part and parcel. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2076.0s)]
*  I mean, as I mentioned, there's been a simplifying of the model. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2078.0s)]
*  Right. That's what we certainly what I've been going for to keep the team more focused on a smaller number of assets, but really going all in. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2083.0s)]
*  And part of that is understandable because we did run many, many clinical trials across a number of assets. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2092.0s)]
*  I mean, from KUR 101 to GABA's GRX 917 to, of course, the multiple phase ones with PCN 101 and the phase two as well. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2099.0s)]
*  So we ran a lot of studies and we had high bars for going to the next step. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2109.0s)]
*  And many just didn't make it. And that is OK. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2114.0s)]
*  That is how this that's how this process works. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2117.0s)]
*  Yeah. And yeah, sorry. Go ahead. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2121.0s)]
*  No. So just again, just kind of simplifying a lot. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2123.0s)]
*  The company is much more lean and mean at this point and really targeting the things that matter to us right now. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2126.0s)]
*  Right. How do you and as you say, you know, this. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2134.0s)]
*  Everybody has a disappointing clinical results. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2138.0s)]
*  Something doesn't go exactly as as hoped or planned. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2141.0s)]
*  How do you recover? You know, how do you kind of take that in and and move forward the next day after you get, you know, a data read like that? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2145.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think this is one of those things where experience is really helpful. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2153.0s)]
*  Right. You you there's always I mean, I never say we understand that. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2156.0s)]
*  I never say that there's yeah, this is a slam dunk. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2164.0s)]
*  Right. That's just not the language I will use. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2167.0s)]
*  I think that you always learn something. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2170.0s)]
*  It's always massively disappointing that day. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2174.0s)]
*  And, you know, the next day you kind of pick it up and take it from there. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2177.0s)]
*  Like, what did we learn out of this? You know, you do pre-mortems and pre-mortems. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2181.0s)]
*  You also do post-mortems like what could have gone better? [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2184.0s)]
*  What are some ideas that, you know, we spend a lot of time with a PC and one on one readout, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2187.0s)]
*  analyzing the data and cutting the data in many, many different ways to try and understand what happened, what could have happened there. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2191.0s)]
*  What could we have done differently? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2197.0s)]
*  And, you know, that's again, that's just how it that's just the nature of the beast. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2199.0s)]
*  That's the way it goes. That's right. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2204.0s)]
*  What are your key priorities and upcoming milestones that you're most focused on right now? [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2206.0s)]
*  Yeah, we have a really exciting roughly 12 months or so, 12 to, you know, 12 to 15 months. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2215.0s)]
*  Actually, it's about 12 months at this point. We're in March. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2221.0s)]
*  So we have four phase two readouts coming up. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2224.0s)]
*  So BPL03, the Beckley Asset, again, the company where we are on about a third of the third, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2227.0s)]
*  it will be reading out with a phase two in the middle of this year. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2233.0s)]
*  In fact, we had a press release recently indicating the last patient had been dosed. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2237.0s)]
*  Recognify the cognitive impairment schizophrenia trial will also be reading out in the middle of this year. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2243.0s)]
*  In fact, that trial and the BPL03 trial are kind of on top of each other at the moment in terms of which we'll read out first. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2249.0s)]
*  We also want the internal DMT asset will be reading out in approximately a year within approximately a year for the treatment resistant depression study. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2256.0s)]
*  And then we have another asset, EMP01, which is our MDMA. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2265.0s)]
*  So single enantiomer of MDMA, which are developing for social anxiety disorder. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2268.0s)]
*  It's an earlier stage trial. So it's a phase two A proof of concept trial. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2273.0s)]
*  So that also is anticipated read out in approximately a year. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2277.0s)]
*  OK. And where does Compass stand right now? I think they they had delayed a full read out on their phase two program. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2282.0s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong about that. But what's next for them? [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2290.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it wasn't quite that they delayed. It's just that they're waiting until the trial is completed. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2294.0s)]
*  So their trial have six weekend points or two phase three, the two core phase three trials have six week endpoints. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2299.0s)]
*  But then they have a blinded observation window that goes out to six months. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2306.0s)]
*  So the challenge there is that if you want to read out from the primary, it is an interim analysis, essentially. Right. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2310.0s)]
*  So you can wait until all those patients are in. You can do an interim analysis. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2316.0s)]
*  There are concerns sometimes about what many times about disclosing efficacy results from an interim analysis because there's a you know, there's a there's a recognition that can impact the rest of the trial that's currently so. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2320.0s)]
*  I see. That's the challenge that they kind of went came up against. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2334.0s)]
*  And so what they have guided. So in the end, I don't know that. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2337.0s)]
*  I mean, there were some delays. Don't get me wrong. But I don't think they were quite as egregious as people may have thought. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2341.0s)]
*  Their first phase three, the so-called O five trial, their interim read on the primary analysis is middle of this year. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2348.0s)]
*  Apparently, it's a somewhat limited data set for the reason I just said, because the trial is still ongoing. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2356.0s)]
*  The full readout is, I believe, at the end of this year. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2361.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if they guide it differently, but I'm pretty sure it's at the end of this year. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2364.0s)]
*  So around the end, let's call it for the second trial, the six trial. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2367.0s)]
*  They are, I believe, going to give the full data readout in the middle of next year. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2372.0s)]
*  So I think that's where that's their current guidance. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2379.0s)]
*  And once those two are brought out, there's obviously some open label work that's also continuing. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2383.0s)]
*  You know, the trials where you kind of roll into from the the trial that you roll into from these trials. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2389.0s)]
*  So, yeah, that's kind of their timeline now. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2396.0s)]
*  So, you know, getting all these wrapped up and kind of the middle of twenty six, you know, potential for approval sometime in twenty seven, essentially. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2398.0s)]
*  It's point announcing efficacy data on an interim basis. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2406.0s)]
*  Does that have more of an impact if your endpoints are not tied to an objective biomarker? [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2411.0s)]
*  If it's getting back to what you were saying about the difficulty in a number of CNS areas, having a more subjective kind of patient reported outcome? [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2417.0s)]
*  Or does that happen with efficacy data revealed, you know, in other, you know, much more specific biomarker type disease areas? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2426.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have to admit, I have much less experience with things like cancer and other indications like that, where there's obviously, for better or worse, very objective endpoints, right? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2436.0s)]
*  Tumor free survival and just survival in general. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2447.0s)]
*  So as a general statement, it's not considered great to reveal data, efficacy data prior to the completion of a trial. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2452.0s)]
*  But there may be exceptions for things like that. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2460.0s)]
*  And certainly with orphan indications where even open label can be acceptable. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2463.0s)]
*  I mean, even in some cancer indications, there's if you have a very good sense of the natural history of a compound, at some point it becomes unethical to give a drug in a placebo controlled study. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2467.0s)]
*  Even though that's on top of standard of care. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2480.0s)]
*  I mean, if you've got a pretty good sense that you're saving lives at some point, it's like, yeah, well, you can't give them placebo anymore. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2482.0s)]
*  So there's a lot more latitude in that context. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2488.0s)]
*  Right. Do you and it's it's interesting you say for better or worse, because I think about this, too, with biomarkers, because you hear about disease states where, you know, you show, for example, a tumor has shrunk a certain amount. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2492.0s)]
*  The patient may not necessarily feel any better or may even even feel worse. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2506.0s)]
*  So there I think there are pros and cons with a strict objective biomarker versus a more subjective biomarker. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2511.0s)]
*  But my question for you, Dr. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2518.0s)]
*  Rowe, is do you think that we're anywhere close to getting to a biomarker in some of these mental health disease, whether it's imaging or something else? [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2520.0s)]
*  And and how helpful would that be if you were able to kind of hang your hat on a biomarker in, you know, depression, for example? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2530.0s)]
*  Oh, man, it would be unbelievably helpful if we could do it. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2539.0s)]
*  I think it's it's been one of those areas. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2542.0s)]
*  It's been very fraught. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2544.0s)]
*  People have been trying to do this for a long time, whether it's EG or imaging, et cetera. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2545.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm always interested in it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2550.0s)]
*  One of the things that's always intrigued me about psychedelics in particular is this notion that they can help with ruminative thoughts. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2554.0s)]
*  Right. And that's been something that, you know, the data has been sort of it's not the highest quality in some sense. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2563.0s)]
*  You know, but a lot of imaging studies have suggested that the default mode network and things like that, that you can see some persistent changes in that. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2569.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that I'd love to explore further. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2579.0s)]
*  It's not a regulatory endpoint to actually validate something like that, which would be considered a target endpoint would take a lot. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2582.0s)]
*  But of course, it markedly simplifies things if something like that can actually work. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2589.0s)]
*  Right. Several companies now. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2594.0s)]
*  David Olson at Delix is one example that comes to mind or working on psychedelics that have been used in the past. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2598.0s)]
*  The mind or working on psychedelics that have been engineered to remove the hallucinatory aspect, the trip, so to speak. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2605.0s)]
*  What's your opinion, Dr. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2614.0s)]
*  Rao, on whether the trip or an altered state of consciousness is needed to deliver the therapeutic outcome? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2617.0s)]
*  So my conceptualization of it is that these compounds are sort of doing two things. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2625.0s)]
*  The first is that they are causing a network disruption and then that network disruption is manifest as a psychedelic effect. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2632.0s)]
*  Right. And the second thing they're doing is causing marked neuroplasticity. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2642.0s)]
*  So what how I view it is that you've got this frozen snow globe that's got patterns in it that are not good, right, that are essentially, you know, bad for the patient. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2647.0s)]
*  The psychedelic is doing two things. It's thawing it out and then it's shaking it up. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2661.0s)]
*  And then obviously, as the drug wears off, it refreezes. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2665.0s)]
*  And it's got a new configuration then. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2668.0s)]
*  And for a rain for reasons due to regis specificity, you know, again, talking about some of these networks that seem to change their their dynamics and their activity, it's a more helpful configuration that they freeze back into. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2671.0s)]
*  So in that conceptualization, having something that's not psychedelic isn't necessarily helpful on its own. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2685.0s)]
*  Right. That's a theory, of course. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2693.0s)]
*  And we don't have data to support it or disprove it at the moment. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2697.0s)]
*  So I know that Delix, I think they push their timelines back. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2701.0s)]
*  I mean, I know that they're working on a phase two. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2705.0s)]
*  So that's going to be very telling. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2707.0s)]
*  I think there is avenue. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2709.0s)]
*  There are some useful avenues for non psychedelic compounds, and that is to put in conjunction with therapy. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2710.0s)]
*  So if you you can affect network disruption in many different ways, one of those is therapy. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2716.0s)]
*  That's fundamentally what you're doing. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2723.0s)]
*  Right. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a means of addressing negative thoughts. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2725.0s)]
*  That's kind of what I was getting at. Right. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2730.0s)]
*  So you could do it all at once with the psychedelic, but that's got psychedelic effect. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2732.0s)]
*  Or you could do it a bit more slowly over time, but maybe more constructively over time. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2735.0s)]
*  You know, who knows and allow it to cement in with these compounds. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2740.0s)]
*  Right. So the way I like to think about that is, you know, again, I mentioned I've done a lot of work in pain. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2746.0s)]
*  So if you break your leg or something, you're likely going to get physical therapy. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2752.0s)]
*  Right. Once the cast comes off or once, you know, once the brace comes off, you can get the most out of that therapy. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2756.0s)]
*  If you take a ton of NSA, it's prior to going into therapy because it allows you to create a range of motion. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2764.0s)]
*  It allows you to really exercise the joint. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2769.0s)]
*  So that's how I think of these non psychedelics. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2772.0s)]
*  And again, it's all a theory at the moment. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2775.0s)]
*  I don't have any data to support that. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2777.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's we've been working on non hallucinogenic, computerly non hallucinogenic compounds as well. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2779.0s)]
*  So we're intrigued by the space and could be completely wrong. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2786.0s)]
*  Maybe they do something completely on their own and that's totally cool. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2792.0s)]
*  And that'll be interesting. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2795.0s)]
*  I'm a little suspicious that and, you know, we have really done the team at a time has done a fantastic job of elucidating how this biased agonism is working. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2797.0s)]
*  We've got a very good sense of that and how the second messenger systems are working to affect psychedelic effects or neuroplastic effects. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2808.0s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, I I'm intrigued by this. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2818.0s)]
*  Let's see how it all plays out. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2821.0s)]
*  I mean, there will be some dynamic. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2822.0s)]
*  You know, I have a hard time believing there are no perceptual effects. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2825.0s)]
*  To be honest, but it might not rise to the full level of psychedelic effects and maybe something that's reasonably well tolerated even in an outpatient setting. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2830.0s)]
*  But all of this is TBD. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2840.0s)]
*  A ties products, assuming they go forward and are eventually approved. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2843.0s)]
*  Will they be administered? [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2848.0s)]
*  Not not in concert with therapy in a sense that therapy is in the label the way that it was with Lycosis MDMA product. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2850.0s)]
*  But will there be a kind of, you know, a strong recommendation or how does that work in terms of or I guess how do you think about it for let's use depression or anxiety as an example? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2858.0s)]
*  Will you know, will there be a therapy component to administering the drug? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2871.0s)]
*  No, we don't have any therapy component in our administration. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2876.0s)]
*  So, in fact, reveal also one, it's pretty limited at the amount of therapists interactions. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2879.0s)]
*  It's an hour prior to dosing. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2885.0s)]
*  So there's a one hour. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2888.0s)]
*  It's I think that one is an actual visit prior to dosing. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2889.0s)]
*  It's really to help prepare the patient. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2892.0s)]
*  Right. So essentially, to some degree, what is manifesting during the psychedelic experience is what you are kind of thinking about. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2895.0s)]
*  What's, you know, there's a suggestibility element to it. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2902.0s)]
*  So if you are thinking about the things that are bothering you, like what is it you want to change, you know, et cetera, some form of intention setting could be helpful. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2905.0s)]
*  At least that's that's speculated at this point. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2915.0s)]
*  So we do some of that, but we also have a big part of it is just giving as ensuring psychological safety. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2919.0s)]
*  So what can we do to make sure that, you know, if you're really struggling, you know, we can teach you box breathing. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2925.0s)]
*  So that's a nice, easy way of kind of settling yourself down. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2931.0s)]
*  So we want to make sure that you've got some experience with that going before going into it. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2935.0s)]
*  We have a one hour session afterwards. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2939.0s)]
*  It's strictly psychological safety. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2941.0s)]
*  As I mentioned, things can come up where this is a well-known phenomenon. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2943.0s)]
*  Right. So some history of abuse, some history of trauma can come up or some memories of that can come up. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2947.0s)]
*  We want to make sure that the patient is psychologically stable. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2953.0s)]
*  And it's kind of like if you had chest pain during administration of these compounds, ketamine or anything else, you want to make sure the patient you flag that you want to make sure the patient is medically stable. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2957.0s)]
*  So you'd have a cardiology consult potentially here. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2968.0s)]
*  It's the same kind of thing. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2971.0s)]
*  If something came up, you want to make sure that the patient has support as they kind of figure that out. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2973.0s)]
*  So you'd want to refer them to a therapist in that context. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2979.0s)]
*  But there's no specific therapy that's outlined for this. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2982.0s)]
*  And then is there a therapist or a physician that will be monitoring, I guess, during the session similar to I think the way it's done with Spravato? [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2985.0s)]
*  I want to say it's up to five hours, but maybe it's less than that. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2995.0s)]
*  Two hours. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=2999.0s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, absolutely. The patient needs to be monitored. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3001.0s)]
*  I mean, if you look at the so the FDA provided some guidance, right, some draft guidance around psychedelic therapies. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3003.0s)]
*  And they said that they need two people to monitor these patients, which I think has a lot to do with the fact that what they had been what was front of mind for the agency at that time was MDMA through Lycos as well as Compass. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3009.0s)]
*  And both of these are the Comp316. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3023.0s)]
*  Both of these are long duration. [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3025.0s)]
*  So I think a lot of it came from that with these short duration compounds. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3027.0s)]
*  You know what we have currently is someone in the room with the patient, not therapeutic, but just monitoring for safety and just making sure nothing untoward is happening. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3031.0s)]
*  And then we have someone else is monitoring through a camera. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3041.0s)]
*  And that's what we have. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3044.0s)]
*  Hopefully over time, it can be more like Spravato where there's only someone that's monitoring through the camera. [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3046.0s)]
*  Basic telemetry, making sure the blood pressure and pulse are not, you know, doing anything crazy and then just making sure that the patient is, you know, is doing their thing but isn't bouncing off the walls. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3052.0s)]
*  Right. That's what I need some intervention. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3066.0s)]
*  Are there any standardized settings type of like music playing or anything like that in the trials? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3069.0s)]
*  Or do you anticipate that being used in practice? [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3077.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3079.0s)]
*  I mean, people do use that obviously for all of these things. [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3081.0s)]
*  We have, you know, we have the mask on because you tend to have more intense visuals, etc. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3086.0s)]
*  If you have a mask on, you're not looking around and then we do have music as well. [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3091.0s)]
*  But the role of that music is not clear yet. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3095.0s)]
*  It's yet another variable at some point needs to get isolated and understood. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3098.0s)]
*  But right now there's no data that one way or another. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3104.0s)]
*  You don't want something that, you know, you're probably not going to listen to death metal on these compounds. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3107.0s)]
*  But, you know, something that's generally coming is probably is probably not unreasonable. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3111.0s)]
*  Right. And you anticipate having a REMS program similar to Spravato that will kind of guide all of those practices during the administration as well, right? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3116.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3128.0s)]
*  All right. Final, final question for you, Dr. Rao. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3130.0s)]
*  What impact do you think psychedelic therapy could ultimately have on mental health globally? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3134.0s)]
*  I mean, I think it's it has the potential to have a massive impact, right? [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3142.0s)]
*  This is just, again, it's a marked shift in paradigm. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3146.0s)]
*  As ketamine was the first one, it's rapid resolution symptoms, but it's a lot of administrations, right? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3150.0s)]
*  That's the challenge with Spravato. You're going in twice a week for four weeks, once a week for the subsequent four weeks. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3156.0s)]
*  It's many hours out of your week. You can't drive home. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3161.0s)]
*  You're you're you're kind of down for the count for that that day. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3165.0s)]
*  This could potentially allow one or two administrations over the course of, say, four to eight weeks. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3168.0s)]
*  That's just a big shift that can then get someone into remission, get many more people into remission. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3175.0s)]
*  Having it approved, having it standardized allows for reimbursement. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3181.0s)]
*  So many more people can benefit from in the United States. That's true elsewhere as well. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3185.0s)]
*  You you're certainly welcome to take these compounds, you know, particularly mantis mushrooms and other compounds, but our other materials, of course, that's not controlled. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3190.0s)]
*  You have no idea what you're getting. And it's expensive, at least in the United States. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3200.0s)]
*  You know, usually these are these sort of ceremonies and things are on the order of several thousand dollars. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3203.0s)]
*  So there's a very limited number of people that can that can benefit from just kind of like ketamine, right? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3208.0s)]
*  Ketamine typically is around five hundred dollars a pop if you're doing it and it's out of pocket as opposed to Spravato, where it's really your copay or deductible, which is typically substantially less. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3213.0s)]
*  So it's just a it's a different paradigm. It could help a lot of people just from that perspective. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3224.0s)]
*  And that's you know, that's again what we're doing. And once there's approval in the US and Europe, I mean, there's tends to be more. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3231.0s)]
*  It opens the floodgates to approvals in many other countries, many other territories. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3237.0s)]
*  And you're not on medical need, right? This is one of the greatest causes of disability in the world. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3241.0s)]
*  Right. Fifty percent of people will have some kind of an affective disorder over the course of their life. It's big. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4w32SueAzo&t=3248.0s)]
