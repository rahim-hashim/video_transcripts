Video Description: When the pandemic hit, Solis Biodyne found its manufacturing capacity stretched to the limit. In short order, it doubled, and then tripled, its manufacturing capacity. Then it doubled, and then tripled, its workforce. Meanwhile, it adopted a host of new platforms to serve the demand of its clients. Drs. Kadri Artma and Angela Vaasa join this episode of the Business of Biotech to take us behind the scenes and tell us the scale up story that's allowing the renowned producer of reagents to the life sciences industry to meet market demands.

# A Scale-Up Story With Solis BioDyne Drs. Kadri Artma and Angela Vaasa
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [June 29, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders)
*  This is the Business of Biotech and I'm Matt Piller and I thank you for tuning in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=0.0s)]
*  On today's show, we're taking a bit of a departure in that my guests are not the leaders [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=11.28s)]
*  of an emerging biopharma company, but rather the head of the supervisory board and chair [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=15.36s)]
*  of the council and COO at Solus Bio9, the well-known supplier of DNA polymerases, PCR [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=20.34s)]
*  master mixes, QPCR mixes and reverse transcription reagents to the biopharma industry. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=28.12s)]
*  So why the change up in this lineup, you might ask? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=34.84s)]
*  Well, Solus Bio9 is a company that's really flexed its scallop muscle in incredible fashion [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=37.52s)]
*  in this day and age of the pandemic. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=43.32s)]
*  And as such, the company has some unique experience to share with you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=46.2s)]
*  And perhaps no one is more qualified to share that experience than Kadri Artma, who has [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=50.16s)]
*  the past 21 years progressed from development manager to CEO to chairwoman of the council [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=56.260000000000005s)]
*  at Solus Bio9. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=63.620000000000005s)]
*  And as such, she's seen it all from the inside out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=65.3s)]
*  Joining her on today's show is Angela Vasa, COO at Solus Bio9. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=68.86s)]
*  So joining us all the way from the Tartu Science Park in Tartu, Estonia, while I join you from [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=74.14s)]
*  my dining room here in Pennsylvania, are Kadri and Angela. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=80.42s)]
*  Kadri and Angela, welcome to the show. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=84.9s)]
*  Hi, I'm very grateful to be with you and talk to you and also very happy about this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=87.62s)]
*  experience myself also. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=97.26s)]
*  And I am happy that Angela had such an experience and brought this good experience to our [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=98.7s)]
*  company with Zytiva and with Testa Center. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=104.54s)]
*  Yeah, I look forward to hearing more about that. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  And I'm grateful that you're both able to join us. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for putting some time aside for us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=114.38s)]
*  I know it's getting late in your day over there in Estonia, so I promise not to keep [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  you too long. But the first thing I want to do is get to know Solus Bio9 a little bit [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=121.38s)]
*  better. So if you could kind of frame up the company for us and maybe start by telling [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=126.74s)]
*  us who your customers are and what you sell to those customers. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=131.85999999999999s)]
*  So thank you. My name is Kadri Artma and I am at the moment really chairman of the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=136.94s)]
*  Council of Solus Bio9. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=141.38s)]
*  And I have been with my good business partner, Olep Kahre, who is the creator and founder [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=143.5s)]
*  of the company already 25 years. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  So we have really long experience in that what we are doing and what is doing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=153.46s)]
*  We are basically we our key competence is in molecular design and engineering. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=162.06s)]
*  And using and analyzing the patterns, gene patterns of the real nature and creating [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=170.9s)]
*  and developing from this these patterns, non-native polymerases making from those [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=179.34s)]
*  experiences and what we have seen. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=188.22s)]
*  And enzyme mixes, which are how we can say whole world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=191.1s)]
*  It is a combination of newly invented solutions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=199.14s)]
*  And this is not all actually. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=204.98s)]
*  On top of that, we can do customized solution. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=208.82s)]
*  And this we call at the moment our main focus to serve the clients in human diagnostics, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=213.62s)]
*  in other diagnostic sectors and also diagnostic manufacturers and of course, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=222.10000000000002s)]
*  academic and private research institutions. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=233.38000000000002s)]
*  And but of course, last year, this exceptional last year was and which is actually going [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=238.3s)]
*  on totally different conditions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=245.38000000000002s)]
*  We managed to serve our clients with our virus detection related products, one step [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=251.58s)]
*  RTQ PCR products, which were already ready and we had to adjust it very quickly. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=261.62s)]
*  But thanks to our very highly motivated and committed team, we were ready to do it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=270.74s)]
*  And what is very specific, our patented technology means this that our products all are [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=280.65999999999997s)]
*  room temperature stable. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=290.54s)]
*  So this is not only good for how to say greener logistics without dry ice packaging, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=292.62s)]
*  but it is convenient and simple and easy to use also in labs and in spots on spots and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=301.90000000000003s)]
*  to use it also already in the kits. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=309.26s)]
*  So the kits itself diagnostic kits can be room temperature stable. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  Excellent. Yeah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=319.41999999999996s)]
*  Our clients are all over the world because we don't have special region because our [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=324.94s)]
*  products are so easily transportable that we can deliver them all over the world. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=330.46s)]
*  So this is the and different applications, as I said at the moment, the main focus and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=337.38s)]
*  main direction is human diagnostics. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  But we are serving also in food detection, in again, different types of research, in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=346.74s)]
*  manufacturing services, in lab services, in medical centers and also up to, I don't [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=357.06s)]
*  know, environmental or agricultural breeding facilities. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=363.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=368.86s)]
*  I can imagine that that global capability has been very important over the course of [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=370.74s)]
*  the last 12 months. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=377.62s)]
*  And I want to get some sense for as we sort of set up the scallop conversation, I want [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=379.02000000000004s)]
*  to get a sense for the volume that that cellulose biodyne has been able to increase to here [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=384.86s)]
*  in the last 12 months. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=391.34000000000003s)]
*  So give us give us some insight into pre-pandemic, how many of these virus protection, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=392.42s)]
*  diagnostic kits were you putting together and shipping? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=399.34000000000003s)]
*  And then and then maybe contrast that with where we are now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=403.66s)]
*  Yes, it is hard to say because our production and offer was so variable. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=408.26s)]
*  But we can basically say that the number of tests or this direction, what we served, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=416.02s)]
*  basically increased 50 times. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=424.78000000000003s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=427.98s)]
*  Yeah. So so this was challenge and really, really a challenge, not because we had to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=428.98s)]
*  stay also safe and healthy and extraordinary situation. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=436.3s)]
*  So we were kind of I was thinking that in facing two challenges, how to produce this [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=442.46s)]
*  sector safely with very high quality, as we have the standard of medical device, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=450.62s)]
*  manufacturing, quality management standards with high quality standards, so very high [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=457.38s)]
*  volume. But at the same time, although it was like visible that one focus, one direction, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  what we saw and we found it out that still the clients were different. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=475.78s)]
*  They used different platforms. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=482.14s)]
*  They asked different questions. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=484.5s)]
*  So we had to adapt very well, the one direction, one focus. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=486.74s)]
*  We had to adapt very different platforms with our so to twice. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=492.06s)]
*  It was challengeable, very high volumes and at the same time, very diversity and big [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=497.54s)]
*  diversity of solutions. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  So so thanks to our really I'm very grateful to our team and also not [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=508.42s)]
*  only in lab, but also in in in sales, in product managers who are capable to talk to [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=516.42s)]
*  and understand the client needs. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=524.38s)]
*  The best also ask the help at how how to do the better cooperation so we can serve them. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=526.66s)]
*  But we ought to say we had to work in shifts. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=534.06s)]
*  We tripled basically our production team. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=540.5799999999999s)]
*  We doubled and even more our team as a whole. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=544.22s)]
*  And but due to our earlier very good instructions, descriptions of the work, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=549.66s)]
*  high standards in quality, we were adapting quite quickly. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=559.14s)]
*  But at the end of the year, then we understood that we must even raise more our [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=565.9s)]
*  knowledge, our experiences or more larger scale. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=571.98s)]
*  As you see, so now that we're in a period where, thankfully, it appears as though the [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=577.34s)]
*  pandemic is tamping down a bit, right, we're we're gaining some control. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=585.98s)]
*  As that progresses, as we return to some semblance of normalcy, what do you anticipate [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=593.62s)]
*  the business looking like moving forward? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=601.82s)]
*  Do you anticipate that you'll maintain that highly variable and large volume of business? [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=604.0600000000001s)]
*  Or do you see things kind of reeling, you know, kind of winding down a little bit? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=610.4200000000001s)]
*  So and so what we can say that I think that all countries or all states have seen these [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=616.34s)]
*  challenges and they are thinking more how to prevent also. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=625.26s)]
*  And they are maybe focusing more because, yes, this is not over yet, but still there are other [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=631.8199999999999s)]
*  viruses. I think there are more money is going to support such scientific directions, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=638.9s)]
*  which are also supporting human diagnostics, virus detections, all kind of. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=650.14s)]
*  So I think as we have the capacities higher and better now, we have more connections. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=654.66s)]
*  So I think that we can be better partners now in these levels also. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=663.86s)]
*  So human diagnostics is not ending, is growing, actually. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=672.3399999999999s)]
*  And just we can be more better. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=680.3s)]
*  And I really do hope that this pandemic is very soon over, because this is not the way how we [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=683.02s)]
*  would like to serve the world. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=690.6199999999999s)]
*  We would like to serve the world with more precise or more simple, with more convenient [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=692.42s)]
*  solutions. This is our our most biggest concern with high quality, high consistent quality. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=697.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, just so an aside there, I'm just curious, what's the pandemic situation in Tartu and [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=706.38s)]
*  Estonia right now? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=714.06s)]
*  At the moment, yes, it is not a place to smile at all, actually. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=718.02s)]
*  We have, I think, lived quite a normal life with less restrictions than the other parts of the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=723.9s)]
*  world. We would have had the chances to work. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=732.78s)]
*  Of course, there was also remote work. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=738.9399999999999s)]
*  People were also working at homes. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=742.6999999999999s)]
*  But still, we could, our children were capable to go to schools, at least partly. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=747.14s)]
*  But now at the moment, it's very, very bad situation. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=754.18s)]
*  So we must be very, very careful. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=757.5s)]
*  And again, they are closing now again their shops. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=759.9s)]
*  And I don't know what the wave is. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=765.06s)]
*  Is it third wave or is it fourth wave already? [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=767.46s)]
*  So at the moment, vaccines are coming very slowly. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=770.86s)]
*  So it is challenging at the moment. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=777.18s)]
*  Still some work to be done there. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=780.94s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I wish you both well, by the way. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=782.86s)]
*  And I hope you both stay healthy, you and your families. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=785.98s)]
*  So I want to dig into some of the behind the scenes of the scale up that you've experienced [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=789.82s)]
*  recently. I mean, those are incredible, incredible growth figures, you know, tripling your [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=796.22s)]
*  production team, doubling your overall team in a short period of time. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=800.66s)]
*  And I want to kind of dig into how you made that happen. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=804.62s)]
*  But let's start with the production scale. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=807.3000000000001s)]
*  What went into expanding your manufacturing scale? [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=810.14s)]
*  And I'd like you to tackle that from a new hires perspective, a space and equipment [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=816.1s)]
*  perspective. What sort of went into scaling up and from where to where have you gone in [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=821.98s)]
*  terms of your manufacturing volume and capacity? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=827.98s)]
*  Yes, at the moment. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=833.98s)]
*  It's a big, big open. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=836.3800000000001s)]
*  I asked you like five questions and one there. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=838.46s)]
*  So basically we foresee that, yes, at the moment we ordered already new equipment. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=840.86s)]
*  We are ordering new equipment and we are going to order new equipment. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=848.0600000000001s)]
*  This is basically to say we could just now I also give the word also to Angela. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=852.5s)]
*  Basically, we had a lower scale of the bioreactor at the moment. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=859.9000000000001s)]
*  We are definitely buying at the moment from, I don't know, 50 litre going to buy maybe [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=865.2199999999999s)]
*  not bigger scale. It can be also 200 litre bioreactor, etc. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=875.2199999999999s)]
*  But Angela is here to share the experience. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=880.6999999999999s)]
*  Actually, I can say that how it was possible, because in 2019 already the company owners [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=886.38s)]
*  take the view that they would like to grow. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=894.3s)]
*  It wasn't related to the Covid, but it was like the strategic move to look forward and [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=897.9399999999999s)]
*  start growing. They started to invest more to the whole company. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=904.9399999999999s)]
*  Actually, it's already started 2019 years and then we started to build new rooms. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=910.0999999999999s)]
*  We started it without knowing anything about the Covid. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=917.14s)]
*  So we just started to prepare for growing. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=921.94s)]
*  And actually, the new rooms were ready in the beginning of 2020. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=927.46s)]
*  So we were actually in the situation where we had empty rooms beginning of this Covid [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=934.1800000000001s)]
*  and then we had a chance to move and widen the production very easily. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=940.98s)]
*  Otherwise, if there wasn't this step before, then I think it wasn't so easy in this situation then. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=945.94s)]
*  Of course, like Katri already said, that we have very strong or very strict instructions [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=955.86s)]
*  for production. So it was very easy to bring in new people because it was if everybody [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=962.78s)]
*  came in and followed the instruction, everything should work. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=968.98s)]
*  So it was also more easy to bring in new employees. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=973.58s)]
*  And of course, the equipment what we had and as we had good relations with Saitiva [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=979.5s)]
*  before already, that we have used the Saitiva chromatograph before, then the contact with, [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=988.06s)]
*  for example, Karin Elving who helped us before to buy the new chromatographs. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=994.38s)]
*  So we contact them and they were also very supportive to, very quickly, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1000.82s)]
*  to organize us new equipment for purification. That's why it was very smoothly. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1007.7s)]
*  And of course, end of this 2020, we can manage this first wave of Covid. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1016.4200000000001s)]
*  We can manage by just multiplying this equipment and team. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1024.6599999999999s)]
*  And this was enough for the first wave. But we understood that if there will come the next one [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1030.82s)]
*  or third one, we need to scale up more. And then we decided to try to find more effective ways [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1038.02s)]
*  to produce, to increase our capacity. And then we went to the Uppsala to find solutions. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1047.22s)]
*  In cooperation with Saitiva, we had a chance to look at the solutions what they have to offer [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1057.06s)]
*  in this situation. If you need to scale up very rapidly and to find the best [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1065.54s)]
*  compatible solutions for that, this was a very good opportunity. And now we have [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1070.9s)]
*  more stronger pace for doing next steps. Yeah. You mentioned the new hires and the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1076.3400000000001s)]
*  importance of having established policies and protocols in place so that you can bring [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1084.5800000000002s)]
*  onboard those new hires rapidly. Were there any skill gaps that you had to train for? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1090.66s)]
*  Is there a readily available biotech workforce in Estonia? Give me a little more detail on that, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1098.5800000000002s)]
*  how you were able to triple effectively that team in short order. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1106.3400000000001s)]
*  I think this is of course also that we have this university city, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1114.66s)]
*  Tartu East University City, and we have a very strong bioscience sector already. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1118.82s)]
*  Basically, why we are here, like Uppsala is a university city, this is also Tartu, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1128.6599999999999s)]
*  and we were basically doing good cooperation. And of course, this sometimes is that in science, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1136.74s)]
*  the people are coming from research sector to also private companies, because here you can do, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1146.42s)]
*  and maybe you see your result of your work even more quickly, that this is something you can really [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1156.66s)]
*  do. And as we had the experience and motivation already high earlier, so just they said, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1164.3400000000001s)]
*  saw their opportunity and how they can basically do something for this world, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1176.18s)]
*  what is at the moment a very critical crisis. So basically, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1186.5800000000002s)]
*  to serve really the life science in a good way, basically, this was, I think, one way why we were [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1194.66s)]
*  able to bring in also newcomers. And again, that we have already experience, we have already this [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1202.82s)]
*  commitment and consistent quality, because sorry, I must say that what we have seen also earlier, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1211.54s)]
*  or this previous year, that in life sciences, there can be also [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1220.26s)]
*  such offers, which are not so good quality. So this is also a reality. But as we have our own [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1225.7s)]
*  facility, we are manufacturing and developing from the scratch, from the ground. And we are [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1238.42s)]
*  leading and commercializing it to already on spot to the partners and doing mutual cooperation. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1245.6200000000001s)]
*  This is, I think, the key component that they see that they know how and knowledge is going [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1254.66s)]
*  to be in life, in real result. This is very much important. The ambitions are visible. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1265.06s)]
*  But I would like to add, because when I came here, then I felt very like a supportive [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1276.66s)]
*  team. And then everybody are important. If you are working here, then you feel important. So I [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1285.78s)]
*  think it's a start to small, this legend of the companies also goes around, then the students or [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1292.34s)]
*  the doctor, they knew that this is actually a good company to come because here is also the [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1302.5s)]
*  vibe. Yes. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1312.5s)]
*  And how long, Angela, how long have you been with Solace Biodyne? [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1315.62s)]
*  Eight years. Eight years. Okay, excellent. Yeah. And you mentioned, I'm sorry. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1319.54s)]
*  And I started from production. And so I started doing from, I have actually been in all fields, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1325.54s)]
*  not in sales, but in lab site, in development, in production. So [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1333.06s)]
*  good overview of all what is in company. Yeah, excellent. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1338.6599999999999s)]
*  The business of biotech is brought to you in partnership with Saitiva. Together, we're committed [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1344.5s)]
*  to helping the leaders of new and emerging biopharma companies navigate the financial, [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1349.38s)]
*  organizational, human resources and regulatory waters you'll encounter on your way from [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1354.3400000000001s)]
*  discovery to the clinic and beyond. Check out a host of useful resources for biotech leaders [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1359.38s)]
*  at Saitiva's emerging biotech accelerator at Saitiva life sciences.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1365.8600000000001s)]
*  That's C Y T I V A life sciences.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1373.78s)]
*  You mentioned, Angela, that there was that you had some empty space into 2019 as you built out your [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1384.02s)]
*  growth plan, you had some empty space that you utilized. Do you anticipate I mean, is that space [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1392.74s)]
*  full now? Do you anticipate having to break some new ground on manufacturing capacity as you [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1397.54s)]
*  grow further? This is totally full already and we already tried to find new space. So this is [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1403.7s)]
*  already all occupied by machines, by employees. So this is totally full. Actually, in production [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1411.22s)]
*  and elsewhere, we are at the moment, tables are doubled, I mean, there are double and triple [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1419.38s)]
*  people per table, basically. Really, we must grow and find new rooms here and we are growing [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1428.42s)]
*  in the team also. So as not only human diagnostics, our plans are also hired to [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1440.26s)]
*  serve the applications in gene therapy in pharmaceutical directions, but this is the future. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1449.3s)]
*  So I think we would like to do like this way that everybody are here equal. If they want to do the [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1456.98s)]
*  work, if they have the goodwill to do the work, then this is the way how we care of our own people [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1467.38s)]
*  inside our team and also in cooperation with our partners and clients. And I am saying that [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1477.14s)]
*  if you are doing your work in a really honest way and you mean what you are doing or you do [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1484.9s)]
*  what you mean, then I think this is visible also in production, in development and in cooperation [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1491.14s)]
*  of the clients. And this is how we see it and therefore this is something, such a like a magic [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1498.66s)]
*  way. I want to work in daily time in normal conditions with normal people and therefore we [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1506.74s)]
*  invite smart, good people here and I think this are bringing more better and better and smarter [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1516.9s)]
*  people. Yeah, you know, and this is just, this is completely off the beaten path, but it's an [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1525.54s)]
*  observation that I made, Kadri and Angela, in preparing for this call, obviously I spent some [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1530.82s)]
*  time on your website and I couldn't help but notice that you are, you know, the majority of [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1536.58s)]
*  your employees are female. You saw more female, I don't know. I don't know, it appears as though [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1542.98s)]
*  your production team and your management team is, I should say the ratio of male to female looks [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1556.18s)]
*  a little bit higher than it does in your typical biotech. Is that, Kadri, by design or maybe there [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1562.9s)]
*  are more women in Estonia than men? Maybe the women in Estonia are just smarter than the men? [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1570.74s)]
*  I don't know, you tell me. I think we are not doing any, there are no difference. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1574.98s)]
*  It is important that people have their smart skills and experiences. Maybe in production, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1582.34s)]
*  of course, there are also different types of processes. Some processes are more, how to say, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1592.5s)]
*  routine. Some needs more different, how to say, experiences of development. So it just, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1598.58s)]
*  I think sometimes, yes, maybe Angela can talk about it. I wouldn't do the difference between [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1609.0600000000002s)]
*  female and male, but there are sometimes some people who are used to or like to do more routine [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1617.78s)]
*  processes and some other, but I think, I even don't know why it is like this. It just, [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1627.22s)]
*  it just, I would like to have them both here. I like them both, men and women. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1637.8600000000001s)]
*  That's good. And I bring it up because I think it's an important point to note because it's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1644.5s)]
*  exemplary. I mean, here in the States, there's quite a movement around getting more women involved in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1648.42s)]
*  science, technology, engineering and math careers because there are few, frankly. So I just note it [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1654.74s)]
*  because it's noteworthy and I think it's exemplary. I must say that at the moment, [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1662.8999999999999s)]
*  owners are just 50-50. I am one owner and my good partner is a man, Olev Kahre is a man, so I think [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1668.26s)]
*  we are, but it is okay. But I think in science also, the women's portion will be increased and [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1679.22s)]
*  also, I don't know, the ending of university still, I think these girls or women are, I don't know, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1687.38s)]
*  maybe they are more like, they would like to finish what they take. Men sometimes, they are [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1694.5s)]
*  more like, take more risks and they don't, I have to say. I think in university also, the women are [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1702.42s)]
*  more than men at the moment. So this is also... But what I can say again, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1708.9s)]
*  we are serving the biodiversity. This is the life, the main rule is biodiversity. So we need both [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1716.98s)]
*  men and women also because they have still different skills, they see the world a little [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1728.98s)]
*  bit differently and here in our processes, we need both. So we are very happy to bring in new [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1735.62s)]
*  people, whatever gender they are, whatever race they are, because we have at the moment also [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1743.7s)]
*  international team, not only Estonians, we have people from France, Belgium, Finland, whatever. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1750.1000000000001s)]
*  So whatever religion, so it doesn't matter until they are with us, they are in our team, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1758.02s)]
*  they have their will to work with us and find new innovative ideas and implement it and [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1767.62s)]
*  to have the results. So basically, not only science, but also how to use this science in [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1776.26s)]
*  the most better way, life science for better life and solid biodyne for better life science. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1783.62s)]
*  I like it. I like it. Good plug. So back to the conversation at hand here. Angela, I'm hoping you [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1791.14s)]
*  can elaborate a bit on the role of the Testa Center. First, tell us about the Testa Center. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1797.8600000000001s)]
*  What is it and what role did it play in your scale-up process and training and tech transfer [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1803.78s)]
*  approach? As I started to explain that we understood that we need to increase and [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1810.42s)]
*  find more effective or more efficient ways to production. Then we discussed with Site Diva, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1816.26s)]
*  our contact from Site Diva and we just talked about our worry and Karin helping, she said that, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1823.86s)]
*  okay, but we have this kind of opportunity that you don't need to buy all this, what you think [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1834.26s)]
*  before you haven't used it or tried how it works and does it is compatible for your needs. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1840.18s)]
*  She introduced this Testa Center that this is this kind of center where you can just go, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1850.82s)]
*  you have the opportunities to use different equipment, different like downstream, upstream [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1857.46s)]
*  machines. You can choose, look, try and then you can later on you can choose what is the best [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1863.14s)]
*  solution for you. And yes, there was possibility to use different the bigger scale bioreactor. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1870.9s)]
*  At the moment in our facility we have smaller one and then we went to the Testa Center. We had [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1879.3s)]
*  the possibility to use 50 liter bioreactor. We had the possibility to use a higher or [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1884.8999999999999s)]
*  bigger scale of chromatographs. We have a lot of experience by one type of Site Diva ones, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1894.1s)]
*  but there was all what Site Diva has, what does at least they have. So also there was [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1901.54s)]
*  like experienced team who can help you to support in every step you would like to try. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1912.82s)]
*  And we were very much flexible because as we said, okay, now we have this kind of problem. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1923.62s)]
*  What is what you are thinking, what can help and they at all the times they had some kind of [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1929.06s)]
*  solution for that. So they tried to bring new equipment, new idea, new methods for solving [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1934.4199999999998s)]
*  this kind of problem. So this is for example, in production we can be at the moment we have used [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1941.46s)]
*  columns for purification what are like available in the market. But in the center we had chance [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1951.7s)]
*  to pack ourselves to do different scales of packing the columns. So use different media for [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1958.18s)]
*  column. So this is yeah, we could try everything what we come came to the mind and see does it [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1964.42s)]
*  okay for us or not. Yeah. I wonder cost effective way how to say to use such a fitting room. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1972.98s)]
*  Yeah. How to the best to get to take in or buy in new solutions already to our future [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1982.26s)]
*  projects also. And what I remember you said very good word about the test center people [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1992.98s)]
*  that they were really very supportive, very kind, very again, very cooperative, especially also. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=1999.38s)]
*  Yes. They also like I said that if they had problems, they also think about that. They [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2006.18s)]
*  just didn't say that, okay, try yourself. They also went to the computer and tried to [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2013.3s)]
*  look the papers to read something what can help us. So they were very supportive. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2018.74s)]
*  Where is that center physically or geographically? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2025.7s)]
*  Very close. This is in Sweden in Uppsala. This is in this area of Saitiva. This is [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2029.46s)]
*  this center is built in cooperation of [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2039.22s)]
*  Sweden government and Saitiva to support the small scale startups, research groups [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2044.9s)]
*  who don't have this, for example, maybe the resources for buying everything in [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2052.26s)]
*  or to scale up or try to try something different. Also, that you can know first, again, I must repeat [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2059.78s)]
*  that this was kind of fitting room. You try on the new clothes, you try maybe different [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2067.3s)]
*  machines a little bit. Is it suiting for us? What I remember when you came back, first thing what [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2074.5s)]
*  you also told here was that it was kind of very good to see that we are on the right track, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2083.46s)]
*  but at the same time we understood that this is such a two-way compatibility is needed. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2092.66s)]
*  That we are working with the living organisms. We are working with bacteria basically and you must [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2100.2599999999998s)]
*  fit and put together the adjusting our instructions and also the machine or devices or equipment [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2107.8599999999997s)]
*  or such instructions or how to get the best outcome of it. Basically, that not [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2117.7799999999997s)]
*  it can be, you can think such a logical way that okay we are tripling or doubling or scaling up [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2129.7s)]
*  and it should be the same, but it is not. The life is different. Bacteria is behaving differently. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2137.7s)]
*  This is not only the bacteria. You must adapt the whole system. This was basically very good [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2147.46s)]
*  knowledge what we get. This experience, this experiment was very good for us. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2156.8199999999997s)]
*  That this is normal. That life is behaving differently and you must all the time adapt. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2162.1s)]
*  Therefore, this is I think such a both-way knowledge not only to us who are using and [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2170.18s)]
*  working with living organisms, but also the equipment providers. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2178.98s)]
*  Actually, it was in the same area where Saitiva manufacturers, so that it was a possibility to [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2188.9s)]
*  get very easily if you came to the mind that you want to use this one, then it was very easy to [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2195.3s)]
*  get it. New machine, new equipment, new columns, new media. It was very fast to get whatever you [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2200.5s)]
*  came to the mind to try. This was very good for me. As you made decisions around that equipment [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2205.86s)]
*  and those processes and handled tech transfer, was there support in the transport and [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2214.26s)]
*  installation of that equipment in your facility in Estonia? Actually, today I had a phone call [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2221.7s)]
*  about the new purification system. What we actually used in the test center and we understood that [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2229.62s)]
*  this is the right one. Today we had this call and to set up this exact configuration for that, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2240.3399999999997s)]
*  what we tested, what is the best one, what we need. So actually, it's not that far away when [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2247.78s)]
*  we will be in Sarthe. So it is such a practical, very practical outcome and I would like to see [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2253.5400000000004s)]
*  and suggest also to the others such a cooperation. Also, us with our partners, the best [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2262.42s)]
*  result is coming through cooperation. If we both are thinking how to get the best result, basically, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2271.78s)]
*  that we are both ready to adapt both sides all the time. I think here is coming not just that, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2281.3s)]
*  okay, let's have it, let's make it very cheap. This is not the way how to do good things. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2288.02s)]
*  You must go into the details. The details are very much important. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2293.78s)]
*  Yeah. So speaking of not cheap, I'm curious, this rapid growth has to be funded somewhere. What's [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2299.2200000000003s)]
*  the funding strategy at Solace BioDyne and where's the money coming from today and where do you see [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2308.34s)]
*  it coming from in the future? Basically, I think this is coming still from the clients [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2314.1800000000003s)]
*  because I think that we have, our network of the clients has been already very wide for years. So [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2321.62s)]
*  we had to start from nothing and we, but from the start already, we developed and produced and [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2333.54s)]
*  serving our first clients. Then we started to recapitalize and basically, we reinvested our [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2344.02s)]
*  money back and back and back. We have hold our money, not just bent away, but all the time, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2354.5s)]
*  reinvested our money back. Of course, in smaller scales, we have also used European funds money, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2361.22s)]
*  for instance, in exporting systems or now also in some development where it is possible. But [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2379.2999999999997s)]
*  mostly, the money is coming from our wide range of clients, basically. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2390.2599999999998s)]
*  Excellent. We must do just very, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2399.54s)]
*  very, how to say smart steps, how to focus better because such a privacy, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2403.86s)]
*  privately held company gives us also flexibility to change our focuses, to be more precise. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2417.7000000000003s)]
*  If you don't have very much money, then you do it more smartly. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2426.42s)]
*  Money is needed and this definitely needed because investments need money to development, [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2433.46s)]
*  to production, innovative production, innovative cooperation. But I think if we do it in smart way [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2442.9s)]
*  and innovative way, we can keep on going in flexible way and we held such [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2449.86s)]
*  independency in how to do cooperation. That's great. Yeah, excellent. We're running a bit [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2459.6200000000003s)]
*  short on time. I just want to wrap up here with one last question for you both. We talked about [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2469.2200000000003s)]
*  this a little bit already, but give us some insight into the biotech environment or scene [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2476.34s)]
*  in Estonia. I spent a little bit of time checking out the Tartu Science Park as best I could from [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2482.34s)]
*  Pennsylvania. It looks like a very sophisticated, relatively new facility. You mentioned that you've [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2488.9s)]
*  got the support of university there in Tartu. What do you see for the future of biotech [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2498.82s)]
*  in Estonia? Is it a growing space there? Definitely. We have people at 1.3 million, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2506.9s)]
*  but we have several university cities and the basic university city is in Tartu. We have not [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2519.78s)]
*  so many, but still we have also privately held companies like one is doing with antibodies dealing, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2528.18s)]
*  but I think we have good cooperation with different institutions of Tartu University. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2536.8199999999997s)]
*  For instance, one is Genome Center, who is dealing with basically, for instance, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2546.4199999999996s)]
*  last we have just good cooperation with Genomic Institute. I think we must all serve the whole [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2557.22s)]
*  world. It is not only that we are doing in our small country something, but we are all the time [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2567.14s)]
*  cooperating in science, in research and also in real production and the developments also with the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2573.7s)]
*  other universities in Europe, in the US, like we are doing at the moment, working with German [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2582.5s)]
*  universities, working with institutions in all European countries, US, South America, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2592.66s)]
*  also South Korea, Japan, China, Australia, so Middle East. We have connections. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2602.66s)]
*  I think it's the same. We discussed about the money that if you have few, then you have to be [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2612.2599999999998s)]
*  more precise. I think in Estonia, as we have so few, we have to be very smart and [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2617.62s)]
*  do very well at what we do. So it's also in the biotech that we also try to compete also with the [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2625.2999999999997s)]
*  world. So we have to make wise decisions, wise and innovative task or job we need to find. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2634.1s)]
*  So this is the same that you have to survive if you are so small also. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2644.74s)]
*  Well, you guys, you are doing better than surviving. I mean, the company's growth is incredible, [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2650.18s)]
*  noteworthy. It sounds like you are doing a great job managing that growth and planning for future [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2657.22s)]

*  It seems like everyone has got tech transfer and scale up and capacity challenges today. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2668.02s)]
*  So this is a great success story and I wish you both continued success. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2675.38s)]
*  Yes, and I again stress this, that this is important cooperation between different [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2680.9s)]

*  really high quality, really all the details what are important, not going down with the quality [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2696.2599999999998s)]
*  procedures, even if it is the crisis period, because it comes back better if you do in right [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2704.42s)]

*  but really we are small, but let's do business together. Let's cooperate. I think here, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V6ncCcders&t=2729.3s)]
