*  I'm your host, Ben Comer, Chief Editor at Life Science Leader, and today I'm thrilled [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=46.46s)]
*  to speak with Tom Wells, Director of Life Sciences at 4C Associates, about procurement [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=51.3s)]
*  practices, an issue that can stymie promising biotech companies during critical growth and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=57.9s)]
*  development stages if not done correctly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  Tom has worked in a variety of procurement roles at companies including Novartis, Takeda, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  and most recently BMS before joining 4C Associates, a London-based commercial supply chain and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=72.25999999999999s)]
*  operations consultancy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=79.72s)]
*  Tom is passionate about procurement and the ways it can impact a growing biotech business, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=82.08s)]
*  and I'm looking forward to learning more along with our Business of Biotech listeners about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=87.66s)]
*  how procurement can make or break biotech. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=92.0s)]
*  Tom, thank you so much for being here. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=95.0s)]
*  Pleasure to be here. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=97.2s)]
*  I mentioned in the introduction that you are passionate about procurement, an issue that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=99.56s)]
*  can be overlooked or under managed by growing companies despite its importance. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=105.1s)]
*  Why did you decide to spend the bulk of your career on procurement issues and how did you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=112.6s)]
*  get started in it initially? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=118.0s)]
*  Well, I actually started from university. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=119.74s)]
*  I read Boston University or Clang Science and then went into marketing, first of all [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=122.69999999999999s)]
*  for a wine and spirit retail company in the UK, then moved to H.J. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=129.29999999999998s)]
*  Hines, the food company, as a brand manager. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=134.02s)]
*  From there, I went to various different marketing communications agencies based in London before [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=137.3s)]
*  moving back in-house with Electrolux, the white goods company. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=144.22s)]
*  First of all, as head of corporate comms for Western Europe and then as head of brand PR [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=149.02s)]
*  worldwide. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=154.18s)]
*  It was in that job that I really came across procurement for the first time. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Up to that point, my view probably would have been that procurement for those annoying [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=160.74s)]
*  people who upset agencies, get contracts wrong, bungle payments and generally getting away [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=165.3s)]
*  and that will slow things down. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=169.74s)]
*  But I was asked to help work on an internal campaign to reposition procurement in the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=171.54000000000002s)]
*  eyes of the business and help people understand what procurement is and what it actually does. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  Which company was that? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  This was Electrolux. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=186.06s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=187.06s)]
*  Based on in Sweden. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=189.06s)]
*  And the program was all about repositioning procurements in the eyes of the business, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=191.74s)]
*  in the eyes of suppliers, trying to help people understand that procurement is actually, it's [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=196.06s)]
*  not the back end of supply chain. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=199.82s)]
*  It's really the front end of demand flow. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=201.66s)]
*  It's the part of the business which can bring in new ideas, new suppliers, new ways of working [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  and so on. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=208.58s)]
*  But it did also make me think when I was working on that project, why is it that marketing [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=210.12s)]
*  people such as me at the time, procurement people just weren't speaking when we're working [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=215.58s)]
*  together and why were there so many of the cliches that marketing people thought of procurement [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=220.58s)]
*  as being a difficult process by getting in the way, slowing things down, whereas procurement [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=226.02s)]
*  people probably thought of marketing people as being spent through after-bill schools [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=231.22000000000003s)]
*  and people who couldn't be trusted with money. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  This came back a few years. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=237.06s)]
*  And the whole process is intriguing and eventually I decided it wouldn't it be great if procurement [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=239.98000000000002s)]
*  people and marketing people could work more effectively together. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=245.42s)]
*  And I eventually left Electrolux to set up my own marketing procurement consultancy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  And I wasn't as much working on the sort of contracting and negotiations and pricing and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=254.06s)]
*  so on, but it was much more helping the client side of the relationship understand how agencies [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=259.58s)]
*  work and like the best ways of working with the suppliers they're working with. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  My view was then and always has been that you make it a little bit extra valuable in [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=271.74s)]
*  short term if you try and negotiate with your agency to the suppliers on financial. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=276.58s)]
*  But if you understand how they work, how they make profit, what engages and motivates their [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  people and what it takes to help them develop their business as a result of the good work [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  they've done for you, then you'll find that that agency will give you infinitely greater [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=294.82s)]
*  value than you could possibly get by trying to cut the price. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=300.06s)]
*  So I spent a few years running that consultancy business. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=304.26s)]
*  I worked with Coca-Cola and Pepsi in various different areas, with McDonald's Europe, with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=307.26s)]
*  General Motors Europe, but bit by bit I found myself working more and more with pharma companies. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=312.86s)]
*  And I guess that's because after the financial crash in 2007, 2008, governments, particularly [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=319.1s)]
*  European governments, put a huge amount of money into supporting their currencies and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=325.74s)]
*  their markets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=330.82s)]
*  They were looking to cut costs elsewhere and so started putting more pressure on pharmaceutical [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=331.82s)]
*  companies, always an easy target for government which meet money, especially the big nasty [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=338.06s)]
*  drugs companies. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=343.46000000000004s)]
*  In the five years to 2008, the average price of pharmaceuticals in Europe went up every [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=345.38s)]
*  year. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=350.1s)]
*  In the five years after 2008, it went down as a year. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=351.1s)]
*  So pharma companies, particularly in the marketing area, needed to become much more [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=355.5s)]
*  disciplined, much more savvy about what they were spending and how they were spending it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=359.06s)]
*  And so I found myself working more and more for pharma companies. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=364.14s)]
*  And then one day I happened to approach from the Varsis in Switzerland, and work in global [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=367.42s)]
*  catering needs for market research and then for marketing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=375.34s)]
*  So moved the family to Switzerland, spent about five years with the Varsis, working [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=378.86s)]
*  in marketing, marketing research, and then moved from the Varsis to Takeda as the global [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=385.26s)]
*  procurement lead for travel, meet and host events. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=390.5s)]
*  And from there to Bristol Myers Squip, I moved from having sort of vertical global roles [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=393.78s)]
*  to horizontal reaching roles, covering pretty much everything that the companies spend money [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=398.78s)]
*  on. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=403.9s)]
*  And then up until the end of 2024, I was reaching the Canada, Latin America, Turkey, Israel, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=405.78s)]
*  and most of APEC. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  And from there to Fawsey Associates at the beginning of March of this year. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=418.02s)]
*  I want to get your kind of broad definition of what procurement is and what it means to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=423.85999999999996s)]
*  you. And maybe as a way to start that conversation, could you describe kind of that transition [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=430.02s)]
*  from marketing services into pharma and what the procurement job entailed? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=437.29999999999995s)]
*  Were there complete, I guess, analogous types of jobs that you were doing with pharma versus [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=443.62s)]
*  with a consumer packaged goods company? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=451.38s)]
*  Were they issues similar or was there a kind of stark difference in the kinds of procurement [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=453.7s)]
*  jobs that you were doing for pharma versus your prior work in consumer packaged goods? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=460.9s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=467.22s)]
*  I mean, I think that when it's being done properly, when it's being done well, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=468.26s)]
*  I think that the basics of procurement are the same across every industry. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=475.21999999999997s)]
*  So again, procurement is not the back end supply chain, but it's very much the front end of demand [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=481.14s)]
*  flow. And it's the door to the rest of the world. It's the function which can bring in new ideas [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=486.18s)]
*  and so on. And I think whichever industry you're in, it starts with having the knowledge [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=493.46s)]
*  and the insights partner with the business. And in the case of life sciences, and this is different [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=498.58s)]
*  from consumer goods or anything else, I think the key in the pharma industry is to be able to [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=503.85999999999996s)]
*  understand the scientific and the business objectives and strategy and the priorities. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=509.29999999999995s)]
*  And that, I think, is the core difference. The life sciences across the piece, not just pharma, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=515.46s)]
*  but the agro-pathology life sciences, does need a really good understanding of how the business [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=522.02s)]
*  works and how the science works. Otherwise, it's difficult to know what actually constitutes value [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=527.6999999999999s)]
*  for your business. So in my case, I've been a procurement firm for quite some time. When I [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=536.8199999999999s)]
*  was working at BMS, I realized that maybe my commercial understanding and my cross-function [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=542.5s)]
*  understanding wasn't everything that others wanted to be. Bristol Myers Squibb has a wonderful [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=549.06s)]
*  system called a tour of duty, which is to spend three months or six months in a completely difficult [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=554.7399999999999s)]
*  crystal assumption, learning how things work, and just building your real perspective. So I actually [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  spent six months working at a commercial in BMS on a project to look at re-commercializing a bunch [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=565.78s)]
*  of different drugs, which had a problem that had passed. And I was able to work across [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=572.82s)]
*  regulatory VAP, forecasting, finance, production, and get many, many different functions. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=578.34s)]
*  That gave me a lot more understanding of the business and science, because I had to read [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=584.98s)]
*  myself into the Journal of Transplantology, the British Journal of Nephrology, and many other [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=591.62s)]
*  publications in order to be able to understand everything else that was happening with this [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=597.46s)]
*  particular drug. So yeah, in any industry, it's about having the knowledge and the insights to [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=601.38s)]
*  be a credible business partner, and to understand what the scientist is trying to do, what the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=607.38s)]
*  business is trying to do, what its strategies are, and what its priorities are. And from that, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=613.38s)]
*  I think you can start to identify the resources and the services that the business needs in order [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=618.5s)]
*  to deliver that strategy and achieve those objectives. And from there, you can go out to [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=624.5s)]
*  the board, external market, to look at all of the best possible providers, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=629.7s)]
*  answer for purposeful innovation, a reach for action to deliver this for a business. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=634.1800000000001s)]
*  Then obviously, negotiate and contract an onboard new supplier of the drug, maybe, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=639.46s)]
*  manage the risk and the client's issues, but to do all of that in a way which means you can build [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=646.0200000000001s)]
*  a mutually productive relationship and low return value. And then obviously, work with this, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=652.4200000000001s)]
*  the stakeholders and the suppliers to maintain and to leverage those relationships for the loiter. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=658.98s)]
*  So most of those things are exactly the same for any industry. The part I think is key for [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  life sciences is that, is the ability to understand the science and the business of the science, [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=672.1s)]
*  because that really does dictate everything else which you try and do. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=677.78s)]
*  When you say the back end, procurement should not be at the back end of the supply chain, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=681.86s)]
*  are you talking about the kind of tactical transactional role of procurement in negotiating [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=686.42s)]
*  contracts, managing technical issues and compliance versus the front end of demand flow, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  which I think I'm hearing you say is more relational, more holistic, gives you a sense of [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=704.5799999999999s)]
*  the top priorities of the business and how to meet those requirements through procurement. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=710.82s)]
*  Is that correct? What would you add to that? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=718.98s)]
*  I think you need to have all of the end-to-end steps and everything actually at the back end, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=721.94s)]
*  the procurement processes of how do we write a contract, how do we negotiate, how do we pay [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=727.86s)]
*  people, how do we manage inverses, how do we manage cash flow, all those things are [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=732.58s)]
*  fundamental to procurement. They're far from value-less, they are critical, but they don't [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=737.06s)]
*  necessarily add value. I think for the procurement function to add value, you need to put the answers [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=745.2199999999999s)]
*  very much at the front end as well. To be able to take that proactive role in understanding, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=752.42s)]
*  not just what is it that someone wants me to buy, but what is it that the business or [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=759.54s)]
*  person that's functioning actually needs in order to be able to operate and operate better [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=765.06s)]
*  and add more value to business and ultimately more value for the patient. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=770.42s)]
*  So I think you need the backbone of procurement process and discipline and rigor and making sure [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=775.62s)]
*  that everything is done correctly. There's a lot of compliance, one recognition, and we're dealing [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=781.6999999999999s)]
*  with other people's money, but you need to add to that the scientific and business partnering to be [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=785.9399999999999s)]
*  able to drive real value all the way through the chain. Right. As you say, money is kind of [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=793.62s)]
*  at the root of procurement, you're spending money for services. What are some of the ways that early [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=803.7s)]
*  stage biotechs can use procurement as a strategic tool to create value? Then we'll talk about on the [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=810.42s)]
*  flip side of that, where companies go wrong with procurement to bad ends. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=819.38s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think if you look at what actually is value for early stage biotechs, [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=825.54s)]
*  it goes far beyond cost. Obviously, the money is important, but it's by balancing price and the [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=832.02s)]
*  cost of operation. If you look at the money, there are really four things which you can do. You can [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=838.34s)]
*  pay less, or you can pay smarter, or you can spend less, or you can spend smarter. In terms of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=843.22s)]
*  procurement managing how much do you spend and what's to be spent on, you need to balance each [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=850.26s)]
*  of those four things. If you focus solely on how much do we pay and how can we pay less, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=856.4200000000001s)]
*  you might get to a situation where you've managed to persuade, bully, negotiate, whatever, a supplier [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=863.14s)]
*  doing something for less. Are they going to be a resilient supplier? Are they going to really want [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=869.22s)]
*  to do business with you? Do you run the risk of pushing the price you pay so low that you begin [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=875.46s)]
*  to damage or to erode the goodwill of that supplier workbook for you? Managing the money side, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=881.38s)]
*  you've got to be holistic and think, pay less, pay smarter, spend less, spend smarter. Balance [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=887.62s)]
*  those and you will get to a financial outcome. Where a problem with function for your team can [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=892.98s)]
*  help is they can help anticipate and mitigate risk in supply chain. They can bring more [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=903.94s)]
*  operational efficiency. They can help you get to market more quickly. In particular, they can help [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=910.26s)]
*  you find innovative solutions and different ways of doing things. Not just different supplies, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=915.94s)]
*  but completely different ways of meeting opportunity or solving problems. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=920.9s)]
*  I think you can also help the business become a customer who the most critical suppliers most [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=926.66s)]
*  want to do business with. I think in this increasing VUCA world that's built in, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=933.22s)]
*  I do think that's becoming more and more important. The way I've looked at it is that [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=942.02s)]
*  as the world gets more… I'll take a bit back from that. The nature of new pharma products [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=952.34s)]
*  is changing and we see there's a big shift towards smaller systems areas and more specialist [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=960.98s)]
*  therapies. That means that the whole R&D process is getting much more complex and much more [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=966.42s)]
*  expensive. That in turn means that supply chains are getting much more complicated and much more [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=972.42s)]
*  expensive. In particular, much more complicated both upstream and downstream. Downstream, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=979.62s)]
*  if a patient has a wearable, they can actually become part of our supply chain because they can [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=986.18s)]
*  be providing a Dixie which goes to their HCP. Their HCP might then pass it back to a [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=991.38s)]
*  Dixie, Glomerator or a pharma company or whatever. The patient can actually become part of the entire [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=996.58s)]
*  supply chain. What we see as a result of all of that is that the industry is becoming ever more [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1003.78s)]
*  reliant on smaller and more specialist suppliers. The resilience of your supply chain, particularly [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1010.18s)]
*  as a merchant biotech, becomes ever more critical because the question is, can you rely on your [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1018.8199999999999s)]
*  supplier still being there in a year's time? As you're starting out down a long road using [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1024.82s)]
*  someone else's money, you need to be able to pick suppliers to last the course and we'll get to [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1031.7s)]
*  want to continue working with you. The power then starts to shift towards the supplier and you as [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1038.34s)]
*  a specimen might begin to spend more on the supplier than they depend on you. That means [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1046.9s)]
*  that you need to be the customer who they most want to do business with. You need to position [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1053.8600000000001s)]
*  yourselves as the customer of choice. I think you see some great examples of this. I think the whole [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1060.5s)]
*  area of regular politics is a great example where there are many, many therapies coming through [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1069.8600000000001s)]
*  which have gravitated towards actinium isotopes. This will be the ideal isotope for many of these [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1075.62s)]
*  therapies. There is still no reliable supply chain for the key isotopes of actinium. It is available, [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1083.2199999999998s)]
*  but many, many companies are fighting to get their share of it. If you're a customer who has [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1093.2199999999998s)]
*  habitually tried to force your supplier to take a lower price or we keep changing your mind or [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1099.7s)]
*  messing up their workflow and their cash flow or if you talk about orders but then they're placed [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1106.18s)]
*  in whatever field it is. If you're that kind of customer, when your supplier is under the same [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1110.98s)]
*  kind of class, political, economic, social, technological, political stress that you are, [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1118.18s)]
*  your supplier will become more wary. They want to concentrate on protecting their workflow, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1124.34s)]
*  their cash flow, their profitability. They will favor the customers who they trust most. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1130.18s)]
*  The question moves away from the area. It needs to be who do I trust as a supplier? Now I think it [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1138.1s)]
*  has become a who trusts me. This is where procurement can play a key role for [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1143.78s)]
*  emerging biotechs because I think that companies that are better able to explore new suppliers [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1152.1s)]
*  but then engage more effectively with them and enable those suppliers to build their business [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1158.98s)]
*  as a result are going to get a competitive advantage because they're going to be the ones [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1164.58s)]
*  the customer with whom those suppliers will be most willing and most able to help [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1169.3s)]
*  when we are in conditions of real operational stress. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1174.6599999999999s)]
*  How do companies position themselves as that customer of choice on a very specific level? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1179.46s)]
*  I mean is it the individuals that are negotiating the service orders and how that relationship [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1188.34s)]
*  evolves? Are there other things that companies can do to kind of raise their profile with their [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1198.26s)]
*  suppliers or endear themselves to suppliers so that they are kind of reaping the benefits [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1206.18s)]
*  of that kind of relationship? There are a lot of things and they all come down to, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1213.46s)]
*  I was going to say human decency, they come down to behavior. It's all about treat people as you [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1220.18s)]
*  want to be treated. And it's remember that even everyone at Beale's Supplies, they're people too, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1226.58s)]
*  they're trying to run their own businesses. And if you understand what pressures your supplier is [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1233.3s)]
*  on to it, whether it's the pressures that you're under and trying to look at what would I want to [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1240.4199999999998s)]
*  do, what's going to help us build a business relationship which actually goes beyond mere [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1245.9399999999998s)]
*  bonds or beyond money, but actually helps us focus on not just on cost but on service, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1254.3400000000001s)]
*  on innovation, on to create the mutual maintenance. And it comes down ultimately to working [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1262.0200000000002s)]
*  with people as people. And I think really that's it. In what I could call less sophisticated [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1267.94s)]
*  procurement operations, you will very often find that there's an absolute focus on cost. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1278.9s)]
*  Yeah, we've got to meet the cost savings, we've got to get the price down. I want 10% off everything. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1284.26s)]
*  Well, in a VUCA world, and as I say, sometimes in a world which has gone from VUCA to WTF, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1288.9s)]
*  because that's the volatility of the terms that we now live in, is it more important to have the [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1295.6200000000001s)]
*  lowest possible price? Or is it better to have a degree of sort of affordable confidence when, [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1301.94s)]
*  okay, I probably could push the supply to a lower price, but do I want to? Because if I do, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1308.58s)]
*  I may get some small short-term advantage. Am I really giving myself a longer-term value? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1316.5s)]
*  So again, think of people as people and people as businesses are done by people. And start from that [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1324.98s)]
*  basis. I think the basis of everything successful, particularly in a world like [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1334.1s)]
*  procurement, is it's almost integrity and it's a degree of self-awareness. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1339.6999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And Tom mentioned VUCA or the acronym for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1346.6599999999999s)]
*  And moving to WTF, which I probably don't need to tell this audience what that stands for. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1354.5s)]
*  Your description of this relationship between the drug developer and suppliers, it sounds like [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1360.82s)]
*  there really needs to be a kind of give and take there, a recognition of, to your point, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1367.94s)]
*  what the supplier needs to succeed in addition to what your own company needs to succeed. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1374.98s)]
*  And it's behavioral, it's people relationships is what you're saying. Is there anything else, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1382.18s)]
*  that you could say about maybe what companies specifically should think about when they're [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1389.7s)]
*  engaging a supplier? Clearly, they want to help that supplier accomplish its goals, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1395.06s)]
*  but how do you understand what those goals are? How do you become that trusted partner that is [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1400.74s)]
*  really aligned with a dual set of objectives? What are the great procurement acronyms? It's [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1407.1399999999999s)]
*  APU-SCI, which has a security assurance, quality, service, cost, and innovation. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1415.7s)]
*  So when you're starting to work with a, when you're starting to look for suppliers, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1423.14s)]
*  you would start with assurance, which is, I didn't want to do two digits. Can I be sure that this [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1428.5800000000002s)]
*  company exists? Can I be sure about its financial history? Do any of its directors and officers have [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1433.06s)]
*  criminal records or all of those things? So I say, right, first of all, I'm sure myself about the [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1438.3400000000001s)]
*  basic operating credentials of a potential supplier. Then I might look at the quality. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1444.5s)]
*  Can they do what they say they would? How do I know, how can I measure and manage the productivity? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1451.22s)]
*  What about how I'm looking to buy and so on? Then I would look at the service levels of what constitutes [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1457.06s)]
*  good service to me and to my business. What is a, what are the sensible binnumers I should expect? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1465.14s)]
*  Should expect how quickly do I expect to be able to pull back if I have a problem? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1473.22s)]
*  Those are basic hygiene factors. Only then might I say, okay, if I've looked at various companies [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1478.5s)]
*  and I've readied them out through the assurance, quality, and service levels, then I might look at [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1485.06s)]
*  cost. And so, okay, of the ones who rule, I wrote my basic standards, which ones can give me the [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1490.1s)]
*  best price or the best value. And then as a final differential factor, which ones can give me [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1496.74s)]
*  information, can give me something extra, which maybe some of the other ones can't. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1504.66s)]
*  So those are the basic things which procurement should be set about to work for. But all of that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1509.22s)]
*  needs to be driven by a very clear understanding of what is it that my business actually needs. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1515.6200000000001s)]
*  And that's where the partnership starts. If you have a good, if the procurement team and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1521.94s)]
*  each different business function, they have a good relationship. It's based on, [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1529.0600000000002s)]
*  yeah, mutual respect and understanding and the fact that they might understand what the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1532.9s)]
*  business is in terms of science and that we can have an intelligent conversation about the actual [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1538.9s)]
*  problem and maybe help give other suggestions, bring in some new ideas. If we can build that [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1546.34s)]
*  partnership, it's then much easier to build the third partnership, which is the supplier. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1552.1799999999998s)]
*  And then ideally, you would have your business stakeholder and your whole post-management [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1558.98s)]
*  supplier working absolutely together as a threesome. It's not a different two-way relationship. You [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1565.22s)]
*  really want to have it there as a threesome because again, that's what helps build the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1571.06s)]
*  familiarity that builds the trust and it builds the willingness to go a little bit further or to [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1575.94s)]
*  offer a little bit more either when there's an opportunity or when there's a particular issue or [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1582.82s)]
*  stress. Right. Let's talk about early stage biopharma companies. As a company grows, naturally, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1588.74s)]
*  it needs to acquire different and new resources, different kinds of services. I could think of a [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1598.4199999999998s)]
*  situation where you have a scientific founder who maybe invented the platform technology, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1607.54s)]
*  is in the very earliest preclinical stages of development, but now is having to hire in [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1613.78s)]
*  preparation for clinical trials, is having to add perhaps office space, is having to [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1620.8999999999999s)]
*  purchase a lot of things that perhaps is a first-time purchase for that company. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1628.34s)]
*  What are some of those issues that you've encountered in your career or any kind of [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1635.62s)]
*  examples that you can give where companies should be careful about how they are managing [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1642.82s)]
*  that procurement process? Absolutely. I think there are two big inflection points in [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1648.58s)]
*  the biopharma companies growth. The first really is moving from preclinical to clinical, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1654.42s)]
*  and then the second, further on down the line, is moving from clinical into commercial stage. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1660.3400000000001s)]
*  When you look at that jump from preclinical to clinical, I know that's a broad term, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1665.3000000000002s)]
*  and like you say, you suddenly need to start acquiring a whole lot of resources and services, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1670.5800000000002s)]
*  which may be scientific, so CROs, lab space, reagents, maybe data or whatever, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1675.78s)]
*  but also non-scientific. Suddenly, you start needing employees, so you need office space. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1681.78s)]
*  You might need cars. You need employee life assurance policies. You need primary market [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1687.06s)]
*  research. You need law firms. You need marketing agencies. You need a coffee machine. You need [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1692.02s)]
*  someone who's going to come in and change the flowers under the chef's desk once every [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1697.54s)]
*  week. You suddenly start needing all of these different things, which first of all, a lot of [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1701.54s)]
*  the complex, most of them tend to be expensive, and almost all of them, because this is [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1706.34s)]
*  Flamanand, are very much burdened by compliance and by regulation. But the leadership team, [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1711.6999999999998s)]
*  like say the scientific drivers of the business, seldom have very much expertise in planning, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1718.8999999999999s)]
*  spending in those areas. But very few preclinicians at that stage of growth have a procurement [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1726.34s)]
*  team or a procurement person who's got the depth and breadth of skills and experience by them. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1733.86s)]
*  To negotiate for, or to find someone who can change the flower section that's been there a [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1740.82s)]
*  week, a couple of weeks, not so differently, but to negotiate with the CRO, there you need [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1745.3s)]
*  not just tactical expertise and negotiate with the CROs, but you need someone who can take a step [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1750.82s)]
*  back and take the strategic view of what we're trying to do and how we'll be working with this [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1755.3799999999999s)]
*  plant over the next two to three or four, whatever number it is. And so because the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1759.7s)]
*  early stage organisations seldom have that experience or expertise, it is very easy to [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1767.3s)]
*  stand off by making mistakes, to build in indiscipline spending habits, or to waste or [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1773.3s)]
*  maybe tie up funds that should actually be supported on the clinical agenda. And it's also [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1781.06s)]
*  easy to miss opportunities for innovative approaches or for suppliers who can bring that [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1788.18s)]
*  X factor because the overstressed e-shitting, they reach the providers they know, the people [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1793.7s)]
*  they work with in the past because they feel they can trust them. That's not necessarily a bad thing, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1800.02s)]
*  but it can be limiting. I was talking to a sort of mid-tree blue stage some weeks back at a conference [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1805.78s)]
*  with a few of the best people that I've seen, and they said, we don't have a problem with [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1814.34s)]
*  children because we've all done this before, we know who we're going to work with. I said, yes, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1820.1s)]
*  what about all the ones which you don't know? What could you be missing? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1827.1399999999999s)]
*  And again, in these increasingly lucrative times, the LTs don't have the bandwidth either to be [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1831.62s)]
*  managing currency fluctuations or worrying about their fragile supply chain or dealing with [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1840.9s)]
*  flaky suppliers or chasing unpaid invoices. Those are all disciplines which they need to [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1846.18s)]
*  be concentrated on building the business of driving the science, not all those sort of factors. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1851.7800000000002s)]
*  And they are really absolutely at their most exposed. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1857.46s)]
*  HOFFMAN You're absolutely right. People wear a lot of hats in early stage biotech. I could [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1863.06s)]
*  understand that a procurement specialist may not be on staff, especially in the early days. Is it [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1870.8999999999999s)]
*  your recommendation though that a company that is say, moving into clinical trials, scaling up [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1878.82s)]
*  manufacturing, making a lot of purchases, even if they're not willing to pay a full-time salary to [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1884.98s)]
*  a procurement person, should they consider a fractional kind of employee relationship or even [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1892.02s)]
*  a part-time consultant? Or is it something that a company can work through or figure out itself? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1899.22s)]
*  I guess my question is, how do you go from this place of not knowing what you don't know to [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1907.1399999999999s)]
*  being successful as a procurement manager at a small company that's rightly prioritizing their [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1913.78s)]
*  science and data? HOFFMAN Well, obviously as a procurement consultancy, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1920.74s)]
*  I'm going to say they should definitely go into this too. Yeah, that's not the only answer. I [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1926.18s)]
*  think there's a couple of things which every son should do when starting out. And the first is put [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1933.94s)]
*  in place some just simple but effective procurement tools. There are many, many different [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1938.9s)]
*  procurement digital solutions out there. They do tend to come and go pretty quickly. It's not [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1945.38s)]
*  always easy to choose the most appropriate one, but it's not necessary. Yeah. What's your favorite [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1952.66s)]
*  tool? Oh, very good question. I'm pretty much agnostic overall because different tools are [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1959.54s)]
*  right for different businesses. I guess the one which I have most experience of is Zip, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1966.42s)]
*  which is a great procurement orchestration tool, a very fast growing company. There are many others, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1971.62s)]
*  I would say, for full disclosure. But what you want is something which is no more complicated than [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1977.4599999999998s)]
*  needed to be. And so something that just means that when you're onboarding the supplier, when [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1984.4199999999998s)]
*  you're processing invoices and payments, when he was looking at contracts and so on, you just want [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1989.6999999999998s)]
*  everything to be as simple as possible to be in-bound plates and to be organized. Because [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=1995.46s)]
*  you do not want that Friday morning or five o'clock something has gone wrong and now we've got to [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2001.38s)]
*  source it. So just basic systems which don't actually expense it, don't actually become [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2006.26s)]
*  data which can be scales to match the size of your business. I'd say that's an absolute fundamental. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2013.22s)]
*  So anyone like Zip or any of the other companies, they will help with the protection package. So you [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2019.1399999999999s)]
*  don't have to do that work yourself. That I think will save you in so many other ways. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2026.82s)]
*  I mean, the other thing is just, I mean, there are many areas where you could simply do meet a [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2033.78s)]
*  specialist person. Again, office space, you could probably negotiate that. But it's easy to tie [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2039.7s)]
*  yourself in for very long leases without quite understanding the small print work. And it's easy [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2047.38s)]
*  to limit to leasing company vehicles for longer or for more money than you need to. So you just [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2054.82s)]
*  need to take careful steps and always try to get someone to, if it's an area you're well familiar [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2061.78s)]
*  with, find someone who's going to check it for you. All right. And yes, that could be consulted. It [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2067.78s)]
*  could be a part-time over long, but that probably could be helping at a more tactical level. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2073.46s)]
*  Where I think the biggest area of expense and complexity for early stage biotechs is the CRO [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2079.7s)]
*  relationship. And we all know how complex, how sensitive, how happy those relationships can be. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2086.82s)]
*  And yeah, that's where it is critical to understand what am I actually procuring within this? So as [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2097.2200000000003s)]
*  the sponsor, someone in the LTE and growing biotech, I've actually had a set of clinical [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2105.5400000000004s)]
*  trials. Yeah, I know what I'm doing. I know how to project that. I know how to add that to, [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2112.5s)]
*  yeah, we know what sort of sites we're looking for, what sort of patients we're looking for, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2118.1800000000003s)]
*  and all of those things. And they will then go and talk to a CRO. There are many different types [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2121.86s)]
*  of CRO relationships. They all have their different pros and cons and so on. So as a sponsor, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2127.78s)]
*  you've got to find the right CRO and then come to the right sort of agreement with them. But I just [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2133.0600000000004s)]
*  think it's essential that you have someone with a strategic procurement background behind that. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2138.7400000000002s)]
*  Because, okay, let's really go through, okay, and in detail, everything that might drive cost [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2145.54s)]
*  and value for both partners in this. And it needs to be someone who is not afraid to probe [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2152.74s)]
*  and to chariot both their own colleagues and the supplier until everyone fully understands [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2161.8599999999997s)]
*  everybody else's priorities and needs and perspectives. And that means you need a lot [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2169.14s)]
*  of what ifs in there as well. What if we don't manage to hit our improvement targets? What if [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2174.5s)]
*  we have to maybe change the protocol for some reason to the same point? What additional costs [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2181.14s)]
*  is that going to add? I think without a seasoned and experienced procurement person to look at it, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2185.3799999999997s)]
*  through that dispassionate lens, more scientific and non-business, okay, what do you need to really [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2195.78s)]
*  agree here? Without that, it is very easy to focus too much on price, not that from value, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2204.26s)]
*  and to get locked into no-term agreements that consume money without actually having to make [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2211.46s)]
*  a big deal out of it. Ultimately, I'd say, my parents were sheep farmers, sheep cattle farmers, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2216.1s)]
*  and one of my father's phrases was strong fences mid-good neighbors. So you really need to make [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2225.2999999999997s)]
*  sure that everything is clarified. Even if people go, I know this, I've done it before. Okay, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2231.22s)]
*  let's write it down anyway. Because without that, it's too easy to not make mistakes, but maybe not [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2237.14s)]
*  quite consider everything in the detail, which it needs to be considered in. You're talking about [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2245.94s)]
*  multi-year relationships with many, many millions of dollars behind them. You've got to get it right. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2251.46s)]
*  And that does mean that it's just expertise and experience. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2258.58s)]
*  You mentioned earlier in our conversation, the potential for locking in poor procurement practices [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2264.02s)]
*  at an early stage biotech company. And I wonder, clearly you don't want to spend any money that [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2271.86s)]
*  is unnecessary or wasteful as a growing early stage biotech company. Managing finances is such [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2278.5s)]
*  a critical piece of operations. But what kind of impact can that have, I guess, from an investor's [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2286.02s)]
*  point of view? Do you risk compounding failure on failure by making some poor [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2294.18s)]
*  procurement decisions early on when it comes to future fundraising? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2304.1s)]
*  Yeah, totally. That can definitely happen. So assuming you've got some funding, it could be [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2309.54s)]
*  over-aggressive. Your current funders want to see evidence that their funds are being used [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2316.98s)]
*  professionally and efficiently to drive the science and build a sound business. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2323.94s)]
*  And they don't want to see the funds being spent on it, which is unnecessary or [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2328.82s)]
*  inappropriate for truth. And in the same way, future investors want to see the company's been [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2335.78s)]
*  an effective steward of its previous funding and that it's likely to do so with future funding. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2340.98s)]
*  Because I think particularly in an environment where excess got more difficult, interest rates [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2346.82s)]
*  are just more volatile. And then operation efficiency, if you go back a few years to [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2352.7400000000002s)]
*  take us into more stable times, then investors would say, well, if I invest now, I'll sell out [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2362.5s)]
*  in five years' time. It's the science which everything with profit and value. That's no longer [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2366.9s)]
*  the case. So I think investors more and more are looking at the operational efficiency of their [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2372.98s)]
*  investors because that can have a big impact on future valuations, particularly in this very [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2380.26s)]
*  volatile world. Some of the bigger private equity firms have sometimes quite large value creation [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2385.62s)]
*  teams, which are there to help their investors improve operation effectiveness, build their [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2395.46s)]
*  supply chains, maybe down their procurement as well. But they have those teams to help their [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2401.94s)]
*  investors because they see it as being an important contributor to go to the higher future valuations. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2410.02s)]
*  That sort of value creation team approach is unfortunately much less commonly available, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2418.02s)]
*  actually, at the early stages of drugs. But I think every company really needs to think, [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2423.38s)]
*  how am I spending this much dollar? Could this be or should this be gained through my clinical [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2429.78s)]
*  trials or shouldn't we spend some gain myself at BMW and so forth? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2435.94s)]
*  Right. I wanted to ask too about sourcing. If you're looking for actinium for a radiopharmaceutical, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2442.6600000000003s)]
*  you're fairly limited, as you said, to a couple of providers they're expanding right now, but [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2453.86s)]
*  there are a number of different sources that different kinds of biotech companies need. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2458.98s)]
*  I wonder what you might say about the cutting edge of procurement as it relates to sourcing. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2466.7400000000002s)]
*  Are there different models, different innovative approaches to sourcing that you've experienced [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2474.82s)]
*  in your career or that you see emerging at this point? [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2481.7s)]
*  There are two really interesting areas. One is what I'd call innovative innovation. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2488.3399999999997s)]
*  Which is always worth thinking about is supplier diversity. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2494.1s)]
*  If we look at the first point, how do you look for innovation? If you always choose suppliers [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2497.54s)]
*  by going through the traditional RFI, RFP approach, reaching to the traditional suppliers, [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2504.2599999999998s)]
*  don't be surprised if you only get the traditional answers. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2510.58s)]
*  There are a whole range of techniques that you can use to go far beyond the traditional supply [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2514.74s)]
*  base and solutions that can bring you. It's an RFI request for information, RFP request for [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2520.2599999999998s)]
*  proposal. What would it get an RFO, which is a request for outcome? I guess a way that you [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2526.8199999999997s)]
*  can think of it is sometimes you know exactly what the estimation is going to look like. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2532.8199999999997s)]
*  You don't know really what the resolution is going to look like. Sometimes you don't know [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2537.7s)]
*  what the resolution is going to look like and you don't necessarily care what it looks like either. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2541.7s)]
*  Equally, sometimes you know exactly where your solution is going to come from [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2546.58s)]
*  and sometimes you don't know or care where it's going to come from. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2550.58s)]
*  If you know exactly what you're looking for and you know pretty much what sort of company [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2556.4199999999996s)]
*  it's going to come from, then just go to an RFP. I'd like to be a disabled. I want to please give [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2559.8599999999997s)]
*  them the best price and all that it took. If I know pretty much what I'm looking for, [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2565.78s)]
*  I don't know everywhere it comes from. Okay, RFI. I go to a wide group of companies and I say, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2571.78s)]
*  this is what I'm looking for. How much can you out in this area? Send me your outline, [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2578.26s)]
*  your capabilities. Now we're going to decide which one to go for. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2583.86s)]
*  So if I know what sort of supplier I'm going to be looking at, which part of the supply-based [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2587.86s)]
*  idea might come from, what solution I come from. But if I'm open to what that solution [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2596.26s)]
*  actually looks like, then go for an RFO. Explain your circumstances to your superior to say, [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2600.98s)]
*  help me solve this problem, but I'm not giving you any specific direction on what that solution [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2608.6600000000003s)]
*  might look like. We'll start getting broader ideas, but from the same group of suppliers. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2615.94s)]
*  But sometimes you say, I'm trying to solve the problem. I don't know what my solution is. I [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2622.58s)]
*  don't know where it's going to come from. So the sort of approach that is there is [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2628.34s)]
*  local innovation. I'll give you an example. I'll say this is from a large US pharma company. I [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2632.5s)]
*  won't name the name, but I was talking to one thing, Brown teams, and it's the classic [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2640.58s)]
*  conversation, but simply what keeps you awake? What business problem do you really have to solve? [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2646.8199999999997s)]
*  And they said, I've never met this drug. One of the things we love to be able to do is to assess [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2652.18s)]
*  cognitive performance more effectively, because cognitive performance can actually be an earlier, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2658.5s)]
*  better indicator of progression or what would have been that. So that's the disease than the [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2665.06s)]
*  usual tests of physical performance. But the problem is there'll be no advances in the way [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2671.3s)]
*  that we measure cognitive performance for 20, 30, maybe 40 years. And the current tests that [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2678.18s)]
*  repass it, so patients can actually learn how to do it, so we get artificially by school. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2685.14s)]
*  They take 14 words to be done. We have to do a more plentiful set and so on. So they're not [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2690.66s)]
*  great. And should it be the brand being said, wouldn't it be great if there was a way of assessing [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2696.66s)]
*  cognitive performance, which could be done by the patient themselves or maybe by the carer, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2704.2599999999998s)]
*  every day at home, take very good time to do it in a format which cannot be learned. So they [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2709.14s)]
*  can't get better at the tests by repeating them, which would produce data which is reasonably [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2715.22s)]
*  clinically robust and can be shared with their HOP or with their specialist. And of course, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2722.66s)]
*  there is no such solution. So we said, okay, let's see what we can do. We wrote up that [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2729.54s)]
*  problem statement, put it on an open innovation platform, or was it? In the center of the world. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2736.58s)]
*  And we put that challenge out there to 500 or 600,000 people around the world who had [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2743.94s)]
*  pre-registered as solvers on the open innovation platform. And within three months, we had about [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2749.2200000000003s)]
*  135 responses, of which 120 plus were completely useless and within very degrees, many of them [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2755.86s)]
*  were quite bad. But there were a handful, which you looked at, but actually that's a potentially [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2766.1s)]
*  useful idea. And we eventually drilled down to three submissions, all of which were workable. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2771.94s)]
*  One of the winning ones, we're at $10,000, 19, the winning one, as I remember, came from a 25-year-old [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2780.34s)]
*  grad student working in a real estate firm in the US. Another came from a retired mirror consultant [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2788.9s)]
*  Canada. And the third one was an 18-year-old Spanish student based in London. So each of these [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2795.7000000000003s)]
*  three solutions was completely workable. In fact, they've been developed further since, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2804.58s)]
*  but they all came from people who were so far outside any traditional supply base. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2810.1s)]
*  You couldn't imagine them being so good. But it's just about that by taking quite a structure, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2818.6600000000003s)]
*  deliberately wide range approach, we were able to put a problem or an issue that had not been [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2825.38s)]
*  solved or developed in decades and come up with radical workable submissions within three months. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2833.3s)]
*  I know that that's just one example of how if you plan it carefully, then you really can come up with [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2841.46s)]
*  genuinely distinctive and purposeful innovative solutions. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2852.18s)]
*  That's a great example. I had one follow-up I wanted to ask you on requests for outcome. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2857.94s)]
*  Is that a kind of tool that you're seeing more companies, I mean, is it a novelty at this point [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2865.46s)]
*  to send out a request for outcome or more companies actually doing that at this point? [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2871.2999999999997s)]
*  I guess it's more common in some areas than other. In, I guess, in their election trials, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2877.78s)]
*  for example, it's not that common though. I'm sure there are ways that it could be used. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2887.3s)]
*  But if you know there's something like marketing, then when you talk to your agency and say that [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2893.46s)]
*  I want to increase sales by 10% for I want to increase my market share by whatever. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2898.82s)]
*  And I'm not really sure what sort of program or campaign I'm looking at. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2904.5800000000004s)]
*  Go away and brainstorm something, come back. That effectively is an RFO. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2910.02s)]
*  So I'm not saying, I could say I want a 30-second TV ad which is going to cover the following [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2915.2200000000003s)]
*  explanation of clothes and will be broadcast on these channels at this time. Okay, that's [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2921.5400000000004s)]
*  pretty specific. But if I say that my target audience are 35 to 45 year olds, men who [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2926.34s)]
*  drive blue cars, wear yellow shirts and historically smoke too much. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2935.7000000000003s)]
*  I want to get them to change their, I want to sell more of their products and use them like buyers. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2941.2200000000003s)]
*  And I want to, the message I want to give them is, so what is the message which I want to give them [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2947.7000000000003s)]
*  to make that change in behavior? How can I get that message to them? I don't know. You're the [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2956.98s)]
*  kind of marketing agency you tell me. Matter of fact, that's an RFO. The skill is then taking [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2962.5s)]
*  that RFO idea and then applying it in other areas of what you do. It's never going to work [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2970.02s)]
*  for everything. And you need to know that you're going to be working with suppliers who you, [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2977.22s)]
*  to some extent, already know trust. Another approach is more sort of co-development [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2984.26s)]
*  goal or collaboration. But again, if I've got a supplier who I know well and I trust them and [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2991.38s)]
*  have an existing relationship with them, and I might work with them on a particular product [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=2996.9s)]
*  or service, I say let's build this together. And if it's successful, you'll obviously get paid for [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3003.0600000000004s)]
*  implementing liver index and I'll get the revenue, whatever it is. Then let's actually trust each [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3010.82s)]
*  other and work together to create something new. It's an extension of the RFO idea. It's not always [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3016.9s)]
*  going to be suitable. It won't be suitable for every supplier, but when the partnership is there [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3024.34s)]
*  and when the trust is there, it can really pay dividends. How far can you go, I wonder, in that [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3029.94s)]
*  direction? When you were just talking, it reminded me of value-based contracts, which some companies [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3036.66s)]
*  have started to work that essentially pay for outcomes. The health insurer will pay a certain [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3043.62s)]
*  amount if the drug takes the patient to the desired outcome and will get rebated if the drug does not [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3051.54s)]
*  take the patient to the outcome. I wonder to what extent that is happening, if at all, in other [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3058.5s)]
*  aspects of pharma operations. For example, going to a CRO and saying our outcome, our expected [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3065.22s)]
*  outcome is full recruitment by this date, this number of patients, and we're going to pay you [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3074.4199999999996s)]
*  this amount of money. But if you don't reach that, if we have to delay the trial start or you have [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3081.14s)]
*  problems with recruitment, then we get down to this next payment. Similarly with marketing [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3086.98s)]
*  services, I don't know what the metrics would be, but it could be a certain number of doctors [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3092.82s)]
*  are prescribing within a certain amount, whatever it is. Has it gone to that extent in procurement [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3097.6200000000003s)]
*  in terms of the supplier having some skin in the game? Yes, sure. It's more common in some areas [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3106.26s)]
*  than others. It's known as a pain share, game share, or bonus, or malice. The problems are, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3114.5800000000004s)]
*  and this is where I think it's a ticker problem in life sciences, biotech, because there are so [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3122.66s)]
*  many potential variables. If you can link the outcome directly to the supplier's performance, [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3130.2599999999998s)]
*  then great, they performed super well, they get bonus, they failed to perform, then they get [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3138.3399999999997s)]
*  some kind of clawback. But there are so many potential factors that could have an impact. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3143.7s)]
*  The supplier could perform wonderfully, but the drug sales are what you want because a competitor [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3152.5s)]
*  came out, because there was a new piece of data from another company. It could mean that there was [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3159.62s)]
*  a supply chain problem, which meant that there was a supply chain problem available. It could be that [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3166.18s)]
*  the sales source didn't get adequate breach. I think there are any one of many, many different [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3171.14s)]
*  factors that could either genuinely or just by claim enable the supplier to say, well, I took [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3176.98s)]
*  right out. The reason that the performance wasn't what was expected, it wasn't my fault. It was due [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3186.34s)]
*  to whatever other factors. Where you can genuinely cut out all these other factors and say there is [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3192.26s)]
*  a causal relationship between input and the fault. It's perfectly workable. If there are other factors [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3198.34s)]
*  which are just uncontrollable, unpredictable variables, it will be more difficult. I think [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3212.98s)]
*  that you see a lot of that in drug pricing. We can add with some examples of drug pricing. We'll [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3220.9s)]
*  take your drug, you'll get better, factorably more like it. Or even say, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3226.9s)]
*  prescribe the drug. If you reimburse the drug and the patient gets better, pay me at the end or pay [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3230.82s)]
*  me six months, the patient is still alive or whatever it might be. It was the patient's [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3238.02s)]
*  keeping function continuous to do risk. You pay me, which changes. You stop paying it. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3245.46s)]
*  Whatever the rates might be. If you can really pin down absolutely clear links of cause and effect, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3249.94s)]
*  but it is just so difficult to do that. I think that's why there was initially a lot of excitement [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3257.22s)]
*  about these value-based contracts, risk-based contracts. They didn't become as popular as I [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3264.26s)]
*  think people initially expected because of that complexity. Comorbidities, lifestyle, [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3271.22s)]
*  all sorts of inputs into the outcome that a drug can deliver that may not be able to be easily [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3278.74s)]
*  accounted for in a contract. I do believe that data is always going to get bigger, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3286.4199999999996s)]
*  but as our ability to process and first of all to accumulate and analyze data and then desacricate [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3294.2599999999998s)]
*  it, that is growing and growing every day. I do think that we will get to the point when it does [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3301.22s)]
*  become increasingly possible to link cause and effects despite the many variables of the [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3308.26s)]
*  background. Great. Well, we are running short on time here, Tom, but I want to give you just a [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3316.0200000000004s)]
*  chance before we wrap up. If there are any last final thoughts that you have on this topic that [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3322.0200000000004s)]
*  maybe you think are important that we haven't discussed, perhaps any advice you might have to [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3328.5s)]
*  biotech builders working in a WTF world at the moment where there is a lot of uncertainty just [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3334.66s)]
*  in terms of global economic policy, various conflicts around the world. What are your final [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3343.46s)]
*  thoughts in terms of what early-stage and mid-stage biotech companies can do to stay on the right foot [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3352.42s)]
*  with procurement or even use it to their advantage? There are some letters I would [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3360.9s)]
*  highlight and they're not VUCA and they're not WTS. What I would always try and highlight is that [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3368.02s)]
*  in the middle of the word procurement are the four letters C-U-R-E. I always do highlight them. I [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3374.02s)]
*  have them on my email signature picked out in a different font color. I think the message [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3382.26s)]
*  based for procurement people, but also for early-stage biotech is remember that if you [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3391.2200000000003s)]
*  enable and encourage your procurement team or procurement partner to be the best they can and [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3397.86s)]
*  to do the job that they can do, when the source and procurement functions are operating at its best, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3404.34s)]
*  we really can have as direct an impact on the patient as any other part of the function. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3412.1s)]
*  So I believe the cure is or should always be at the heart of what procurement does. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGkIs2WA5tI&t=3419.86s)]
