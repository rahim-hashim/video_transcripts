# Gene Therapy Manufacturing Advances With Aruvant CTO Dr. Palani Palaniappan
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 07, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM)
*  If you've been listening to the Business of Biotype podcast for a while now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=0.0s)]
*  you'll recall that Erin Harris has joined me to co-host a few episodes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3.44s)]
*  Erin's my friend, colleague, and chief editor over at sellandgene.com, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=7.2s)]
*  and she just recently launched a podcast of her own. It's aptly named Sell and Gene, the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And if you're working in the Sell and Gene space, you should give it a listen. It's a collection of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=17.04s)]
*  interviews with the industry and academic leaders moving the space forward. And you can find it at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=21.2s)]
*  sellandgene.com or anywhere you listen to podcasts. Sell and Gene, the podcast. Check it out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=25.68s)]
*  So as we said today, just four years after the first gene therapy was approved by the FDA here [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=40.24s)]
*  in the U.S., the gene therapy manufacturing story remains largely unwritten. It's an area of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  constantly new discovery and innovation, and that paints a beautiful landscape for discoverers [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=51.92s)]
*  and innovators like Dr. Palani Palaniapan, chief technology officer at Arruvant. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=57.92s)]
*  On today's episode of the Business of Biotech, we're taking a deep dive into the trend shaping [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=65.28s)]
*  the future of gene therapy manufacturing with Palani, a man who's led development and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=69.28s)]
*  manufacturing efforts at Gilead, Takeda, Sorepta, and now Arruvant. Joining Dr. Palani and I for [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=74.72s)]
*  the conversation is project pharma EVP, Tony Khoury, a longtime friend and contributor to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=81.84s)]
*  Bioprocess online and a bio pharma manufacturing Sherpa in his own right. Tony's contributed to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=87.04s)]
*  manufacturing operations and leadership roles at Bering El Ingerheim, Amgen, Sandoz, Gilead, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=92.64s)]
*  Avexis, and more. Dr. Palani and Tony, welcome to the show. Thanks for having us. It's great to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=98.56s)]
*  be here. Oh, it's great to have you guys. I appreciate the time you're taking to spend with [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  us. So let's rock and roll here. We have a lot of ground to cover. We chatted before the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=111.2s)]
*  before the recording. We've got a lot that we want to cover. So, Palani, I want to jump right in with [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=116.0s)]
*  you and ask why, you know, why manufacturing, more specifically manufacturing systems and processes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=120.64s)]
*  is so critical in gene therapy and where we are at this juncture? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=128.32s)]
*  Absolutely, Matt. It's a great question. Before I get there, let me just very briefly introduce, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=134.56s)]
*  you know, myself and my company. We are a gene therapy manufacturer for rare disorders, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=140.96s)]
*  and we focus on sickle cell disease to begin with and expanding the pipeline into other rare [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=147.6s)]
*  disorders. And it's great to be here today, and especially, you know, with Tony speaking and [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=153.6s)]
*  reminiscing with where gene therapy is going. Now, to address your question, why is this important? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=160.48s)]
*  You know, this time in gene therapy reminds me of late 80s and 90s, the inflection point in biologics [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=168.16s)]
*  therapeutics, you know, antibodies, proteins, a range of biologics options came into play for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=176.48s)]
*  patients in those time frame. And this feels like one of those inflection points in the industry [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=183.04s)]
*  where, you know, we get to address multiple types of diseases, rare disorders, genetic disorders, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=190.24s)]
*  in a range of diseases. I think that the important piece that we all have to acknowledge here is the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=198.0s)]
*  curative potential of gene therapy. When we talk about biologics, other therapeutics, it's only [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=205.36s)]
*  intervention. But at this point in time, we have, I think, enough evidence to say that gene therapies [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=211.52s)]
*  and cell therapies give you an opportunity to cure a disease. And that's the excitement. That's [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=218.08s)]
*  therein lies the reason why we feel the patients will benefit from it. And a lot of these options, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=224.0s)]
*  we had questions of our safety, but that seemed to be going away as well. These therapeutics that [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=230.96s)]
*  are coming out are generally appear to be safe and efficacious. And all it takes is one dose. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  Who would not like to have just one dose and cure a disease? And therein lies the reason why there [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=245.11999999999998s)]
*  is so much excitement. Just to give you a little bit of statistics, there's about 11,000, about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=250.64s)]
*  1100 or so companies now thinking about gene therapy. Billions of dollars are flowing into [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=257.52s)]
*  this space from venture capitalists, others who want to invest in this space. There's manufacturing [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=264.4s)]
*  activity happening all around. Companies are putting a ton of money in enhancing manufacturing [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=270.64s)]
*  capability capacity. Tony can talk to this a little bit more than I. I think there's so [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  much excitement simply because this is curative, it's safe, and there's all sorts of opportunities [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=284.88s)]
*  to treat and cure a range of diseases using these approaches. Tony, anything you want to add there? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=290.64s)]
*  Thanks, Lonnie. It's great to see you. Where to begin, it's a very critical time right now. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=299.36s)]
*  You hit the nail on the head. We're humbled. All of us are privileged to be a part of the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=307.44s)]
*  advanced medicine space, the therapeutic revolution. And with that, there's so much [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=311.68s)]
*  beautiful science out there that we need to mobilize. And in order to do that, we have to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=317.36s)]
*  continue to evolve and further on with how we progress the science and the technology. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=322.32s)]
*  Looking at a few of these diseases that have now been cured and being humbly a part of it, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=330.8s)]
*  seeing the Zolgensma, Zs-Cardas, the Kimrayas, and Buxturna, they're beautiful stories. And we're [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=336.48s)]
*  not just saving lives, we're creating lives because now those patients can have families or [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=344.48s)]
*  further on their families. And it's truly humbling to be a part of it. From a manufacturing [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=350.72s)]
*  book, we've had tons of clinical trials. It's continuing to grow year over year. We've seen [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=357.44000000000005s)]
*  the investment, we've seen the science pre-clinical, clinical continue to grow. Well, what we keep [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=361.68s)]
*  forgetting about is now everything's going to progress into commercial. And we've had a handful [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=366.96000000000004s)]
*  of commercial products move forward with many more in the pipeline as we continue to see clinical [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=370.72s)]
*  success. And so companies continue to plan for success. We need to plan for success as an [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=376.08s)]
*  organization. And we really need to be able to address the manufacturing options out there and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=381.44s)]
*  find solutions that would meet and do justice to the great science that we have and the therapeutic [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=387.76s)]
*  revolutions that we see. Yeah. I'm curious to get both of your perspectives on something that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=393.44s)]
*  you mentioned, Dr. Palani, around sort of the parallel between biologics back in the 80s [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=399.44s)]
*  and now where we are, you know, the inflection point that you see happening in gene therapy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=406.24s)]
*  If you kind of took those two chronologies and laid them over one another, like this inflection [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  point in biologics back in the 80s and where we are today that kind of correlates with that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=417.68s)]
*  in gene therapy, the trajectory of the manufacturing challenge or the curve, I should say, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=423.2s)]
*  of the manufacturing challenge, do you see a steeper curve for gene therapy where we are right [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=429.2s)]
*  now than where we were at sort of a parallel time in biologics because of the complexity and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=435.04s)]
*  you know, the, I guess, lot to lot consistency and some of the major challenges that we face. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=441.04s)]
*  Do you see a steeper curve right now than we had back then? It's a wonderful question. I think you [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  touched on this point very well in that the expectations of people who have diseases changed, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=453.28000000000003s)]
*  right? People expect immediate cure. You know, we've seen cancer explode in an exponential [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=461.52s)]
*  fashion in the population, so people want answers. So because of that, I think the curve is, in fact, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  steeper than what we saw in the 80s and 90s because remember, in the 80s and 90s, we had time, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=476.08s)]
*  you know, we had technologies that we had to build. We had to build manufacturing plans. We had to [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=482.47999999999996s)]
*  build these 25,000-liter tanks where we produce these proteins. We don't have that time anymore [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=488.16s)]
*  because these diseases are, you know, cropping up in a very quick fashion and people expect solutions [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=494.96000000000004s)]
*  and clearly the curve is steeper and I think we are also responding to that, responding to those [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=503.04s)]
*  expectations better these days because our technology base has evolved as well from the 80s and 90s. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=511.12s)]
*  So I think we have better tools. We have better solutions and we have great quality people coming [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=517.12s)]
*  into this space as well. I think that sort of makes a difference in sort of saying, yes, the curve is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=523.04s)]
*  steeper but I think we can react to that steepness even, you know, better than what we did in the 80s [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=529.12s)]
*  and 90s. That's my response. I don't know what you think about that, Tony, but that's... [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=536.08s)]
*  Now I think it was well put, Balani. I mean, it's there. It's deep. The urgency is key, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=540.5600000000001s)]
*  right? I mean, this is... Patients are passing away. There's no other options. There's no treatments. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, 10 plus years ago, 15 years ago, we only dreamed. We had devastating stories, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=552.7199999999999s)]
*  people dying of cancer, people dying of genetic diseases, make them comfortable and enjoy the time [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=557.28s)]
*  you have and now we have hope, we have cures, we have miracle medicines, miracle stories. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=562.7199999999999s)]
*  So the urgency is there and we can't just say there's no technology for, you know, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=568.4799999999999s)]
*  we need to find solutions. And I mean, working with, you know, connected with Balani five plus [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=573.36s)]
*  years ago and working with some of the first ever cell and gene therapies to ever be commercially [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=578.32s)]
*  improved, you know, our motto was egos at the door, be solution driven. So find it out, make [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=581.92s)]
*  it quality compliant, make sure that we're safe. The, you know, profiles are there but let's find [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=589.28s)]
*  solutions. Let's do justice to the, you know, families and the patients that are out there that [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=595.52s)]
*  need this help. You know, I mean, those are the words that founded Project Pharma when we started [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=601.44s)]
*  rock and rolling, the words are patient focused. That's where the PF for Project Pharma came from. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=606.24s)]
*  And we were like, hey, if we're going to embark on this journey, we want to do right. And we want to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=610.6400000000001s)]
*  find solutions and move this medicine forward because, you know, if that was any one of us, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=614.72s)]
*  I would hope that people would work hard and care and want to deliver. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  All right. So I want to get your perspectives on scale up and kind of get into the meat of the [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=624.5600000000001s)]
*  manufacturing discussion. I've had, you know, as you guys know, I spend a lot of time talking with [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=631.36s)]
*  the leaders of emerging biopharmas and more specifically, many leaders of emerging cell and [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=636.96s)]
*  gene therapies. And, you know, there seems to be, you know, not a whole lot of middle ground [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=641.76s)]
*  between the folks who say, look, there's no way that we can outsource what we're trying to accomplish [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=648.32s)]
*  here in the development of our therapeutic because it's that complicated and we want that in-house [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  mastery. And then there's the other side of the spectrum who's like, you know, you have to be crazy [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=659.36s)]
*  to try to do this stuff in-house in today's day and age. There's so much CDMO capacity and knowledge [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=664.4s)]
*  out there to leverage. And, you know, there's the whole cost consideration. So it's like a big [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=671.6800000000001s)]
*  dichotomy. It always surprises me, folks who are just convicted on one side of that or the other. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=678.72s)]
*  Tony, what do you think? I mean, what's your take on, you know, whether therapeutic developers will, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=684.4799999999999s)]
*  you know, are better off to scale up internally or leverage CDMOs or some sort of combination? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=689.52s)]
*  What does the future look like there? Yeah, I appreciate the question, Matt. And it's a question [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=695.36s)]
*  that will continue to be a critical one for innovators. I don't think it's going to... [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=699.76s)]
*  All day, every day, I feel like that's all I do is evaluate that with, you know, innovators [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=704.9599999999999s)]
*  and lead our strategy group that does that. And I like to break it out into like two buckets. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=709.36s)]
*  And one is a quantitative assessment. And the other one's a qualitative assessment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=714.48s)]
*  Quantitatively, there's the financial benefits and upfront capital and cash flows and commitment [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=719.4399999999999s)]
*  plans and what's your return on investment and how many years are you breaking even point. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=724.4s)]
*  Sorry to go fast, but you can see me do it all day. But qualitatively, it's like, okay, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=728.24s)]
*  control over your manufacturing, control over your fate. What are those lines really [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=733.04s)]
*  mean? And sometimes we just say those general lines, but we don't really understand what they [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=738.48s)]
*  mean. And the fact of the matter is, and Pallani knows this, and so do you, Matt, like there's so [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=742.0s)]
*  many unknowns when we're first trying to move a product forward. Preclinical, we have 20 some [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  products or early phase clinicals. We don't know the yields. We don't know what scale we're going [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=752.72s)]
*  to produce it. We don't know the dosing volumes yet. And all of these are key items into determining [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=757.36s)]
*  how much manufacturing, how much GMP material we need to progress through clinicals and then [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=763.52s)]
*  position ourselves properly for pivotal and commercial manufacturing. So we have to put [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=769.1999999999999s)]
*  assumptions in. And those assumptions, I'll tell you just to assure everybody, they won't be right. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=774.56s)]
*  They're going to move around. It's okay. But we need to put something in and then take that [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=779.6s)]
*  forward from there. And so based on those inputs and those critical assumptions, you make a strategy [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=784.16s)]
*  and a plan. More times than not, it's very rare that I work with an innovator or pharma company [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=789.04s)]
*  that says, you know, I have two years. I can get manufactured in a couple of years. It's almost [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=794.56s)]
*  always, and Pallani knows this, it's like, I need something ASAP. So more times than not, to build a [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=799.68s)]
*  facility day one is going to be challenging. You need to partner with a good company, a good CDMO, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=804.9599999999999s)]
*  but you also need to make a full-on strategy. And for someone like me, like living and breathing [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=812.4s)]
*  the tech ops world for my whole career, it's very interesting because the last five, six years [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=817.2s)]
*  being pulled in as early as private equity investment level, we haven't formulated the [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=823.6s)]
*  company. That's how important this decision is. They want a manufacturing strategy before they [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=827.44s)]
*  even create the company or invest in a company, or when they've invested only have a handful of [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=831.76s)]
*  folks like the AVEXA story, the Humbly Be A Part of, we were figuring out that plan so early in [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=835.84s)]
*  its infancy of the organization. So with that in mind, that shows you how early we need to plan. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=841.12s)]
*  So it's kind of like you need to put out the fire in day one and then you need to make the [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=846.4s)]
*  overall plan so you're preventative for the whole company with inputs that are moving around. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=849.1999999999999s)]
*  So it would behoove you to evaluate that quantitatively and qualitatively because when [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=853.92s)]
*  things do move around, can you adjust or is it hard to do that with a partner? Could you turn on [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=859.1999999999999s)]
*  those burners or run another lot if you need to or bring on more material or adjust the process [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=864.16s)]
*  so that you can get proper scaling and yields? There's a lot of things to take into consideration [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=871.2s)]
*  and those are inputs. And then from a manufacturing side, people always just think manufacturing, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=877.44s)]
*  but I want to just highlight to the team, there's analytical development, there's process [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=883.12s)]
*  development, there's manufacturing, quality controls, warehousing, supply chain and logistics, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=887.6s)]
*  right? And critical long leads across the entire breadth. So when we say the word manufacturing, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=894.4000000000001s)]
*  we're genericizing all the subcategories of analytical development, process development, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=899.6s)]
*  warehousing, cold storage, manufacturing, quality control testing that all needs to be assessed [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=904.0s)]
*  across both those two groups. It's a good consideration. I appreciate you bringing that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=909.28s)]
*  up, Tony, because yeah, I mean, it's easy to overlook that. It's easy to just say, oh, you know, [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=914.8000000000001s)]
*  CDMO, just manufacturing outsourcer. We're not, you know, right. We'll make our product. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=918.64s)]
*  And we plan, he's had tons of experience, you know, managing the largest external solution in [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=924.1600000000001s)]
*  the space and gene therapy and, you know, as well as leading and building out capability internally. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=928.24s)]
*  And, you know, we always keep ourselves disciplined, right? It's not just manufacturing. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=933.12s)]
*  We got to think about all these other buckets, right? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=937.52s)]
*  I think this also goes back to the previous question Matt was asking about the steepness [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=941.52s)]
*  of the curve, right? I think the expectations are through the roof and people need solutions. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=946.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, remember building manufacturing plant and bringing it online takes 24 to 36 to 48 [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=952.7199999999999s)]
*  months, depending on who's doing it, where you are doing it, what regulatory considerations you need [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=960.16s)]
*  to bring in house and things like that. So you don't have oftentimes that amount of time. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=965.52s)]
*  So the question is, what's the next solution? You know, obviously the best solution is to [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=972.0799999999999s)]
*  have your destiny in your hand, build your facility, put in the money and all of that. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=976.88s)]
*  But oftentimes you tend to settle down on the next best solution is to go to the external vendor [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=982.48s)]
*  and you pick the best one that you can find and get the solution going for the patients. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=990.08s)]
*  And that's what happens oftentimes in these smaller companies. And remember, many of us are [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=997.04s)]
*  limited by the resources, right? We are coming into this with a focus on innovation and you can [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1003.6s)]
*  only do so much for a hundred million dollars, right? If I had the big pharma approach and the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1009.84s)]
*  muscle behind me, I can do a lot of different things. Even big farmers these days, they're not [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1017.0400000000001s)]
*  taking that approach, but in a small environment with a steeper curve and the expectation through [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1021.9200000000001s)]
*  the roof, you often look for those hybrid solutions that Tony was talking about earlier. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1027.84s)]
*  I think that's where many of us are at this point in time. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1034.6399999999999s)]
*  And just, sorry, real quick, Matt, pop in there is hybrid solution will happen. There's going to be [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1039.76s)]
*  more phased appropriate builds. So we've been seeing that and we've been recommending that a [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1045.52s)]
*  lot because of these moving inputs, right? You know, maybe you take 150,000 or 200,000 square foot [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1050.32s)]
*  facility, but you only build out phases. And then also with the CDMO, you partner in phases. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1056.96s)]
*  So I think phase strategy will definitely continue. But yeah, it's going to be a critical [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1062.48s)]
*  decision and de-risking that with a hybrid solution will be valuable. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1067.68s)]
*  Palani, can you give us sort of a snapshot of where Aruvant is in that journey? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1073.76s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Thanks for the question. You know, just to back up a little bit, I think [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1080.0s)]
*  we are a small company and we are part of Ryvand family of companies. And so the resources are in [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1085.2s)]
*  some ways unlimited for us because we have the backing from Ryvand. But that said, you know, [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1092.96s)]
*  we are focused on two disease paradigms today. So we are focused on sickle cell disease. As you know, [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1097.92s)]
*  sickle has been a much ignored disease paradigm for a long period of time in our society. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1106.72s)]
*  More recently, in the last 10 or so years, a number of companies are working on it. And we are [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1113.84s)]
*  in the mix of that. And we believe that we have a differentiated approach to be able to tackle that [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1118.72s)]
*  issue for the population. So our program is advancing to pivotal stage next year. We are [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1124.56s)]
*  in phase one, two trial. We have a few patients worth of data. Our program is in a place where we [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1132.08s)]
*  think, you know, we like our chances. Let me put it that way. You know, we have a hemoglobin, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1138.88s)]
*  anti-sickling hemoglobin, which is much differentiated from what others have. And we [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1146.24s)]
*  have a conditioning regimen, which is very, very, you know, low intensity conditioning regimen, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1151.0400000000002s)]
*  unlike the others who use bucell fan, which is a painful way to deal with conditioning of bone [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1156.72s)]
*  marrow. We also have a proprietary process. As Tony mentioned earlier, we have spent a lot of [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1164.16s)]
*  time thinking about our manufacturing process, such that we can maintain the stemness of the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  cells that we extract from these patients. So those three things combined puts us in a great place [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1175.2s)]
*  from a process analytics, from an efficacy safety standpoint. The next question is, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1181.92s)]
*  how do you translate that into manufacturing paradigm for a larger number of patients, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1187.8400000000001s)]
*  for global patients, et cetera, et cetera? And we are thinking through that. In fact, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1193.36s)]
*  the approach we have taken as this hybrid approach of hiring people internally, we have hired a number [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1198.24s)]
*  of people who are experts in this space, people who came from developing products from Adjuno, [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1203.9199999999998s)]
*  Novartis, Seraptor, and other places where they've done a lot of work on GeneTap. And we've [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  hired those people. So these people internally develop the process for us, analytics for us. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1218.08s)]
*  And then our idea would be to contract the team type of manufacturing, GMP testing type of activities [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1224.48s)]
*  to partners, you know, companies like Lanza and Devron help us in that regard. So that's what [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1232.48s)]
*  we are looking at. So and again, it's, as Tony said, it's not a one size fits all answer to this. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1239.52s)]
*  And in fact, we have a second program, which is called Hypofasphosphatasia program. This is a bone [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1249.36s)]
*  disorders, these babies who are born with that, and Tony knows this very well, working with [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1255.68s)]
*  Vaxxas on SMA. These babies, if you don't treat them, don't grow into even infants. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1261.52s)]
*  So in that regard, the second program we have is an exciting program, and we are looking at various [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1269.36s)]
*  ways to do manufacturing for that. But again, the long answer short, this is a process in evolution, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1275.84s)]
*  and we're going to look at everything in our power. If we have to put up a small [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1284.72s)]
*  footprint of manufacturing, we will look at it. But majority of this is going to be in a hybrid [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1289.76s)]
*  format, you know, get the internal resources aligned through the higher value activities, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1295.76s)]
*  creating IP, etc, etc. And try to get the routine type of activities outsourced, such that, you know, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1302.32s)]
*  you can you can have the best of the both, you know, both words, if you want to say it that way. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1309.52s)]
*  So yeah, yeah. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1314.96s)]
*  Bonnie, that's really interesting hearing that strategy around bringing in the talent. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  I really like that. So, as you know, Matt, but, you know, PF, we've managed over 4 billion in [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1322.5600000000002s)]
*  capital last four years, right, in manufacturing. So we're laying out the strategy next week. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1328.5600000000002s)]
*  And one criteria when we're evaluating whether it's internal, actually doesn't matter, we lay [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1335.0400000000002s)]
*  out the plan, ignite external, build internal, do both. Evaluating the team's talent. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1338.72s)]
*  Is a great, you know, indicator, if you will. So it's, okay, do I have the capability? Should [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1345.0400000000002s)]
*  I build internally? Or do I have to bring in all that talent on its own? So I really like the fact [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1351.5200000000002s)]
*  that your organization is, you know, looking at ways to bring in that talent. So should you be [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1357.44s)]
*  provided that capability or that technology, that platform, you can actually use that, [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1362.72s)]
*  you know, tool, if you will, to manufacture what you need. So really, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1367.7600000000002s)]
*  yeah, that's a, Tony, I'll take that opportunity to throw a little plug out. You, not too long ago, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1372.8s)]
*  you and I, and your CEO, Anshul Mogul, sat down and did a talent crunch roundtable. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1380.24s)]
*  Listeners who are listening to this on the Bioprocess Online website right now, you're [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1389.04s)]
*  only a couple clicks away from that very informative program as well that talks about [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1393.3600000000001s)]
*  overcoming your talent challenges. So check that out. All right. Plug aside. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1398.08s)]
*  Alani, I wanted to ask you about something you mentioned just a few minutes ago in your response [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1406.72s)]
*  to the, you know, in-source, outsource question, and that's the regulatory landscape. So, you know, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1412.08s)]
*  depending on your perspective, that's a limiting or enabling pressure on gene therapy development. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1417.1999999999998s)]
*  I think the word that most often is referenced or used in conversations with leaders of gene [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1425.52s)]
*  therapy companies around the regulatory scene right now is dialogue, you know, collaborative. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1431.84s)]
*  What's your perspective? Where are you now on the regulatory path and what does that regulatory [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1439.04s)]
*  path look like? From my understanding, it's sort of unfolding before our very eyes. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1445.2s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. You know, I'm going to be a little bit of a contrarian [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1449.76s)]
*  to answer that question. You know, if you ask a general answer to that question, people are going [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1454.9599999999998s)]
*  to say, hey, regulatory landscape is changing tremendously. And so you've got to react to it [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1459.6799999999998s)]
*  and so on and so forth. In fact, my position on this is the regulatory landscape is not changing [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1465.28s)]
*  at all. You know, we are interested in safe drugs for a long period of time. It doesn't matter small [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1471.6s)]
*  molecule biologics, antibody drug conjugates, microbiome, doesn't really matter. We want any [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1477.92s)]
*  external agent that comes into intervene in a disease setting. We want it to be safe. We want [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1484.16s)]
*  it to be efficacious and we want people having diseases derive benefit from this external agent. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1490.24s)]
*  That position has not changed at all. In fact, if you go back to talk to the regulators these days [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1496.4s)]
*  with your gene therapy, which I've been part of many of these regulatory meetings, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1502.4s)]
*  the primary concern there is, is your agent safe? Is it efficacious? You know, can you measure the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1506.96s)]
*  dose? Can you show that you can control the process? All of those things are the same. So that said, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1512.8s)]
*  you know, my point in all of this is that, you know, end of the day, we have to have that dialogue [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1520.56s)]
*  with the regulators to be able to say, you know, what we say in terms of the quality of the product [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1528.24s)]
*  identity of the product, the impurity levels in this product. And I would even venture out to say, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1534.72s)]
*  we have to be even more careful because some of these impurities, we don't have the technologies [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1543.68s)]
*  to measure them yet. And these are genetic material, these are small quantities. And we got [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1548.4s)]
*  to be able to find those tools in our toolbox to be able to measure these things. And then I think [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1554.72s)]
*  we're going to be in a great position from a regulatory perspective. I think that's going [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1560.0s)]
*  to be the key theme. And we know what genetic material, genetic changes can do for, you know, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1565.8400000000001s)]
*  pharmacologically in our system. So we just have to be careful about that. From that perspective, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1572.96s)]
*  I maintain that in fact, the regulatory landscape is evolving. I wouldn't call it a change, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1578.24s)]
*  but we just have to take it off our business end of the day. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1585.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1587.84s)]
*  Tony, you want to go ahead? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1588.8s)]
*  Well said, Balani. I think you're right. Fundamentally, we're there. Interaction [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1590.8799999999999s)]
*  with the agency is critical, Matt. Like you had, you know, collaboration and, you know, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1595.44s)]
*  upfront discussion, whether it's your CMC strategy, your regulatory strategy, your clinical studies, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1600.6399999999999s)]
*  and clinical strategy, right? But, and look, the agency wants us to be successful, right? They want [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1605.6799999999998s)]
*  to collaborate, especially with the meaningfulness behind this. You know, if you zoom out and think [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1612.08s)]
*  about the industry, how did we get to where we are today? And Balani, I've had many chats around [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1618.56s)]
*  this, but like we started out with therapeutic revolution, right? We started out with ultra rare [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1623.04s)]
*  orphan disease, incurable diseases, devastating, life-ending diseases, no other option, no other, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1628.6399999999999s)]
*  you know, potential care solutions out there. We've really done a great job. We're starting [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1636.56s)]
*  to prove that out, whether it's, you know, through the muscular dystrophies, the different types of [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  derivations of cancer or, you know, different types of blood disorders. Now we're getting into [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1646.1599999999999s)]
*  these chronic treatments, right? And we're trying to find ways to cure these chronic treatments. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1650.72s)]
*  And we're evolving, right? Society is getting comfortable with this, right? The regulators are [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1655.36s)]
*  getting comfortable with this. And so the patients have hope. Now we're moving into the chronic [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1659.44s)]
*  treatment and eventually we're going to get into more pain management type of solutions, all using, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1663.84s)]
*  you know, cutting edge technology. So I think aggression is happening. And with that increases [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  the patient population, right? Ultra rare orphan disease, you know, hundreds of patients, thousands, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1675.4399999999998s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of millions, it'll come. And I think we've shown that in the regulatory pathway [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1682.0s)]
*  also, you know, they're getting more comfortable with how we approve this and [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1689.7600000000002s)]
*  long-term data as plenty highly. Yeah. If I, if I may add one more thing to that discussion, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1693.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, earlier paradigm is, you know, you, you go test the drug in multiple countries, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  multiple populations, hundreds of patients, you know, often thousands of patients. That's not the [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1706.16s)]
*  case anymore. You know, we test these drugs in, you know, several tens of patients and, you know, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1712.88s)]
*  sometimes hundreds of patients. So really there's an obligation on our part to be able to say that [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1718.72s)]
*  the success that you see in this early clinical population translate into commercial population. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1724.0s)]
*  And again, the idea is how do you manufacture in, in scale for these patients in, in that scale that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1729.6000000000001s)]
*  we talked about, you know, several hundreds of patients, perhaps in a commercial setting, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1737.2800000000002s)]
*  regulate, you know, regulatory conversation in that regard, you know, how do you validate your [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1741.6s)]
*  process? How do you set up the supply chain? Things like that becomes critical, you know, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1745.9199999999998s)]
*  going forward. And diagnostics, right? Proper analytics. Exactly. That's a key one that [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1751.36s)]
*  needs to be, you know, can progress along the time. So yeah. Tony, what, what manufacturing [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1757.6799999999998s)]
*  technologies are you seeing sticking right now? What, you know, kind of want to shift that [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1764.72s)]
*  conversation to the, to the tech that's, that's being deployed and that's, I guess, being adopted [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1771.1200000000001s)]
*  and accepted as we kind of work through the manufacturing challenges that we're facing. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1778.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. I mean, they've continued to progress on their own, right? But, you know, [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1783.44s)]
*  prefabricated modular clean rooms, right? I think that'll continue to stay and be a value [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1790.0s)]
*  or just kind of, you know, standard stick-built designs that can be modulated, scaled out, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1797.04s)]
*  single use technology or disposable technology. I think that's really valuable to avoid, you know, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1803.68s)]
*  the upfront effort related to the scheme in place, clean in place, you know, needs. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1808.24s)]
*  So those are there. Also the, you know, other manufacturing benefits of, of like speed, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1813.1200000000001s)]
*  fewer resources, smaller footprint upfront costs related to that. I think that's going to continue [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1819.44s)]
*  to stick and then it will continue to progress. But you look, we worked with some of the first [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1826.72s)]
*  ever adhesion suspension technologies in the space. We worked with some of the first ever [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1831.28s)]
*  modular clean rooms in the space. We actually built out the largest footprint for one of the [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1835.2s)]
*  vendors, all modular, you know, clean rooms. And I will say five years ago to now, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1839.68s)]
*  totally different in a good way, right? They've really done a great job of hearing the voice of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1846.24s)]
*  the customer. Lonnie and I sat down with them and said, Hey, these are really good things. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1850.8799999999999s)]
*  These are areas of improvement. And, you know, the technology, the equipment's technology inside, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1855.84s)]
*  like there's a science technology, there's a manufacturing equipment technology has continued [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1862.16s)]
*  to improve. You streamline some of that. And now that those offerings, although they still are [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1865.84s)]
*  growing and it's fun to hear that like folks, you know, have their feedback on different technology [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1872.56s)]
*  and I can say should have seen it five years ago. I'm better now, right? And it will continue to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1878.8799999999999s)]
*  improve. I think those are the understandings. The business of biotech is brought to you in [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1884.6399999999999s)]
*  partnership with SITIVA. Together, we're committed to helping the leaders of new and emerging [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1890.3999999999999s)]

*  useful resources for biotech leaders at SITIVA's emerging biotech accelerator at [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1907.2s)]
*  SITIVA life sciences.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C Y T I V A life sciences.com [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1912.88s)]
*  backslash emerging biotech. What's been the scene over at Arun Vand Palani? What [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1922.64s)]
*  manufacturing technologies, I guess, since you've been there or, you know, shortly before that [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1931.6s)]
*  you've adopted as you've ironed out manufacturing issues, what's sort of been instrumental or game [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1936.32s)]
*  changing? Oh, yes, absolutely. That's a great question. I think we are in a very unique position [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1943.04s)]
*  because we are using, you know, both, you know, a lentivirus based, you know, modification of the [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1949.4399999999998s)]
*  artologous cells for the sickle cell disease. And on the other side of the paradigm, we are also [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1956.56s)]
*  using, I don't know, associated virus as a way to inject these virus particles carrying the trans [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1961.9199999999998s)]
*  gene in vivo. So we are testing both approaches in our programs. And that said, you know, I think one [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1968.72s)]
*  of the areas that we are very carefully evaluating is, you know, this idea of how to grow these cells [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1977.12s)]
*  to make, you know, a lot of virus particles, you know, just going back to keeping it qualitative. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1985.28s)]
*  You know, each of these cells, we call them the embryonic kidney cells. And these cells [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1992.3999999999999s)]
*  take up the trans gene and take up the other genes and make the virus particles and the virus [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=1999.28s)]
*  particles contain the trans gene that produces the protein that you're interested in at the end of [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2004.16s)]
*  the day. And so we are looking at ways of enhancing to produce more virus particles [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2008.88s)]
*  carrying the right trans gene. What does that, you know, how does that matter? You know, you have more [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2015.44s)]
*  virus particle carrying the trans gene, you have to use less of them to, you know, as a dose, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2021.3600000000001s)]
*  you know, more virus particles as a dose creates problem because it's foreign, you know, your liver [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  has to work overtime to clear them. So lesser dose is better. So that's one area of interest for us. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2035.28s)]
*  You know, can you produce more? Can you, you know, decrease the cost of goods for the patient? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2041.84s)]
*  Remember, each of these doses going to come at a premium price. And we've seen that throughout [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2047.6s)]
*  the industry. And so our goal would be to, can we decrease the cost of goods? Can you make these [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2053.04s)]
*  things, you know, highly pure? And can you reduce the dose such that you don't have to create safety [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2058.64s)]
*  issues for these patients? Those are some of the areas we are interested in our shop to be able to [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2065.2s)]
*  identify solutions such that it can carry forward with these things, you know, keeping [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2070.96s)]
*  or increasing the efficacy, but decreasing the safety, you know, risk for the patients. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2077.4399999999996s)]
*  Yeah. Tony, what... [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2084.56s)]
*  But, you know, I think there's, we can get into details if you like, but that's just a [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2087.3599999999997s)]
*  qualitative way of looking at it. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. I'm curious where you both say, I was going to [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2091.84s)]
*  ask Tony, as he sort of reflects on your response, Balani, based on his experience working with [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2099.04s)]
*  several gene therapy companies across the board, what your thoughts are and where we're going from [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2104.1600000000003s)]
*  here? What needs to get better? You know, more specifically, what needs to, you know, where we [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2111.28s)]
*  identified opportunities or room for improvement that's going to be necessary to move the ball [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2115.36s)]
*  forward? And Dr. Palanin Appian, you're welcome to chime in on that as well. What's the next step [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2120.88s)]
*  in terms of making things better? We got a lot to do, Matt. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2128.48s)]
*  But we're moving towards it. I guess where to begin, I think, you know, planning it on it from [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2136.96s)]
*  a yield perspective, right? From a science maturity and trying to have better yields, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2143.2000000000003s)]
*  those better yields will result in, you know, higher, you know, less batches, less footprint, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2148.64s)]
*  better throughput. I think that'd be a great one. And looking at our technology and, you know, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2154.4s)]
*  we talk about all these different single use that I brought up earlier and modular. Well, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2162.08s)]
*  now the disposables are becoming long weed. And we have these long weeds that we talked about five [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2167.68s)]
*  years ago to now. And then we have a category called new long weeds. Basically, we got single [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2173.44s)]
*  use disposables or filters and vials that are almost becoming equal to or greater than the lead [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2178.96s)]
*  time of a piece of equipment. And so we have to find ways to understand how the supply chain is [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2185.36s)]
*  continuing to ripple effect down and create more lead times. And that all comes with better [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2190.56s)]
*  forecasting. I think if we give our suppliers and I call them partners, you know, I think everybody's [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2197.84s)]
*  a partner. Everything we do takes a team and a huge industry movement. We give them a forecast [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2203.28s)]
*  of what we really need. I think that they'll have more confidence in scaling up and scaling out, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2210.0s)]
*  if you will, so that they can service that. So we definitely need to do that better. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2215.28s)]
*  Talent wise is bottleneck for sure. You know, we're doing a good job investing in universities and [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2219.1200000000003s)]
*  trying to find ways. Training talent is a very unique creature, if you ask, you know, my perspective, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2225.52s)]
*  like you could teach someone they may remember, right? But if you involve them, they'll truly [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2233.36s)]
*  learn, right? And so from my perspective, I think having apparatuses and having different [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2239.84s)]
*  solutions out there that allow, you know, university students or early phase training [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2245.84s)]
*  to physically touch systems and run equipment and be in the middle of it all, that could really [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2250.64s)]
*  help the talent bottleneck. And, you know, bottom line is we have a boom in the space and we have [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2255.6s)]
*  limited talent. So we've got to find ways to increase that and level out that discrepancy there. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2260.64s)]
*  So, you know, just a few things. And of course, the technology menu, you know, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2266.08s)]
*  more automation, maybe more closed systems. I think we're doing a good job, but we definitely [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2269.68s)]
*  need to standardize things more and continue to progress on that forefront. I think that would [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2275.2799999999997s)]
*  bring a lot of value to the space. And right now these processes are very manual. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2278.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2284.8s)]
*  It's almost like a glorified lab. You know, Plani knows this, Matt, like, and if we can find ways [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2286.32s)]
*  to automate it, close those systems up more. And, you know, I always say mitigate your integration [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2291.36s)]
*  points. So all this equipment that's on the floor, integrating it to a, you know, supervisory control [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2296.64s)]
*  system. And I'm a controls engineer by trade in the beginning of my life. So I won't geek out too [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2302.32s)]
*  much, but finding ways to have everything be more standardized and less custom integration, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2306.96s)]
*  which results in custom testing, which extends lead times. And I think that would really benefit [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2312.8s)]
*  the space. I like the phrase mitigate your interfaces or integration points. That's a [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2317.92s)]
*  fantastic way to say that because there are so many steps in this manufacturing, relatively speaking, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2327.04s)]
*  right? In a small molecule biologic setting versus this one. If you don't mind, I would like [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2334.72s)]
*  to drill down a little bit. I think that was a great summary from a macro perspective, from a, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2341.68s)]
*  from a, you know, drilling down from an innovation perspective, I see three areas [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2347.12s)]
*  sort of come to my mind. We have to be more specific with these drugs. What do I mean by that? [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2352.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, tissue tropism, you know, you have a range of, you know, we look at range of diseases, [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2359.92s)]
*  you know, when I was in seropra, we were looking at Tushan's muscular dystrophy, a range of other [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2364.88s)]
*  dystrophies, muscular dystrophies. And people in different laboratories are looking at CNS disorders [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2369.6s)]
*  like Huntington and Parkinson's and things like that. In Aruvant, we are looking at sickle cell [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2375.84s)]
*  disease, hypophosphatacea, diseases like that. They are all different diseases and they target [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2381.76s)]
*  different tissues. And if we can have doses and virus particles that can specifically target these [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2387.28s)]
*  tissues, you eliminate the risk of bystander effect. You know, the virus particles are going [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2394.48s)]
*  to interact with other tissues in the body, thereby eliminating the safety risks that come [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2400.5600000000004s)]
*  with that. And we have seen insertional mutagenesis and pronal dominance in some of these studies. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2405.1200000000003s)]
*  And that's going to be the huge issue for this gene therapy field going forward. So number one, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2412.08s)]
*  be more specific and targeted to tissues. And if you can find virus particles that can do it, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2417.92s)]
*  that's fabulous. Number two, I would like to decrease the dose. You know, right now we are [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2424.16s)]
*  putting millions of cells or millions of virus particles as a dose and these need to be cleared [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2429.92s)]
*  in some fashion. You know, kidneys, livers work over time in these patients. We got to be able to [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2436.4s)]
*  do that and decrease the dose so that first you can keep it safe for the patients and efficacious [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2442.56s)]
*  and second, you can decrease the cost of those. So the amount of money people pay for these doses [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2449.52s)]
*  becomes, you know, lesser and lesser. What does that do? It sort of takes the drug and gives access [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2454.56s)]
*  worldwide because remember you can charge patients in one market one way, but you can't [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2460.88s)]
*  charge patients the same way in other markets. You got to be able to make the drug work for [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2466.8s)]
*  everybody in the world. So I think that's going to be the key themes in my mind. Custutropism [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2471.76s)]
*  and keep it specific and targeted, decrease the dose and decrease the cost of goods and keep, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2477.6s)]
*  you know, give access whoever needs that drug worldwide. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2484.4s)]
*  Yeah. Tony had mentioned just a few minutes ago that this is, you know, many of these processes [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2488.56s)]
*  to meet those ends that you just mentioned, Pallani, are still manual and that there's room [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2494.56s)]
*  for improvement around automation. So, and I almost hesitate to ask this question because [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2499.76s)]
*  I know that the gap between achieving the things you just mentioned, you know, specificity, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2506.64s)]
*  tissue specificity and decreasing dosage, a lot of that is manual learning exercise. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2511.36s)]
*  But is there an opportunity or are our companies right now leveraging [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2519.2000000000003s)]
*  advanced technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence to kind of address [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2525.04s)]
*  those things and help along the way to get closer to the answers? [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2532.08s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. I think that's where the industry is going. You know, if you look at [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2536.2400000000002s)]
*  the number of companies that's come about in the Cambridge area in the last two years, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2540.32s)]
*  a lot of them focus on machine learning. You know, companies that came out of MIT and [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2545.2000000000003s)]
*  other places focus on using machine learning, you know, algorithms to be able to identify those types [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2550.2400000000002s)]
*  of, you know, capsids, different types of capsids that can target select tissues and different types [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2559.28s)]
*  of capsids that can cross the blood-brain barrier, things like that. So there's a ton of effort going [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2567.36s)]
*  on. And, you know, are we going to have success overnight in this space? Perhaps not. But as we [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2573.44s)]
*  continue the effort, I'm very hopeful in the last, you know, few years, we saw the tremendous [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2579.92s)]
*  amount of progress we made. In the next few years, we're going to see tremendous, a tremendous amount [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2585.84s)]
*  of progress that will be made in the space of making it tissue tropic, making it low dose, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2590.88s)]
*  making it, you know, impure, you know, pure and things of that nature is going to take a lot of [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2598.0s)]
*  focus as we go forward. Remember, there is about, you know, if you look at the rare disease space, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2605.6s)]
*  there's probably 8,000 plus diseases out there. And we got to tackle all of them someday. You know, [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2612.08s)]
*  we are probably focused on 10% of that 8,000 plus diseases today. We got, we got the opportunity is [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2619.12s)]
*  unlimited here to be able to do machine learning, artificial intelligence to tackle some of those [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2627.8399999999997s)]
*  challenges. Yeah. Yeah, Pilani, you actually reminded me of, you know, struck a memory for me. So, [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2633.12s)]
*  Matt, I don't know if I ever shared this with either one of you. So probably three, four years [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2640.0s)]
*  ago, I was invited to the Gear Field CEO conference. Basically Gear Field has an [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2643.12s)]
*  annual event. Gear Field Management, you know, it's a private equity fund, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2647.8399999999997s)]
*  focused on healthiest space. I think they manage over, you know, 12 to 14 billion [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2651.6s)]
*  actively. But I was invited to attend that and there was the keynote speaker, his name was Dr. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2657.6s)]
*  Sidditha Maharaj, I believe was his name. And he's the, he's a prize winner and author of [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2663.68s)]
*  The Emperor of All the Ladies. Okay. And he gives this phenomenal presentation, like so enamored. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2670.16s)]
*  And what he hit on, which was his opening, you know, lines, if you will, where he showed his [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2677.2s)]
*  best friend at a wedding. This comes back to AI. So I promise I'm not going off the deep end. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2683.68s)]
*  I'm staying focused. So, you know me, Tony, I'll go down any rabbit hole you want to dig. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2689.04s)]
*  So either way, he shows his best friend at a wedding. He attended the wedding and [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2695.8399999999997s)]
*  he had, but you know, what the doctor diagnosed was just a mole on his face. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2700.2400000000002s)]
*  Six months later, cancer, one, two months later, passes away. And so, you know, Dr. Sidditha was [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2706.88s)]
*  like, I'm all about this focused in, how did we miss this? And they put it through AI. So they [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2713.44s)]
*  did this, you know, software and they trained the software to be able to identify cancer. And basically, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2720.56s)]
*  they were able to run this photo through with millions of other photos and identify his cancer. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2725.6s)]
*  And if they would have caught it then, something that wasn't known to the human eye, [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2730.56s)]
*  they would have been able to treat it. And that, you know, individual would still be with them today. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2735.04s)]
*  And that struck a chord with me and drilled into my mind how exciting and important AI will be [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2739.04s)]
*  from a manufacturing, but also from a diagnostics perspective to see who really needs help [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2745.68s)]
*  and when to catch that early. Sure. Yeah. And I, you know, I think to the point I was making earlier [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2750.64s)]
*  around Palani's observances of, you know, things that a Ruvant is working on and that need to [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2756.8799999999997s)]
*  happen around dosage decreases and improving the efficacy of lower dosage, better tissue specificity. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2764.48s)]
*  It occurs to me that there are great applications for artificial intelligence there, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2774.0s)]
*  dependent on the data inputs, right? I mean, the data, to your point, Tony, there's got to be a whole [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2779.04s)]
*  big database to work with to be able to identify, you know, potential risk in facial recognition or [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2784.8s)]
*  mole recognition. So, you know, it's all data input dependent. Right. You have to train that [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2791.76s)]
*  artificial intelligence, right? So it can identify. It's no different than, you know, yeah, we do [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2797.44s)]
*  manufacturing strategy and execution. Every time we execute, we re-input the data to have better [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2801.76s)]
*  strategy. You know, it's just constant, you know, engineering P and ID loop, right? But constant [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2806.32s)]
*  loop of enhancement. Same thing with AI, right? We got to pull all this data of non-cancerous to [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2811.76s)]
*  cancerous, you know, images and see, you know, the system can be trained and captured early. So [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2817.92s)]
*  the data's got to be there. Exactly. The disease that we are dealing with these days are so [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2824.96s)]
*  heterogeneous, right? And, you know, I think there may be one or two or three or five patients [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2830.24s)]
*  worldwide on some of these diseases and your ability to detect them and treat them appropriately in a [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2836.7999999999997s)]
*  personalized manner is going to be a key one. I'm not saying that's going to be the standard paradigm, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2842.56s)]
*  but there's going to be situations like this in some of these rare diseases that we'll have to deal [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2848.0s)]
*  with. So artificial intelligence is going to play a major role in this setting going forward. That's [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2852.3199999999997s)]
*  just my hope and expectation as well. Yeah. So we're running a bit short on time here, but I want [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2858.48s)]
*  to crank out a couple more responses from you two if you'll indulge me as we wrap things up. Tony, [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2865.12s)]
*  I want to get your perspective on the movement towards non-viral delivery methods. I know that's [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2872.48s)]
*  been a hot topic lately. How do you see them non-viral? How do you see that playing a role [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2878.4s)]
*  as we move forward? Yeah, I mean, it's an exciting situation that we're in. And look, I mean, I think, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2886.88s)]
*  you know, the viral vector solutions are here to stay, you know, especially for the, you know, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2894.1600000000003s)]
*  short to midterm, you know, we have a proven solution and we can penetrate different parts [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2898.4s)]
*  of the human body that we couldn't previously to carry, you know, different genes and get them [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2903.44s)]
*  access to the, you know, you know, pass one main barrier into a systemic solution and whatnot. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2907.2000000000003s)]
*  But, you know, the non-viral, you know, solutions, I think that they will continue to improve. I [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2913.2s)]
*  think they're going to play a critical role in upcoming years. The biggest thing for me that's [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2918.0s)]
*  interesting and kind of zooming out is right now when we have a viral vector solution, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2923.52s)]
*  there's also, you know, there's companion diagnostics to verify if people are, you know, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2930.16s)]
*  the right fit for the, you know, the treatment of the drug. There's also post-treatment where [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2934.16s)]
*  you build up an immunity, right? And I think with non-viral, you know, solutions out there, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2939.2799999999997s)]
*  delivery methods, there's an opportunity to maybe have one or, you know, we only think about one [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2944.7999999999997s)]
*  treatment nowadays, but what if you needed multiple treatments to save a life and there [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2948.72s)]
*  are different diseases? If your body has built up immunity to it, you may not be a candidate to [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2952.72s)]
*  receive another dose of something else that could help. So that's what's very exciting about the [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2957.9199999999996s)]
*  non-viral side. I mean, the non-viral side compared to viral vector, you know, right now there's a [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2962.7999999999997s)]
*  little cytotoxicity, immunogenicity, you know, attracting more researchers to explore like how we [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2967.2s)]
*  can promise delivery systems and move the gene therapy forward. The non-viral also does not [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2973.68s)]
*  carry ideal characteristics and, you know, has faced critical challenges such as the gene transfer [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2979.7599999999998s)]
*  efficiencies, right? And the specificity around that and the safety. So I think that it's got some [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2985.04s)]
*  areas to improve, but non-viral vectors have a fast, you know, pace research topic in gene delivery [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2992.72s)]
*  and I think that they'll continue to improve the viral vector right now. We found that we've got a [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=2998.72s)]
*  proven solution. We've got great data. It's gone through the regulatory pathway, put into humans and [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3003.2s)]
*  it's continuing to show good success and I think that'll be great, but there's also, you know, [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3009.2s)]
*  drawbacks to that, right? So, you know, understanding the long-term, in fact, we've [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3013.92s)]
*  gone and used viral vectors previously, right? We've had catastrophic experiences with it and, [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3018.64s)]
*  you know, that's where we have our adeno-associated virus now instead of just the adeno virus and, [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3024.08s)]
*  you know, I think that there's going to continue to be more enhancements on both [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3030.08s)]
*  forefronts and they'll both play a good role. Pahani, any thoughts from your end? [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3033.36s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. You know, we've talked about it quite a bit in terms of, you know, my background [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3038.0s)]
*  with non-viral delivery goes back to my earlier days very early on. I worked for a small company [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3043.28s)]
*  Nextar Pharmaceuticals, which was eventually acquired by Gilead and at the time we were [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3048.4799999999996s)]
*  thinking the lipid bubbles that we call, you know, LNP these days was used to contain drugs like [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3053.7599999999998s)]
*  amphetamines and donorobins and doxorobins to make them safer because these drugs themselves, [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3062.7999999999997s)]
*  by themselves, are very toxic drugs. So, we wanted to shield them in a bubble so you can get them to [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3069.7599999999998s)]
*  the right tissues and so on and so forth. The industry has come a long way and we've called [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3075.6s)]
*  them AB0 or LBV0 in some ways. That sort of says what we mean by that, right? And the key goal here [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3082.24s)]
*  is to get the transgene to the right tissue and there are, you know, particles that do that these [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3089.7599999999998s)]
*  days and we saw a great data from Italia and Regeneron over the last weekend of injecting [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3096.16s)]
*  these particles in vivo and creating the Cas9 needed to do the gene editing in vivo. I think [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3102.16s)]
*  things like that are happening but still I think, as Tony noted, the virus particles are the natural [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3110.16s)]
*  way to get this to the tissues and viruses know how to get to the tissues. We all know that, right? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3116.72s)]
*  And I think this is here to stay but we will make tremendous progress given the success that we have [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3122.64s)]
*  had with the lipid particles over the years and I have tremendous expectation from that field as [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3128.24s)]
*  well, you know, going forward to make it more specific, more targeted, more tissue-tropic [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3136.3999999999996s)]
*  and so on. So, same challenges, right? It doesn't matter, virus particles doesn't matter non-viral. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3143.6s)]
*  The challenges are same. The key question is going to be, you know, what sort of progress can we make [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3150.0s)]
*  to meet those challenges that are broad? Yeah, yeah, big challenges but big opportunities. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3155.52s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. You know, Bonnie, that Italia story really exciting. I was speaking with some [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3161.92s)]
*  of our colleagues at Blackstone Life Sciences about it and, I mean, talk about a massive movement [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3166.4s)]
*  around CRISPR and gene editing in the space and how just promising and exciting that can look and [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3173.2s)]
*  with the great data that's coming out and modifying in human type, you know, genes and things like that, [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3179.28s)]
*  that could really change the, you know, landscape of how we treat people and manufacture, if you will. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3184.8s)]
*  So, it's super exciting, super promising for sure. Yeah, I'm a question about it. I think so. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3192.1600000000003s)]
*  So, to wrap things up, like I said, we unfortunately, we have to. I feel like we [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3199.84s)]
*  could talk for another hour. We might have to do a part two if it's okay with you guys. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3203.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3207.9199999999996s)]
*  I want to wrap things up by inviting you, Palani, to share with me. Hey, you've covered a lot of [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3209.52s)]
*  ground today but what, if you had to sort of crystallize, what you're most excited about [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3215.3599999999997s)]
*  and maybe what you're most concerned about moving forward, what would those be? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3221.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so I think just to address your first, second question first, I think the [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3226.3999999999996s)]
*  the thing I'm excited about is the opportunity to be able to treat any disease, right, using [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3232.64s)]
*  gene therapy paradigm or cell therapy paradigm or in vivo gene therapy cell therapy paradigm. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3239.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a great opportunity for all of us. I think the diseases are here to stay and they're going [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3244.7999999999997s)]
*  to increase in number and we got to come up with a base to deal with that. That said, you know, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3252.7999999999997s)]
*  one thing that I worry about all the time is we seem to be in this idea that we are just one event [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3258.16s)]
*  away from everything breaking and breaking down, falling apart. I think we need to get past that [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3264.7999999999997s)]
*  idea. That's what keeps me at night. And on top of that, we talked about a couple of other things [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3272.24s)]
*  in the space. One, I worry about access. When we develop a drug, this is going to be accessible [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3278.16s)]
*  worldwide, particularly for me, knowing sickle cell disease and the epidemiology there. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3285.92s)]
*  It's an African disease, it's a Southeast Asian disease, it's Mediterranean disease. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3293.04s)]
*  Can we get this drug to worldwide? That's another thing that keeps me at night, [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3299.6800000000003s)]
*  so which has a lot of components in it, cost of goods and those and all of that. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3305.92s)]
*  And last but not least, I worry about the talent pool. Tony touched on this earlier. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3311.44s)]
*  We can train people, but we need workforce that's well versed. In the 90s and 80s, I don't know if [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3317.68s)]
*  you remember this, we built biologics programs, interdisciplinary programs in many of these [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3323.68s)]
*  universities and institutions that broaden workforce, knowing what to do with biologics [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3329.92s)]
*  development. I think we have to take that approach now. The talent pool is small, [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3336.4s)]
*  and everyone is going after that same talent pool. And that is a differentiating factor in [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3341.44s)]
*  anything we do. Technologies can come and go, but the talent pool, the people are going to be here [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3347.04s)]
*  to stay. And that's a differentiating factor for many of us. I feel like that's going to, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3353.28s)]
*  we are sort of getting thinner every day. Yeah. You know, Pawnee, like I always, [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3359.12s)]
*  in our organization at PF, I'm always imploring, tell me, and I forget, teach me, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3365.44s)]
*  and I may remember, involve me, and I learn. And you've heard me say it many times, just having [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3372.56s)]
*  engineers and team members and project leads involved in different strategy discussions that [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3379.04s)]
*  usually they wouldn't be involved in, and just having to be courtside seats, if you will, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3385.84s)]
*  to that to just mitigate the talent bottleneck. And the same thing needs to apply across the [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3390.08s)]
*  industry. We need to involve our talent so that they can learn, and there's many ways to involve [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3393.92s)]
*  them. Yeah. And then just, my most exciting thing, I think you've heard me share this with both of [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3398.48s)]
*  you is, again, it's a privilege to be a part of this industry. If you haven't seen it yet, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3404.32s)]
*  go watch The Ataxian. It's a great movie. It's about Friedrich Ataxia, raises awareness, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3409.36s)]
*  one of the many muscular dystrophies that we're all trying to cure. But just being a part of a [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3415.04s)]
*  you know, a therapeutic revolution where we can all work together as a team, lock arms, and cure [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3420.08s)]
*  incurable diseases, and save and create lives, there's nothing more rewarding than that. And [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3426.32s)]
*  it doesn't matter, you know, however we get there, and however we do it, it's a privilege, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvJT21wiKCM&t=3433.6s)]
