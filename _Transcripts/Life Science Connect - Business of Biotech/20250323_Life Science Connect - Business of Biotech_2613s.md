Video Description: In this final installment of our episodes recorded and filmed on-site at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, Nima Farzan, CEO of Latigo Biotherapeutics, shares his company's mission to change the pain management paradigm by way of novel, non-opioid medications that target NAV 1.8 sodium channels involved in pain signal transmission. It's a timely and important conversation that explores how these selective inhibitors could provide effective pain relief without the addiction risks and side effects of traditional opioids. In addition to the social and medical implications of Latigo's work, we discuss investor perceptions about pain management as a commercial opportunity and how Latigo is differentiating from traditional approaches by focusing on safety and tolerability rather than just efficacy.

# BoB@JPM: Nima Farzan, Latigo Biotherapeutics
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [March 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM)
*  Cane management has been overdue for an overhaul for far too long. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=0.0s)]
*  NEMA Farzan is keen to change that paradigm. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=8.56s)]
*  I'm Ben Comer. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=11.92s)]
*  And I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=12.92s)]
*  And this is the Business of Biotech JP Morgan 2025 edition. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=14.16s)]
*  We are here in San Francisco at the beautiful law offices of Alston and Byrd with NEMA, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=18.88s)]
*  CEO at Latico Biotherapeutics and one of the most enthusiastic CEOs I might add that we've known [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=25.44s)]
*  to discuss his small biotech's intent on taking big primary care problem in a biotech space that's [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=32.72s)]
*  often focused on very small and expensive problems. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=41.6s)]
*  Thank you, NEMA, for joining us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=46.64s)]
*  My pleasure. I'm excited to be here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=48.16s)]
*  We're excited to have you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=49.44s)]
*  You've spent five and a half years now leading groups and marketing at Novartis before jumping [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=51.52s)]
*  into biotech and venture capital. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  So whenever we often have biotech execs on the show who come from big pharma and jump [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  into a biotech endeavor. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=65.84s)]
*  And I'm always curious about the motivation to do so. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=68.16s)]
*  So what was yours? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I grew up in the Bay Area. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=72.64s)]
*  And so I grew up at a time when, you know, who we looked up to were the innovators in [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=74.88s)]
*  Silicon Valley and tech. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=80.88s)]
*  Both of my parents were in tech. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=82.24s)]
*  And so I always wanted to be actually on the more innovative small company side. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  I actually did it before business school. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=88.96s)]
*  I was at a genomics company and that sort of early.com boom time frame. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Decided to go to business school and then realized like, you know, for me to be truly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=95.44s)]
*  successful in this industry, I need to learn it's a really complicated thing. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=98.8s)]
*  You've got to learn it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=102.8s)]
*  And what better place to learn it than one of the big pharma companies that they know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=104.4s)]
*  how to do these things. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=107.36s)]
*  So I went to Novartis with the intention to learn the business, learn drug development. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=108.48s)]
*  Actually ended up loving it and saying longer than I thought. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=113.36s)]
*  I thought it'd be a check the box couple years down back. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=115.6s)]
*  And it was actually about seven years before I was like, you know, I want to get back to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=118.88s)]
*  what I've always wanted to do, which is something more entrepreneurial, something more innovative. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  And I came out of Novartis with, you know, I think the beginnings of understanding how [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=127.36s)]
*  to do drug development. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=132.8s)]
*  It's a lifelong process, but I got the basics so that I could go into biotech and apply [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=133.92s)]
*  that. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=138.96s)]
*  How did your time at Foresight Capital prepare you for the rigors of biotech building? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=141.76s)]
*  Yeah, I spent a couple stints as an executive residence at Foresight in between different [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=149.6s)]
*  CEO roles. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=154.64s)]
*  And what I will tell you is that it confirmed to me that I'm not a venture capitalist. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=155.68s)]
*  I like to build companies, right? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=161.6s)]
*  So it's funny when you're sitting there and you're seeing companies several a day come [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=163.12s)]
*  and pitch. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=167.76000000000002s)]
*  And invariably, your reaction is like, that's really cool. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=168.24s)]
*  I'd love to like get in deep on that and help build that, figure that out and drive that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=171.68s)]
*  But as a venture capitalist, you know, on to the next and on to the next. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=175.60000000000002s)]
*  So it was great, you know, pull up and kind of see the broader picture of what's going [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=179.28s)]
*  on in the industry, see trends. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=182.96s)]
*  But also just reconfirms that like what I want to do is build companies and develop [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=184.56s)]
*  drugs. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=189.76s)]
*  And so, you know, it's a great relationship with Foresight. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=191.44s)]
*  I've worked with them a couple times now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=195.44s)]
*  They show me exciting things in their portfolio. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=197.12s)]
*  When I get excited, I jump in. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=199.04s)]
*  It probably helped you improve your pitches too, I would imagine. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=201.84s)]
*  Oh, for sure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=204.56s)]
*  To see how it's interpreted on the back end and how it's discussed on the back end. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=205.2s)]
*  What resonates, what doesn't. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=209.76s)]
*  That was very helpful. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=212.08s)]
*  If any of your stints at Foresight overlapped with Vic Bajaj's time there. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=213.36s)]
*  Yes, he was on the podcast pre-JPM and not too long ago, just a few weeks before he came [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=217.76000000000002s)]
*  to JPM. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=222.48000000000002s)]
*  Yes, he was a guest on the podcast. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=222.96s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=224.56s)]
*  He's a great guy, incredibly smart. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=225.12s)]
*  Incredibly smart, intimidatingly smart. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=229.68s)]
*  So we had the luxury of a conversation with you a couple of weeks ago. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=231.36s)]
*  And one of the things that you said that is, you know, not just clairvoyant, but it's proving [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  true in the conversations that I'm having with plenty of founders, biotech founders [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=241.04s)]
*  and builders here at the show. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=247.04s)]
*  In all sorts of modalities, you said that you believe that we as an industry are on [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  the cusp of a renewal of drugs for the masses. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=255.84s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=259.76s)]
*  Which, you know, I mean, in the last several years, Ben, we've been covering this space [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  and there's been a ton, especially in the ATMP arena, there's been a ton of interest [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=263.92s)]
*  in, you know, ultra rare and rare disease. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=268.16s)]
*  But even in those ATMP spaces, like at this show, I've had so many conversations with [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=271.6s)]
*  folks who are doing genetic therapies, for instance, who want to pursue big, big giant [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=276.16s)]
*  indications, which is awesome. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=280.56s)]
*  The indication you're working in has a super big opportunity. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=282.16s)]
*  But getting back to the point about, you know, this being on the cusp of an era of drug for [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=287.84000000000003s)]
*  the masses, what are the indicators for you? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=293.20000000000005s)]
*  Like, what's indicating that for you? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=295.6s)]
*  Why do you say that? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=297.36s)]
*  Why do I say that? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=298.24s)]
*  Well, I think a couple of things. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  So, I mean, things are cyclical, right? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=299.92s)]
*  And for a long time, rare diseases were ignored because people didn't think there was a business [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=301.76s)]
*  model until a lot of it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  And then that became an opportunity. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=306.88s)]
*  People started investing their successes and there was more and more in rare disease. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=308.08000000000004s)]
*  And at some point, the pendulum has to swing back, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=312.48s)]
*  We now ignored R&D investment and some of the larger opportunities. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=314.72s)]
*  And, you know, frankly, the obesity space and some of the, you know, gently ones that [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=319.12s)]
*  really help drive the fact back that you can actually have very impactful drugs that can [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=324.24s)]
*  be meaningful for people's health across very broad populations, that there still is a lot of [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=329.52000000000004s)]
*  that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=333.12s)]
*  And a commercial opportunity if you can develop those compounds. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=334.08000000000004s)]
*  So I think that's been part of it is just the pendulum and cycling back. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=336.96000000000004s)]
*  And some of it has been the specific successes in obesity that have opened people's eyes to [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  there really is still a lot of what met me in some of these primary care segments. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=346.96000000000004s)]
*  Are there any incentives changing? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=352.0s)]
*  Because, you know, obviously part of the reason that there has been this enormous focus on rare [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=354.32s)]
*  disease, aside from the unmet need, which we're acknowledging is faster time to market, smaller [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=359.52s)]
*  trials, sometimes better IP protection for the larger indication, more expensive trials, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=365.12s)]
*  primary care drugs. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=372.96s)]
*  You know, are there any kind of the dynamics that are shifting to help, you know, to help [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=375.44s)]
*  the, you know, I wish that were more true on the R&D side. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=380.72s)]
*  I think in pain, there are some specific things that are helpful. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  But in general, I don't necessarily think of something. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  But what I will say is that some of the commercial incentives are changing. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=392.08000000000004s)]
*  So if you think about what, you know, I, as we talked about when I was a new artist, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  I was working in primary care, we had thousands of reps selling hypertensive drugs. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=400.88000000000005s)]
*  And now we've gotten, you know, frankly, away from those rep wars and parallel lines and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=406.4s)]
*  gotten better at using technology and different ways to access physicians so that you can [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=414.08s)]
*  actually commercialize primary care drugs with, you know, a more reasonable rational [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=417.84s)]
*  footprint. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=422.15999999999997s)]
*  So that helps in terms of the MPV analysis, if you will. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=422.64s)]
*  On drug development side, you know, there's a lot of exciting technologies. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  Obviously talk about AI and, you know, regulatory innovation is important. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=431.92s)]
*  But those are so fairly nascent. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=436.64s)]
*  I mean, it's still, you're still having to do the safety studies and the larger scale [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  studies that you need to do to access a primary care market. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=443.92s)]
*  One strategy that companies have used for years is to go after a really rare disease first, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=449.12s)]
*  and get on the market. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=454.8s)]
*  And then of course, you know, expand the indication later go for a larger population. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=455.76s)]
*  Is that something that could happen in pain? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=460.96s)]
*  Have you seen that kind of strategy? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=464.4s)]
*  Sure. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=467.76s)]
*  In one very clear way, it's exactly how it's playing out. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=469.44s)]
*  So it's not quite a super niche indication of pain, but acute pain versus chronic. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=471.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=476.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=477.12s)]
*  So acute pain, let's talk about as primarily post-surgical. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=477.35999999999996s)]
*  I've had a procedure, there's my wisdom teeth taken out or knee repair or something larger. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  Or it's some sort of severe non-surgical pain. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=485.35999999999996s)]
*  I've sprained an ankle badly. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=488.24s)]
*  I've thrown on my back or something like that. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=490.16s)]
*  It doesn't, it's not a niche indication, but it is a much smaller indication than chronic pain. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=492.08s)]
*  Osteoarthritis, diabetic neuropathy, you know, headache, muscle, lower back pain, etc. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=496.96000000000004s)]
*  But the big advantage of acute pain relative to chronic pain and the reason why it's a faster [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=504.24s)]
*  to market, it's a more tenable development plan for small companies as well as large companies, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=509.2s)]
*  is the duration of treatment. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=515.04s)]
*  It's limited, you know, typically when the FDA talks about acute pain, it's under 30 days. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=517.5999999999999s)]
*  And often actually you're getting prescriptions in maybe the last two weeks. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  And so when you're treating someone for that duration of time, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=528.0s)]
*  there are a couple of things that make the development that much easier, right? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=531.28s)]
*  So one, clearly you don't have to have long studies. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=533.8399999999999s)]
*  You can determine your end point in a couple of days. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=536.24s)]
*  You know, that's nice. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=539.28s)]
*  And in fact, our first end point that you're going to look at is 15 minutes. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  We want to see onset of pain relief starting, you know, ideally, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=544.16s)]
*  maybe not at 15 minutes, but soon thereafter. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=547.68s)]
*  So you start looking at 15 minutes. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=549.68s)]
*  So you're getting an immediate lead out. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=551.28s)]
*  And because the duration of treatment isn't that long, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=554.48s)]
*  the safety database you have to build for regulatory approval is less, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=558.24s)]
*  You don't have to have your long studies with patients because, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=562.8s)]
*  you know, treating them for that kind of duration. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=566.48s)]
*  So acute pain is where you would start as an option. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  If you have a broad acting analgesic, like we believe we do, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=572.96s)]
*  acute pain is where you start because of that pathway is faster there. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=577.36s)]
*  And it is a more limited market because these prescriptions are two weeks. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=580.32s)]
*  They're not lifelong prescriptions because I have chronic pain. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=586.32s)]
*  So why pain? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=587.76s)]
*  That's a fundamental question we just kind of glossed right over. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=590.08s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=592.72s)]
*  Why this company and why pain? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=594.72s)]
*  I mean, do you know anyone who hasn't had pain? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=597.84s)]
*  I'm in pain as we speak. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=601.76s)]
*  Right. Exactly. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  It touches all of us, right? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=605.5999999999999s)]
*  Not because of this conversation. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=608.3199999999999s)]
*  No, no, it was here before we got the guy. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=610.8s)]
*  That's good to know. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=613.92s)]
*  I mean, pain touches all of us and all pain at some point of our lives, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=616.3199999999999s)]
*  or will be a pain at some point of our lives. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=619.52s)]
*  And we look at patients who are dealing with chronic pain in particular. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=622.0s)]
*  It is debilitating. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=625.12s)]
*  It's very hard to focus, to function, and to operate in life. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=626.88s)]
*  So I look back on my career and I've worked, the biotechs that I've run [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=632.64s)]
*  since my time in the bar, one was in infectious disease and vaccines, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  one was in precision oncology. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=640.88s)]
*  And what I liked about vaccines was this ability to impact a lot of people. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=642.8s)]
*  Vaccines are something that many people can take. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=648.3199999999999s)]
*  But the tangible benefit of that vaccine is not obvious to the patient. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=651.28s)]
*  It either works, they never get the disease, they never think about it again. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=654.96s)]
*  You don't get that direct impact. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=660.4000000000001s)]
*  It's a theoretical impact you've made and you kind of have to calculate it [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  on many thousands of people taking your vaccine. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=664.4000000000001s)]
*  So when I transitioned to the oncology side, we're talking about patients [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=667.44s)]
*  with stage four terminal cancer that have run out of all other options. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=671.12s)]
*  Many of them have diagnosed weak slat. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=674.96s)]
*  And if you're a drug, can reverse that tumor growth, have aggression, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=678.0s)]
*  and you can add months or years to that patient's life, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=683.84s)]
*  I mean, that's an amazing, amazing impact that you can have immediately [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  on somebody who might have no other options. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=689.52s)]
*  But the fundamentals of that business are very rare types of cancer [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=691.52s)]
*  you're doing, that we were doing, and the whole concept of precision is [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=695.84s)]
*  very genetically specific patient populations that might occur in 1% of the tumor type. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=698.96s)]
*  And if that patient had that mutation, you may have a drug for that. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=704.48s)]
*  So it's really small numbers of patients you're impacting. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=707.76s)]
*  Pain gave me the opportunity to do both. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=710.8000000000001s)]
*  To have something that impacts everyone, but it also has a meaningful, tangible [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  benefit to their lives immediately. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=720.8000000000001s)]
*  And I say that, but we talked about within 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or one hour, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=723.28s)]
*  that you can help alleviate pain. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=727.2s)]
*  And it doesn't take living in San Francisco to know that the opioid crisis [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=730.4s)]
*  has been a huge societal challenge. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=736.72s)]
*  And the problem in pain is not a lack of efficacy for the drugs we have. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=739.9200000000001s)]
*  We can completely eliminate your pain if you're willing to take enough morphine. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=745.84s)]
*  That's not the problem. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=749.76s)]
*  The problem is can you develop drugs that have that pain relief that are safe and tall? [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=750.8000000000001s)]
*  And what Labigov's working on has that opportunity and really can create, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=755.5200000000001s)]
*  not just have a health impact like we've been talking about, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=763.0400000000001s)]
*  but positive socioeconomic, socio-political impact by helping eliminate, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=765.68s)]
*  most likely reduce, the use of opioids. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=770.4799999999999s)]
*  How is that proposition being received by an investment community that has been enamored [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=775.4399999999999s)]
*  of late with ATMPs and super sexy fancy stuff? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=782.64s)]
*  Not that yours isn't, but it's definitely a world away from [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=788.3199999999999s)]
*  gene therapies. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=794.24s)]
*  It is. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=795.12s)]
*  And for some, I will say we've had success and there's definitely been investors who are [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=795.8399999999999s)]
*  very strong, little, recent supporters of this. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=802.16s)]
*  And you understand intuitively and immediately the patient need here and the rationale. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=804.0s)]
*  But there are definitely investors who are used to saying, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=812.64s)]
*  well, they're generic drugs, I mean generic opioids, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=815.1999999999999s)]
*  and don't you have to have efficacy substantially better than the generic to get used? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=818.9599999999999s)]
*  If they'll go because people don't want to take an opioid. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=822.88s)]
*  Patients don't want to take opioids. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=825.84s)]
*  Physicians don't want to prescribe opioids. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  There's a lot of bureaucracy associated with tracking how many opioid prescriptions you have [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=829.2800000000001s)]
*  relative to the number of patients you're seeing and reporting that you have to do state by state [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=833.12s)]
*  level. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=837.12s)]
*  Governments don't want prescribers prescribing opioids. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=837.9200000000001s)]
*  They want to limit it, creating incentives to move away from it and restrictions from going to it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=841.2s)]
*  So it is a little bit of a different mindset. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=846.48s)]
*  This thing I talked about, which is the efficacy in pain is not the unmet need. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=849.6s)]
*  It's the safety and tolerability. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=855.12s)]
*  It's not how investors are used to thinking. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=856.24s)]
*  They're used to thinking about how are you more efficacious than the generic so that [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=858.0s)]
*  you'll get reimbursed? [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=862.32s)]
*  And this is a different societal issue. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=863.6800000000001s)]
*  I'd say most get it, but definitely some need some discussions around that. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=865.36s)]
*  Does that societal impact, that more global, broad societal impact open up for you? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=872.08s)]
*  Perhaps a new pocket or a different pocket of potential investment than traditional [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=879.2s)]
*  biotech pharma investors? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=884.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=885.9200000000001s)]
*  I mean, it has. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=886.88s)]
*  Here's what I would say. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=888.32s)]
*  We have stuck to the more traditional investors. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=889.12s)]
*  Now, there are certainly non-traditional investors that we can go to, but within the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=891.6800000000001s)]
*  traditional investors are something a little more machine driven. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=895.2800000000001s)]
*  And we have found that those do correlate in that respect. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=897.9200000000001s)]
*  I do think that there are some of our investors that look at that and say there are benefits here [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=901.36s)]
*  that we want to be a part of. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=906.4000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=907.9200000000001s)]
*  Pain is famously hard to measure objectively. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=909.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=913.44s)]
*  If you're in pain, you know. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=914.6400000000001s)]
*  That's right. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=915.6800000000001s)]
*  And often how much pain you're in is which face you point to. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=916.6400000000001s)]
*  On the pain chart, do you feel that there's a need for, or maybe there are already some [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=923.12s)]
*  new kinds of scales or other types of objective measures to assess different types of pain? [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  Have you worked on that at all? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=935.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=937.68s)]
*  So there are a couple of things, a couple of ways I'd answer that. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=938.0s)]
*  There are studies that you can run that are going to be a little more objective or functional. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=940.0799999999999s)]
*  So I'll mention studies that are called cold pressure studies. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=946.64s)]
*  And so what this type of study is, is you ask, in this case, it would be Alpi volunteer, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=951.12s)]
*  put their hand in a bucket of ice water that's one degree Celsius, see how long they can keep [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=956.9599999999999s)]
*  it in there, measure that as a baseline score. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=961.76s)]
*  Give them a randomized either placebo or your drug and ask them to do it again and see how [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=965.0400000000001s)]
*  much longer they can keep their hand in that water. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=969.2s)]
*  Now it's the same level of pain stimulus bucket of water at one degree, same person. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=971.9200000000001s)]
*  How much difference does the drug versus placebo make on their ability to tolerate that? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=976.4000000000001s)]
*  And you can measure that in seconds or percentage increase. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=980.88s)]
*  That's more quantitative than the scale, right? [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=983.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=986.4000000000001s)]
*  That's really a valuable tool for us. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=987.2s)]
*  It's not a pivotal study. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=989.0400000000001s)]
*  The FDA is not going to let you get your label based on that. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  You're still going to have to go into post-surgical pain or others. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=994.24s)]
*  But it's a very valuable way to objectively test your drugs early on. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=997.6s)]
*  And those are studies that we've done. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1001.28s)]
*  The other thing I would say, which is less about endpoints, but protocol design to manage [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1003.6s)]
*  this issue. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1011.52s)]
*  And there are things you can do. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1013.12s)]
*  And you would do this more in chronic pain studies that you would in acute. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1015.44s)]
*  But you can decide which patients you want to enroll in your study based on you did do [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1018.48s)]
*  a rolling screening period with patient diaries that they report their pain [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1023.84s)]
*  prior to entering your study. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1030.24s)]
*  And you look for patients that are good pain responders, meaning they actually do understand [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1032.08s)]
*  it's not everyone can maybe conceptualize that pain and report it out. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1037.36s)]
*  So do I consistently report scores? [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1040.96s)]
*  Is there some variability? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1043.28s)]
*  Because if I say my pain is a five, five, five, five every day, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1044.72s)]
*  that's probably not a good pain reporter. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1047.4399999999998s)]
*  If I say one, 10, one, 10, I'm probably not a good pain reporter. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1050.24s)]
*  So you want a little bit of variability, not too much. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1053.36s)]
*  And we consider those patients good pain responders. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1055.52s)]
*  And those are ones that maybe will give you a little bit better in certain your sets. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1058.24s)]
*  And you are doing those kinds of studies as well. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1064.4799999999998s)]
*  While you're on the studies subject, give us an update on where the studies are at. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1066.8s)]
*  Yeah, we have a couple of compounds that are in the clinic right now. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1072.32s)]
*  Our first program is in phase two for acute pain. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1075.6000000000001s)]
*  So this is the one we talked about where post-surgical pain. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1079.92s)]
*  We're currently running that study and we're doing that in a [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1083.68s)]
*  wisdom teeth extraction post-surgical pain patient population. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1087.5200000000002s)]
*  Our second drug that we intend to develop for chronic pain is currently in phase one. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1091.7600000000002s)]
*  My dentist drawing, I've got a sign on the office door that said modern dentistry is painless. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1096.4s)]
*  So I'm not sure, you know, I mean, there's no issues. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1101.3600000000001s)]
*  When I had the wisdom teeth thing and I would have proved that theory wrong, of course. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1104.32s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1107.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1108.48s)]
*  So what are the next steps then? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1110.32s)]
*  So the next steps after that on the acute side, you move into pivotal studies. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1112.48s)]
*  And pivotal studies from a regulatory pathway, the agency would like to see [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1118.1599999999999s)]
*  one post-surgical study in patients who have had soft tissue surgery, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1123.36s)]
*  and one efficacy study in patients who have had hard tissue surgery or bony tissue. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1127.84s)]
*  So typically where we've evolved to, you know, different models of it used over time, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1133.12s)]
*  but today most people will do abdominal plasticity and bony nectomy as the soft tissue and hard tissue [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  studies. So you go into patients having those surgeries and need to run the studies in that. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1141.6799999999998s)]
*  And that is the efficacy studies you need to run for an acute indication. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1146.32s)]
*  Chronic, you have a lot more options. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1151.28s)]
*  There's a lot of different types of chronic pain. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1152.8799999999999s)]
*  And, you know, roughly I bucket it as neuropathic pain or musculoskeletal pain. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1155.52s)]
*  And our focus is going to be in the musculoskeletal side, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1160.5600000000002s)]
*  in particular where we started with osteoarthritis. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1163.68s)]
*  I think everyone recognizes the unmet need for new pain medications, non-obioids, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1167.52s)]
*  even regulators, I think would recognize that. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1174.3200000000002s)]
*  Or do you anticipate any sort of accelerated regulatory pathway, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1176.96s)]
*  breakthrough designation, anything like that? [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1182.4s)]
*  You know, I would hope that and believe that the agency will work with us in a number of parameters, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  given the unmet need. I think it's too soon to speculate on whether we would have breakthrough [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1192.48s)]
*  designation specifically. But, you know, I will say that to date in our interactions with the FDA, [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1196.96s)]
*  they've been very forthcoming in providing good guidance for us. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  I do think the FDA wants to see me him not an impure gang drones developed. And so they've [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1209.04s)]
*  been very forthcoming. Our friends at Alston and Byrd set us up with some amazing space to record [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1214.08s)]
*  during JPM week. The firm's National Healthcare and Life Sciences practice has more than 100 [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1221.9199999999998s)]
*  attorneys actively involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1227.76s)]
*  disciplines. The signature strength of this practice is its ability to master complex [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1233.4399999999998s)]
*  representations that draw on the coordinated expertise of its regulatory, compliance, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1238.72s)]
*  public policy, transactional, corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1244.88s)]
*  government investigations, and litigation practice areas. Alston and Byrd represents [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1253.3600000000001s)]
*  life sciences companies and their partners in corporate stages ranging from private to [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  newly public to well established and in a variety of stages of product development from [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1264.16s)]
*  preclinical to post approval commercial launch. Learn more at Alston.com and tell them you learned [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1269.6000000000001s)]
*  about them on the Business of Biotech. Give us a sense for Latigo's, I guess, growth and, [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1276.5600000000002s)]
*  and I use the term like, like shape shifting as a biotech moves from R&D into a clinical stage, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1288.32s)]
*  into a potentially manufacturing environment. Where are you now on that? And sort of what have [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1298.8s)]
*  you had to grow through in your time there? No, I mean, this is what I love talking about, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1307.12s)]
*  is this is what I've done the last few times. And this is where I think I can bring expertise [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  to bears. How do you transition from a discovery company to a discovery and development company, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1317.6s)]
*  and even to a late stage development company, early stage commercial company? I think that's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1322.56s)]
*  kind of my sweet spot in, you know, we've been in my career. I'm glad I asked. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1326.9599999999998s)]
*  So I think, you know, when I came in about six months ago, the company had primarily a [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1334.24s)]
*  discovery team in place. There's Sean's discovery team that developed multiple compounds and now [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1340.7199999999998s)]
*  taking into the clinic over literally the very initial stages of building development capabilities. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1345.44s)]
*  So my focus has been primarily on scaling development. So when we say development, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1351.92s)]
*  obviously that's clinical development, it's clinical operations, it's biometrics, it's regulatory, [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1356.16s)]
*  it is DMPK, ClinFarm, these kind of functions and capabilities, you know, especially as you go [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1361.92s)]
*  beyond a phase one study and you need to start thinking about full development program. So that's [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1368.48s)]
*  been the people growth on the organization that always has this interesting tension in biotech [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1373.12s)]
*  because, you know, discovery will have been front and center for this case, five years, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1379.36s)]
*  for a while, and we've been around and now they start to see the growth and development elsewhere. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1385.1999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, what you have to do is make sure you're spending time letting discovery [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1389.76s)]
*  team know that that's still a huge source of value today than the future and maintaining [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1394.32s)]
*  excitement and motivation there while most of the growth is happening on which balance. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1399.36s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. And as far as that development side growth is concerned, what's it been like in your [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1405.04s)]
*  experience gearing up, staffing up? Like, have there been particular challenges to that? [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1410.96s)]
*  You know, I've been really lucky in the sense that I think Lado goes very well positioned for [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1418.56s)]
*  everything we've talked about and the excitement around this class that we've been able to attract [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  great talent. I know that's not always the case. And I will say that, you know, we're trying to [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1426.64s)]
*  bring in a mix of people with pain experience and not. And there isn't the depth of, you know, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1433.44s)]
*  companies working in pain to have a whole sort of people, you know, a whole set of talent that have [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1442.4s)]
*  experience in pain. Not many companies to snipe from, is that what you're saying? Exactly. Right. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1447.44s)]
*  There's not as many, but it's also less competition, you know, because I mean, [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1453.44s)]
*  from oncology, for example, like, you know, if you're an MD clinical oncology experience, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1458.24s)]
*  you're going to have 10 offers. And so we've been, I think, lucky in being able to attract people who [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1462.96s)]
*  have pain expertise across different functions, even biometrics and the like. But then I've also [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1470.96s)]
*  been, you know, cognizant about mixing in some people with capabilities in other therapeutic areas [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1476.88s)]
*  to augment this, right? Because as we think about the development and what's been interesting is a [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1484.72s)]
*  lot of people will say, well, okay, you're in pain, so you've got to go get CMS people. That's, [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1489.44s)]
*  you know, like the therapeutic area we kind of fall under, but the answer is we're actually not [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1495.68s)]
*  a CMS company, we're a science company, but, you know, it's a very different experience from [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1499.3600000000001s)]
*  if you've been working on degenerative disease, sparking symptoms, dementia, etc. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1505.92s)]
*  Actually, what I kind of want to know people who've had more primary care, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1512.88s)]
*  you know, drug development experience, right, and really understand [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1517.2s)]
*  the drug-drug interaction work, the clinical pharmacology work, you know, the [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1521.44s)]
*  scale up on the manufacturing side, etc. that we need for the kind of business. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1526.24s)]
*  Yeah. Tell us, Neha, about LTG-101 and, you know, how it works, maybe? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1530.72s)]
*  So LTG-101 is a NAV 1.8 inhibitor, so a small molecule oral compound, and it inhibits very [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1542.16s)]
*  selectively and potently NAV 1.8. So what is NAV 1.8? Why does that matter? In this case, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1549.68s)]
*  NAV sodium voltage channel 1.8, there are nine of these channels. We're targeting 1.8 very [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1556.32s)]
*  selectively. That's important because other NAV channels play other important roles in the [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1562.1599999999999s)]
*  body that you don't want to interfere. But NAV 1.8 is exclusively reserved by the body for the use of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1566.3999999999999s)]
*  propagating the pain signal from the periphery back to the world. And so whatever that pain [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1572.96s)]
*  signal may be, that could be an inflammatory brain signal, like from prostate gland and [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1577.84s)]
*  these cytokines, you know, pneucioceptive, from pressure, heat, cold. It could be neuropathic from, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1582.0s)]
*  you know, glucose damage to the nerves. All those signals that are action potential, that electrical [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1588.08s)]
*  firing is carried through this, the sodium voltage channel that helps propagate that signal back to [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1592.96s)]
*  the brain. So inhibiting that channel can reduce the perception of pain that's coming from the [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1598.48s)]
*  periphery back to the brain. And if you do that selectively without hitting other sodium channels [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1606.56s)]
*  that play important roles in the body, like 1.1, 1.5, or 1.7, then you can have a very safe [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1611.84s)]
*  infected room. Is there a danger then of the, you know, the old light hand on the stove and not the [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1618.6399999999999s)]
*  only thing? Because the frog in the boiling pot? No, for a couple reasons. One is, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1624.24s)]
*  you thought maybe you caught Neema on that? Like, wait a minute. I'll bet you didn't think about that. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1632.48s)]
*  No, I know what you thought. Yeah. No, I'm curious about why, right? Like I would have asked the same [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1642.0s)]
*  question. Yeah. First of all, this is more of going to blunt the pain than you're completely [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1648.4s)]
*  not feel pain. And you still have senses. You still can feel heat, you can feel cold, you're [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1655.84s)]
*  done. And so it does blunt pain effectively. It's not eliminating all pain. You're not going to walk [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1662.8s)]
*  around, you know, grab your hand on the stove, grab your hand on. And frankly, if we ever got to a [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1669.36s)]
*  level of energies that was that much of it, you know, and not to buy that. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1675.84s)]
*  I remarked the first time we talked a couple weeks ago that your disposition is like uncommon, like [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1684.08s)]
*  cheery and pleasant. I mean, this is a tough business that we're in. I mean, you're working [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1692.0s)]
*  in a market that has, as you mentioned, big social implications that can, you know, if you think about [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1696.48s)]
*  it long and hard, could bring you down, right? Like thinking about the opioid epidemic, for instance. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1701.52s)]
*  Well, I'm just going to totally personal question, but how do you maintain this disposition? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1708.8s)]
*  I mean, I think I have it naturally. I think I'm surprised that anyone could be a biotech CEO and [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1715.9199999999998s)]
*  not be naively optimistic all the time, because we enter a business where things fail 90% of the time. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1721.28s)]
*  I know. You think that this one's going to work. I believe. Like you got to be optimistic, right? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1726.24s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, that could be cause that, I mean, that stress, right? The acceptance of that [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1731.12s)]
*  risk could be cause for, you know, for concern enough to bring a guy down. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1735.76s)]
*  Well, it is the hardest part of the job. I had this conversation with a colleague last night [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1741.84s)]
*  was thinking about transitioning to a senior role. And, you know, obviously you have to have some [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1746.8799999999999s)]
*  level of technical capabilities and intelligence and background in drug development. So let's check [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1751.44s)]
*  the box things. And then we talked a lot about the energy you need to be a CEO, right? That's, I think, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1757.92s)]
*  clear. I think most people would say like, you just got to have energy, you got to have passion. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1764.16s)]
*  And the thing that I raised is like, here's the last part that is hard is the emotional roller [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1768.72s)]
*  coaster component. And this is a business like many businesses, but we have this binary outcomes [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1774.4s)]
*  of the data is revealed or something like that. And there's going to be ups and there's going to [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1780.3200000000002s)]
*  be downs. And, you know, I'll tell you whatever, what it's been almost 10 years as a, as a CEO [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1783.8400000000001s)]
*  in different times, you don't get better at riding that. It's still euphoric when it's high [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1788.88s)]
*  and crushing when it's low. And I think I've gotten better at all the other aspects, you know, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1797.44s)]
*  of the job over time as you learn experience, but I haven't been able to get better at that. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1803.92s)]
*  And you just have to ride the roller coaster and then, you know, to manage this somehow. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1809.2800000000002s)]
*  We talked about LTG 101. What could you tell us about, I guess, your pipeline beyond that, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1819.0400000000002s)]
*  such as it is, and any sort of plans to add additional canines? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1825.92s)]
*  Yeah. So we have a second compound in the clinic 305. That's the one we're developing for chronic. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1829.8400000000001s)]
*  The characteristics of the drug, the first compound is twice daily. The second compound [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1835.8400000000001s)]
*  is one standard that makes more sense for a human. Actually, in human sometimes [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1841.1200000000001s)]
*  twice daily dosing is actually an advantage. Patients will tend to take the drug whenever [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1847.04s)]
*  they want. So you want to, you want to have quick onset or offset so that they're not taking a one [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1852.1599999999999s)]
*  standard drug multiple times. But in chronic pain, you really would rather have one day a day dosing. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1857.84s)]
*  So that's the second compound that's in the clinic. That's the one that's in phase one that will start [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1863.84s)]
*  arthritis studies later this year. We have a third, now one, eight inhibitor that we're [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1867.6799999999998s)]
*  intending to bring into the clinic. What's exciting about that one for us is that it has [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1872.48s)]
*  the potential to have a really low dose, which gives you the opportunity to develop different [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1877.2800000000002s)]
*  formulations. And if you think about pain drugs that you would get in OTC, the opportunity to [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1882.5600000000002s)]
*  have a patch or a spray or something like that could be really interesting. To do that, you have [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1888.64s)]
*  to have a very low amount of drug. And so that's the opportunity for the third time. We are continuing [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1893.2800000000002s)]
*  to work on other pain targets. I think we're very excited about that one. We've doubled down, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1898.16s)]
*  tripled down in it as you will, but we are also working on other pain targets. We're looking at [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1902.96s)]
*  one called ASIC, which is acid sensing ion channel, which is triggered when you have acid driven pain. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1907.92s)]
*  And there are obviously certain types of pain like ischemic pain that is, cancer pain that is [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  specifically often acid driven, but also can be acid and not one hatred. So you have combination [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1921.44s)]
*  as well to better block pain. For those different delivery mechanisms that you mentioned, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1927.92s)]
*  is that something you would work on in-house? Would you partner for those kinds of... [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1934.96s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. I think those are things that we're still thinking through. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1939.2s)]
*  I think you could probably think about some early proof of concept work that you could do [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1942.48s)]
*  demonstrating bio-voluntary or the like or technical feasibility. But yes, ultimately, [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1948.08s)]
*  those are probably would benefit from having partners. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1953.76s)]
*  What have you been doing here at JPM during JPM week? What's been the agenda? [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1958.8799999999999s)]
*  Getting steps in. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1964.08s)]
*  Getting steps in. Well, I mean, yeah, that's happening regardless, right? It just comes here. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1965.6s)]
*  Yeah. Our focus, this is a great conference. I live in San Francisco, so it's always fun for me. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1970.4s)]
*  I can pop over and go home when I need to. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1976.48s)]
*  Can I ask a question? I have a hypothesis that JPMorgan week is the week that there are the most [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1978.88s)]
*  people in suits in San Francisco on the street. Is that accurate? Can you verify that? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1987.2800000000002s)]
*  I can verify that in three days here, you'll see more people in suits and you will see [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  362 days put together over 10 years the rest of the week. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=1996.64s)]
*  Okay, 10 years. Wow. Yeah. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2000.88s)]
*  Find me a hypothesis or theory. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2002.96s)]
*  100%. I mean, I would also say that over the years, it's gotten more casual. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2004.48s)]
*  I've noticed that too. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2013.2s)]
*  Student time, right? And now we moved a few years back to like, we don't have to wear ties. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2014.08s)]
*  And now a lot of people wear sneakers. And this year, I saw a lot of people [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2018.96s)]
*  lying wearing suits, jacket, blazers and sneakers. So that's definitely the term. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2022.56s)]
*  I actually felt guilty about not wearing a tie today. I wore a tie the last two days and I [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2029.0400000000002s)]
*  noticed to your point that I was near a few guys with ties on. Ben's holding out. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2035.0400000000002s)]
*  I've been going back and forth a little bit. I'm not really sure which one is the right view. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2041.0400000000002s)]
*  But I cut you off on JPMorgan. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2045.52s)]
*  JPMorgan, great conference for a couple of reasons. So one, clearly the world's investment [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2049.12s)]
*  community is here. It's a good conference for meeting for investors. But honestly, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2054.56s)]
*  there are other conferences where you have access to investors and the pretty regular cadence of [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2058.32s)]
*  those. This is one of the few conferences where you can access strategic farming companies and not [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2062.24s)]
*  just business development teams, but senior executives. And so that's really unique about [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2070.0s)]
*  this. And so the opportunity certainly to have conversations with strategic is a focus and [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2075.92s)]
*  unique for this week. Are those senior executives generally resumming? That's the expectation of [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2082.72s)]
*  them while they're here and how do you access them? Certainly the thing with the senior [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2088.8799999999997s)]
*  executives here in pharma is that they kind of have a million options to pick from and they'll [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2096.08s)]
*  kind of go with what strikes their fancy. You can try to work with your colleagues in the business [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2100.24s)]
*  development team and see if there's enough excitement to get a C-suite executive to pop [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  into your meeting. Sometimes they do come, sometimes they don't come. I think it'd be fun [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2109.84s)]
*  to be a pharma executive. I can just be like looking at the calendar through the day and like, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2114.6400000000003s)]
*  I want to get that one, that one, that one, I want to get half of this one. But that's kind of how it [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2117.28s)]
*  works. It is still speed dating, but it's still a unique kind of access. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2121.36s)]
*  interest in certain therapeutic areas, it swings back and forth. Different things become hot, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2129.04s)]
*  different things aren't. When there was a lot of reporting on opioid deaths and the CDC changed [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2136.16s)]
*  its guidance, I think there was a huge focus on non-opioid pain medications and a recognition [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2142.56s)]
*  of the need for them. Do you have a sense that that sentiment still exists and is still just [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2149.6s)]
*  as strong? Has it decreased? Has it increased? Yeah, it's a great point because I mean, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2157.3599999999997s)]
*  we're seeing a national decrease in the number of opioid deaths, right? Certainly locally and [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2162.6400000000003s)]
*  nationally. And a lot of people are asserting that it's related to these efforts to reduce [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2166.7200000000003s)]
*  opioid prescriptions. And so we can look at it one of two ways. One is like, it's getting better, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2174.48s)]
*  we don't have to focus on it. Or no, what we've been doing is actually working and we should keep [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2181.92s)]
*  doubling down and pushing up because it's not like opioid deaths are down maybe 20% from [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2186.8s)]
*  last year. They have disappeared. But they have disappeared. It's still many X what they were 10 [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2191.68s)]
*  or 15, 20 years ago. So I think that the latter is where I'm hopeful and I believe it is, which is [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2196.08s)]
*  these interventions that we've been putting in place are starting to work. Let's continue [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2202.08s)]
*  and continue to double down and we're seeing that snowballing. And I think we're going to see [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2206.48s)]
*  continued decrease in dependency, opioid dependency translating to a lot of the societal [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2211.52s)]
*  levels that we see related to that as other non-opioid pain medicines become available. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2220.64s)]
*  I think they'll become even greater incentive to be like, look, it's been working already. Now we [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2227.68s)]
*  have even more therapeutic options. We should be even stricter about letting opioids be used. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2230.96s)]
*  Why should we have, why should we even be allowed to have opioids be prescribed for low risk [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2235.8399999999997s)]
*  surgical prescriptions? Why should we send an 18 to 20 year old child, young adult back to their [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2240.96s)]
*  college dorm with a bunch of opioids after wisdom teeth extraction? We probably shouldn't let that [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2247.68s)]
*  happen. Yeah. I would imagine payers that would think about it the same way. Right. And when more [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2254.3199999999997s)]
*  therapies become available, I would think that there would be a pretty strong push to prevent [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2260.08s)]
*  people from getting hooked to an opioid because it's costly. It's costly. And it's really easy [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2266.08s)]
*  to focus on and we should on the dependence component of opioids. But there are other issues [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2272.24s)]
*  with opioids. Right. So obviously there is the nausea and constipation that they're well known [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2276.96s)]
*  for, but also just intuitively the CNS, the somnolence, the being out of it. Right. And the [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2281.44s)]
*  impact that has. So one of the anecdotes that I was hearing is how surgeons are really looking [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2288.32s)]
*  forward to an additional non-opioid to add to the mix and reduce opioid use. Because if you think [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2295.12s)]
*  about how they're measured, it's often 30 day mortality morbidity of surgery. And if the surgery [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2301.68s)]
*  goes great, but you give someone an opioid, especially someone more elderly and they're out [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2307.9199999999996s)]
*  of it and they have a fall, that's actually one of the things that brings people back into [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2312.48s)]
*  hospital and that counts against your mortality morbidity on that operation. Right. So there are [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2316.96s)]
*  a lot of concerns with opioids. The dependence is the obvious one. But even if you don't become [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2322.08s)]
*  dependent, you're not very functional. Yeah. And are you finding that that sort of the nuance of [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2328.4s)]
*  that story is being well received as well? Yeah. Is it just a big story that resonates? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2337.12s)]
*  Yeah. I'd say that we're finding greater traction on the nuance of the story as people start to be [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2343.84s)]
*  like, no, I actually, maybe this is a real opportunity. But there are so a lot of people [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2350.32s)]
*  who will say like, it's not about opioid replacement. They're generic. The acute [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2354.2400000000002s)]
*  market's small and cares about these things. It'll be whether you develop a big neuropathic [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2358.56s)]
*  or musculoskeletal problem. I think this opportunity to replace opioids for all these [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2364.32s)]
*  scenarios you're talking about is. Yeah. Well, I mean, the cost of generic opioids, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2370.2400000000002s)]
*  I think it's been one of the challenges that overcome for alternatives. Right. I mean, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2376.56s)]
*  how do you have to develop a medicine that is not so much more expensive that an insurance [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2381.12s)]
*  company, for example, may end up choosing an opioid over your new drug that is not going to [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2388.96s)]
*  potentially get someone addicted and put them into a fog and cause them to fall and all sorts of [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2395.6s)]
*  other things. That's right. I mean, look, you can make all those arguments that we just made about [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2399.8399999999997s)]
*  that. You can have regulatory and government policy pressures to not let people just take [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2403.04s)]
*  the easy way out with the cheaper drug that has all these impacts. And you can also think about [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2411.68s)]
*  the big picture. If I've walked in, for most procedures, the range of cost, it's a 10, 15, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2416.16s)]
*  20,000, maybe $30,000 procedure on the go. And then for the cost of a [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2423.92s)]
*  $30 to $40 a day drug for a week, you're going to put them on an opioid. In the context of the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2431.68s)]
*  surgery, it's a very small percentage of the expense. We got a pretty good lay of the clinical [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2439.04s)]
*  plan for let it go. Let's go post show next week. You're back in the office. Next steps, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2446.64s)]
*  big thing you're working on, what's on your agenda? [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2454.0s)]
*  Yeah, sleep. Same. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2457.84s)]
*  Same. But no, but seriously- [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2461.76s)]
*  Take a few non-opioid analgesics and put them out. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2464.8s)]
*  That's right. I think a couple of things. One is the engagement you have with investors and [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2468.48s)]
*  strategics at a meeting like this is a two-way street. So one, obviously we're telling our story, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2475.52s)]
*  but we're hearing feedback about like, here's how we would do things. Here's how we think about [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2481.04s)]
*  things. So I can just debrief with my team at London today. And we have four or five things [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2484.4s)]
*  we want to explore in some detail about how should we look at that potential indication? What would a [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2489.04s)]
*  proof of concept look like in that idea? What kind of study can we run? How do we want to think about [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2495.2s)]
*  this timing of the study? So there's some of these concrete things. And actually, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2500.48s)]
*  it can be draining as a CEO to be constantly doing the pitch. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2505.6s)]
*  You know, but you can get feedback back that's useful. And in an event like this, you do. So [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2509.4399999999996s)]
*  there are a few things that we want to explore. So that's the kind of unique thing coming out [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2515.2799999999997s)]
*  of the conference. The other thing, of course, is between the holidays and JP Morgan, just getting [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2519.9199999999996s)]
*  back into good operational planning, tracking our objectives, and being back in the flow of the [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2523.68s)]
*  operations. Also same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We find ourselves just [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2533.2799999999997s)]
*  rolling right out of the holidays into JPM. Then we get back and it's like, okay, let's get grounded. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2538.88s)]
*  Let's get grounded. Yeah. Well, that's about all the time we have for today. But there's so much [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2543.92s)]
*  more to talk about. We'd love to have you back on the show at some point to talk about what's [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2550.56s)]
*  going on there and clinical progress. I appreciate you taking time out of your super busy schedule [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2554.8s)]
*  to spend with us. This has been great. I enjoyed it. Yeah. So if we... Thank you. Thank you. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2560.1600000000003s)]
*  So that's Latigo Therapeutics CEO, Nina Faustin. I'm Matt Piller. And I'm Dave Bummer. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qENr3SUL8fM&t=2566.0800000000004s)]
