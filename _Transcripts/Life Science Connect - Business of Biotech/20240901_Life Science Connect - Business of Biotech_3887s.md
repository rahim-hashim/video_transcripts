Video Description: This week, it’s another “Business of Biotech-meets-Business-of-RNA” takeover with Circio CEO Erik Digman Wiklund, Ph.D. and guest co-host Anna Rose Welch of Advancing RNA. While Circio’s legacy is in cancer immunology (it still boasts a cancer vaccine candidate targeting KRAS driver mutations), the company made a bold pivot, of sorts, when it committed headlong to the circular RNA future. Now, it’s in the throes of fine-tuning a platform for the development of novel circRNA medicines for rare disease, vaccines, and cancer. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, we go deep inside the story behind the pivot, we explore the RNA therapeutic platform-versus-product appetite among biotech investors, and Dr. Digman Wiklund shares insights into the challenges his company overcame to enable such a dramatic shift in focus.

# Pivoting To RNA With Circio's Dr. Erik Digman Wiklund
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c)
*  In the business of biotech, adaptability is requisite because sometimes, in fact, oftentimes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=0.0s)]
*  you have to pivot. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=10.26s)]
*  Things like an unfavorable readout, a lost investor, a shortening runway, a pandemic, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=12.44s)]
*  or an abysmal capital market are likely to force a pivot. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=19.14s)]
*  No wonder that so many biotech builders pivot begrudgingly only when they have no other [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=23.26s)]
*  choice. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=28.82s)]
*  It's better in their hand, perhaps, forced by a board. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=29.82s)]
*  Better in my opinion to be a proactive and optimistic pivoter, one who embraces the pivot [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=33.18s)]
*  and who pivots not in the direction of the path of least resistance, but in the direction [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=39.6s)]
*  of the path of most opportunity. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=44.32s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  And I'm Anna Rose Welch. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=48.56s)]
*  And on this, yet another RNA-centric episode of the business of biotech, we're talking [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=50.04s)]
*  with a Renaissance man who's been busy perfecting the pivot. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=55.18s)]
*  Dr. Eric Digmund-Wickland is CEO at Cirqueo, a circular RNA developer that's the product [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=59.32s)]
*  of a recent pivot that we'll learn about today, but we'll also learn about some of Eric's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=66.17999999999999s)]
*  preceding pivots and those he sees coming next as RNA and the circular variety of RNA [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=70.58s)]
*  continue to make waves in the space. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=78.06s)]
*  Anna Rose, I don't know if I've ever ... If you counted all the times that I said pivot [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=80.69999999999999s)]
*  in my life, I don't think I've said it as many times as I have. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=84.69999999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to lie, there were moments there that felt almost Shakespearean. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=88.14s)]
*  The cadence of your words were very poetic. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=92.14s)]
*  Let's pivot to Dr. Digmund-Wickland. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=95.34s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=97.54s)]
*  Eric, it's a pleasure to have you here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=99.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=102.06s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=103.06s)]
*  It's great to have you. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=104.64s)]
*  And as you know, I like to start these conversations off with some background for context on the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=105.64s)]
*  perspectives of my guests. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=114.06s)]
*  So I want to rewind a little bit and start with you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=116.88s)]
*  It's not uncommon for me to interview biotech builders who began their careers at McKinsey. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=119.64s)]
*  In fact, just a couple of weeks ago, I was at a conference having a conversation with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=126.84s)]
*  Udit Batra, who's the CEO at Waters, former CEO at Millipore Sigma. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=132.92s)]
*  He started at McKinsey. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=137.72s)]
*  There are probably ... I could probably count like a dozen guests that I've had on the podcast [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=139.84s)]
*  who started their careers at McKinsey. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's interesting to hear about how that perspective, that early perspective, kind [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=148.8s)]
*  of shaped the worldview and the next steps for the biotech builders that have started [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=153.0s)]
*  there. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=159.84s)]
*  So tell us about that experience from your perspective. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=160.84s)]
*  I think McKinsey or the McKinsey training that you get is particularly suited for the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=163.36s)]
*  biotech industry. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  That's because when you're at McKinsey, you're sort of forced to work on a lot of different [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=172.6s)]
*  topics, often for a short period of time, and you jump around. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=177.88s)]
*  So whereas as a scientist, I'm a trained molecular biologist, there you go really deep on something. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=182.36s)]
*  You need to get all the details right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=187.68s)]
*  And once you step out of that and go into management consulting in a place like McKinsey, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=191.16s)]
*  it's the opposite in many ways. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  You need to quickly figure something out and you need to move from one topic to the next. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=198.12s)]
*  So I think you learn to structure and analyze information in a quicker way and get up to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  speed more quickly. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=212.32s)]
*  And you need to be willing to do some hands-on work yourself. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=215.16s)]
*  I think that drives very well with being a biotech executive and CEO because one, you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=218.88s)]
*  need to be strategic. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=225.32000000000002s)]
*  You need to understand a lot of different areas. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=226.52s)]
*  You need to understand everything from manufacturing, regulatory, preclinical development, clinical [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  trial design. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=233.24s)]
*  You're involved in absolutely everything. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=234.24s)]
*  And you also need to roll up your sleeves and do a lot of the actual hands-on work yourself. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's probably more lost in a larger corporation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=241.52s)]
*  You probably stick more to your department. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=245.52s)]
*  When you're at a strategic level, you may no longer actually do so much hands-on work [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  yourself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=253.52s)]
*  Maybe that's why a lot of McKinsey people like the biotech world because it gives you [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=254.68s)]
*  this opportunity to be involved in everything, wear many hats. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=260.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=264.56s)]
*  I mentioned from the outset that you're a Renaissance man. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=265.56s)]
*  It occurs to me that your proclivity to explore expanded horizons was probably built into [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=270.0s)]
*  you prior to your time at McKinsey because when I look at your resume, so to speak, like [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=277.76s)]
*  your LinkedIn profile, you left McKinsey to lead post-acquisition integration of Algeida [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  into Bayer. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=291.44s)]
*  And it seems like, okay, well, this guy is solidly on track to be a dealmaker in biotech. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  But your next position after that was in product development with a krill-based nutrition supplement [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=298.88s)]
*  company. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=304.2s)]
*  You did that while simultaneously founding and launching a dinner kit cooking concept. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=305.2s)]
*  Which is amazing. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=311.64s)]
*  That's just awesome. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  All the while running a successful, of all things, photography business. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=316.0s)]
*  So it begs the question, like anyone looking at your CV is going to go like, well, what [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  was this departure on Dr. Diggman-Wicklund's trajectory? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=326.32s)]
*  Maybe you can tell that I have a lot of different interests and I like doing different things. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=331.15999999999997s)]
*  That's probably why I didn't stay in academia and in science and went into industry. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=335.84s)]
*  I went to Algeida, as you said, after McKinsey. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=340.92s)]
*  And my role there was initially in strategic planning of manufacturing for the future. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=347.04s)]
*  And then quickly the Bayer acquisition came up. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=352.36s)]
*  I'd spent significant time at Bayer during my consulting years. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=355.76s)]
*  I knew that organization well. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=360.44s)]
*  So I think that's why I was selected to do this integration project between the two organizations. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  I also learned from my time as a consultant that I'm much more of an entrepreneurial [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=370.2s)]
*  person than a big corporation person. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=375.64s)]
*  So I also kind of knew that I didn't want to stick around there. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=378.44s)]
*  So I could say I integrated myself out of the resulting merged entity in Norway. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=383.08s)]
*  But overall, that merger was very successful. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=392.12s)]
*  To this day, Bayer retains a substantial, I think, two-thirds of the team in Algeida. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=397.28s)]
*  They've put their radio pharma research hub in Norway. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=402.24s)]
*  So we were able to make sure that a lot of the value was retained in Norway. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=405.71999999999997s)]
*  The manufacturing is still retained in Norway. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=409.2s)]
*  But I then went on to other things, as you said. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=412.4s)]
*  My plan actually was to not have a boss again. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=415.56s)]
*  So I decided, look, I'll try and start some projects on my own. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=419.4s)]
*  I can work when I feel like it instead of having a boss. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=425.68s)]
*  And I had six months garden leave and salary anyway from Bayer. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  So then I started a few things off. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  I'd always been a keen photographer and worked on that. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=438.0s)]
*  So I professionalized this. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=441.16s)]
*  That was a way to earn some revenue fast because I can take wedding photography jobs and these kinds of things. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=443.8s)]
*  I do that with my wife, so it's a fun thing we do together. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=452.2s)]
*  And I started this dinner kit concept simply because actually, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  selection in grocery stores in Norway is terrible. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=460.36s)]
*  So we wanted to make a food concept suitable for people who want to eat good food and busy lifestyles with kids. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=463.4s)]
*  So we started that with four of my friends. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=473.64s)]
*  And that's still a thriving business. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=478.12s)]
*  I'm no longer operationally involved, but I chaired a board and help out in fundraising. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=480.0s)]
*  And the company is doing well. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=485.12s)]
*  And I set up also a consulting business to do projects. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=489.40000000000003s)]
*  And that consulting business is what led me into the krill arena. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=493.48s)]
*  Some former McKinsey colleagues worked in an Omega 3 company in Norway. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=498.08s)]
*  So in Norway, pharma and biotech is a really tiny, tiny industry. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=502.44s)]
*  Energy, seafood, these are the large industries in Norway. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=508.91999999999996s)]
*  So I also thought maybe it makes sense to position myself a bit more towards seafood and nutrition simply because it's a bigger market, more jobs available in Norway. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=514.3199999999999s)]
*  So I started off taking some projects and that eventually evolved into a full time role with the krill company. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=523.68s)]
*  I actually think to make protein powder for sports nutrition from krill. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=533.68s)]
*  That was the project we were working on. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=542.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  No, that's really cool. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=547.0s)]
*  What was the catalyst for your return to biotech? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=548.04s)]
*  So a bunch of people who had been at Algeta sort of got scattered around, including the CFO who I worked closely with at Algeta. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=553.92s)]
*  And he then later became the CEO of the predecessor company to Circo, which is called Targovax, which is an immunotherapy company. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=564.1999999999999s)]
*  So he took over that company in 2016. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=573.3199999999999s)]
*  And in 2017, he was looking for a CFO and contacted me. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=576.84s)]
*  So then basically, that was too difficult to tear down. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  Some old colleagues. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=585.72s)]
*  At that time, immunotherapy was super hot. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=587.56s)]
*  We were developing an oncologic virus, which was also in vogue. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=590.88s)]
*  And even though I've been doing a bunch of different things, I've always, since I was a research scientist, I envisaged that at one point in my career, I'd want to be a biotech CEO. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=594.48s)]
*  Seemed like a really fun thing to do. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=606.12s)]
*  And I've kept that in mind, sort of make career decisions that could move me in that direction. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=609.04s)]
*  So when a CFO role came around, I thought that was a great opportunity to learn some more of the finance ropes. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=614.0799999999999s)]
*  Plus, I knew the CEO well. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=623.88s)]
*  He had been the CFO of Algeta, but a non-scientist. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=625.76s)]
*  So we had this kind of symbiosis where we could learn from each other. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=630.0s)]
*  I could, he was a mentor in terms of the finance and fundraising aspects. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=633.52s)]
*  And I could be supportive on the science side for him as a discussion partner. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=639.8s)]
*  So that's how I ended up in coming back to biotech and oncology in the end, after all. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=648.76s)]
*  Even though I purposely tried to get out of it for a while. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=654.8s)]
*  All the way to Krill. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=661.04s)]
*  You went all the way to the oceans. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=663.52s)]
*  So you came back and the ride, the roller coaster ride was far from over. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=665.9599999999999s)]
*  You came back to Targovax. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=672.56s)]
*  Tell us a little bit about how Targovax evolved in the in the Serkiel. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=673.88s)]
*  So when I joined Targovax, the company was the result of a merger between a Norwegian cancer vaccine company and a company in Finland developing an oncolytic virus. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=681.24s)]
*  So these companies were put together to create a bit more critical mass. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=693.16s)]
*  They fundraised, got off to a pretty good start and ran an exploratory trial, phase one to trial program, which had been that was starting when I joined. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=697.68s)]
*  And so the first part of the time at Targovax was to execute these clinical studies, get the readouts and then move the company on. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=711.84s)]
*  Now, I think what happened is that both cancer vaccines and oncolytic virus, which is what we were developing, went a bit out of favor. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=725.48s)]
*  Cancer vaccines and maybe having a bit of a renaissance now, but unfortunately, several clinical failures made it very difficult to finance. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=735.8s)]
*  So it's difficult to excite investors, even though we had good data. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  And then in the middle of the development, we were we were focusing that cancer vaccine, that's a vaccine targeting K-RAS mutations in the resected pancreatic cancer setting. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=751.4s)]
*  And right in the middle, when we were planning our phase two program, the standard of care changed, dramatically extending the expected survival. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=764.28s)]
*  So we were then looking at having to do a survival trial where expected median survival would be between four and five years. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=779.36s)]
*  And that was just impossible to fundraise for. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=790.56s)]
*  So we would just put our vaccine on top of whatever was the standard of care. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=793.08s)]
*  But you can't get an investor to put money into such a program where it's going to take six, seven years before you have a definitive readout. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=796.0s)]
*  So that kind of pulled the rug under that program a little and we had to step back. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=803.5200000000001s)]
*  And as we did that, we realized we need to pick a new indication and restart phase one in many ways. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=809.48s)]
*  We also decided to upgrade the product itself. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=816.64s)]
*  So we took two years to modify both the formulation, the adjuvant we used, as well as find other combination strategies and then put it back into patients last year. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=820.16s)]
*  So now that program is actually returned. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=834.6s)]
*  And I think cancer vaccines are a bit more in favor these days. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=836.48s)]
*  So that's been resurrected. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=840.12s)]
*  The other program, the Oncolytic Virus program, that was really when we started a field that was very much involved. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=845.24s)]
*  People were quite excited about Oncolytic Viruses, but then slowly there were readouts that were negative. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=853.32s)]
*  TVEC from Amgen hasn't performed commercially as well as was anticipated. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=858.64s)]
*  And people became really skeptical. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=865.5600000000001s)]
*  So I think what happens is the burden of evidence required to move on or get fundraising or a partner changes or becomes more substantial. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=869.6s)]
*  So when the program was started, this was hot stuff. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=883.12s)]
*  So people let's just do a quick trial, 20 patients, get a signal, then we can partner out the program. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=886.6800000000001s)]
*  That was the thinking. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=891.88s)]
*  But when that work was done, people wanted to see 100 patient data, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  preferably randomized data to be able to make a decision because a small trial simply didn't cut it. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=898.0799999999999s)]
*  Even though we had strong data, I would say, it wasn't a large enough data set or robust enough that we could get sufficient interests to pursue it. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=907.1999999999999s)]
*  And then unfortunately, we just had to pull the plug on that program. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=918.8399999999999s)]
*  So where did circular RNA come in? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=924.0s)]
*  This is the how did you end up in the in this gene therapy world? [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=926.5200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so the three years ago, the company was in this situation where it was becoming clear that it was difficult to pursue the Oncolytic Virus program. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=931.0400000000001s)]
*  The next step had a price tag of around 50 million dollars. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=942.84s)]
*  The trial that needed to be done and associated CMC work, we were able to fundraise maybe a third or half of that. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=949.16s)]
*  But then we decided, look, it's doing another sort of half baked, not properly sized program. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=958.3199999999999s)]
*  We know it's going to be hard to partner this out. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=965.36s)]
*  It's only worthwhile if you really do it. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=967.4s)]
*  You can give it your all, right? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=970.1999999999999s)]
*  If you can actually give it your all. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  We could have done another 40 patients to a single arm trial, gotten some signals. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=973.52s)]
*  But I don't think it would have moved the needle. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=978.8s)]
*  That was one aspect. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=981.68s)]
*  And also at that time, our cancer vaccine was not in any active trials. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=982.52s)]
*  So the board was discussing, is it better to throw in the towel? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=987.5999999999999s)]
*  What to do now? [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=992.28s)]
*  We still had some funding left. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=993.04s)]
*  And at that time, I of course, I worked on circular RNA back when I was a researcher and published some of the very early circular RNA papers together with [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=996.3199999999999s)]
*  a very talented colleague of mine, Thomas Hansen. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1008.8399999999999s)]
*  And we published an initial paper in 2011. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1013.16s)]
*  And after that, it became this big thing. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1016.92s)]
*  So this evolved into big fields. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1018.36s)]
*  So I sort of tracked over the years. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1021.48s)]
*  And then in 2019, it was shown that you could use circular RNA to make express proteins in vivo. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1023.6s)]
*  And then in 2021, which is just a few months before we were in this situation, Orna had launched with their synthetic circular RNA program. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1031.68s)]
*  And Laron followed closely thereafter with a massive financing round. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1041.88s)]
*  So suddenly, circular RNA was this ultra hot thing, which I then naturally wanted to get into. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1045.68s)]
*  So I pitched this to the board. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1052.5600000000002s)]
*  I said, look, I know circular RNA. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1057.44s)]
*  I can recruit Thomas, who is our sort of founding scientist of this field and is very knowledgeable. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1060.64s)]
*  And we can build a circular RNA company instead of pursuing these legacy immunotherapy assets. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  And the initial thinking was that we could use the viral vector we had. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1074.76s)]
*  So for the oncologic virus program is based on an adenovirus. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1078.24s)]
*  So we had substantial adenovirus knowledge in-house. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1082.16s)]
*  We had access to a clinically validated vector. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1085.64s)]
*  And the initial idea was to make that adenovirus express circular RNA. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1090.48s)]
*  And circular RNA has the advantage of being more durable. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1096.4s)]
*  It'll hang around in the cell for longer and it makes more proteins. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1098.48s)]
*  So we thought this would be an interesting tool to use to make a virus for cancer that can express a therapeutic payload at higher levels for longer. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1101.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1112.52s)]
*  And that was I had two conditions to take the job in 2021. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1113.68s)]
*  And that was one that we move in this circular RNA direction and two that I could recruit Thomas to the company, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1119.24s)]
*  because it would be impossible without having someone with deep scientific knowledge. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1126.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. You wanted to return to your roots. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1130.3200000000002s)]
*  You really needed to. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1134.4s)]
*  So rather than the pivot, it was maybe a circle coming. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1135.96s)]
*  You respected a former interest. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  Fantastic. Now I have to go back and re-record the interview. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1144.0s)]
*  I know. You can't use Renath's OXFORD anymore. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1146.0800000000002s)]
*  Stop seeing pivots, Thomas. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1149.24s)]
*  It occurred to me as I was bearing through this conversation that we did last week, we did an episode. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1150.6399999999999s)]
*  I think it was the second one that Anna Rose joined me on that was RNA focused with radar therapeutics. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1159.6399999999999s)]
*  And I didn't give you like for listeners who are like maybe missed the first time you recorded with me, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1165.08s)]
*  I never gave them an opportunity to like understand why you're here. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1170.56s)]
*  I just decided to jump into the room. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1173.76s)]
*  We made a... [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1179.52s)]
*  I think on that first episode, I think I made it clear like from now on, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1180.52s)]
*  whenever I'm interviewing someone from an RNA company, I'm going to... [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1185.0s)]
*  I'm an interloper. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1188.52s)]
*  An RNA interloper. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1189.96s)]
*  Anna Rose is the...she's the community director and she said...what is your title? [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1192.28s)]
*  That's an excellent question. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1198.12s)]
*  She runs... [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1199.6399999999999s)]
*  I'm the editorial and community director for Advancing RNA, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1201.16s)]
*  which is one of the newest Life Science Connect publications. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1204.44s)]
*  So we focus on all things RNA. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1207.56s)]
*  Predominantly, I focus on the encoding modalities. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1210.44s)]
*  So your linear self-amplifying and your circular RNA. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1214.44s)]
*  But we also do cater to and are always looking for content on the non-coding side of the industry as well. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1218.04s)]
*  There you go. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1225.48s)]
*  So I made the decision that anytime I had an opportunity to speak with someone from the RNA world, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1226.2s)]
*  Anna Rose was going to join me and then... [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1232.6799999999998s)]
*  I think I kind of forced his hand on me. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1234.2s)]
*  Anna Rose made... [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1235.56s)]
*  Fid too. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1236.6s)]
*  Unbeknownst to me, she made the decision she was going to start feeding me RNA companies [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1237.32s)]
*  so that she could take over the business of biotech. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1241.08s)]
*  So if any RNA companies are listening, please pitch us. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1243.8s)]
*  I will fight for you. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1249.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1250.28s)]
*  So now I let Anna Rose come in and ask questions specific to the RNA space. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1252.36s)]
*  But I'd be...I'd really like to kind of dig into as well. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1257.08s)]
*  So one of the things you were talking about is you were... [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1259.8s)]
*  First of all, you wanted to return to your roots in the circular RNA space, right? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1262.2s)]
*  You wanted to kind of continue the research in that with Thomas. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1265.32s)]
*  But it also sounds like you saw a lot of benefits to sort of integrating it into [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1269.3999999999999s)]
*  the viral vector space, gene therapy space, right? [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1274.84s)]
*  So I'd be curious to understand a little bit more of your interest in jumping into the gene [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1277.96s)]
*  therapy space. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1285.32s)]
*  Where were some of the biggest limitations that you were seeing? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1286.04s)]
*  Where did you really find that there was a good window for you guys as a circular RNA company [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1289.08s)]
*  to start playing in the AAV gene therapy world? [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1295.24s)]
*  So like I said, we started off with an oncology angle and the company really by background [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1302.68s)]
*  is an immunotherapy company. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1309.5600000000002s)]
*  And we wanted to leverage this adenoviral platform. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1311.96s)]
*  And the initial idea was to express in tumors, so make cancer therapeutics, [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1314.68s)]
*  leveraging the circular RNA. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1322.8400000000001s)]
*  And at that point, no one had moved in that direction yet. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1324.12s)]
*  So largely a virgin territory. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1330.36s)]
*  So first of all, what you need is to build an expression construct that makes circular RNA. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1333.08s)]
*  And if you start from linear DNA, so the viral genome is linear DNA and you need to put the [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1339.4799999999998s)]
*  recipe inside of that DNA so that the RNA that is transcribed circularizes. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1345.3999999999999s)]
*  So that's where we needed to start. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1351.5600000000002s)]
*  And in nature, this is quite an inefficient process. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1354.2s)]
*  I think it's been estimated that in a natural circular RNA locus in a human cell, for example, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1359.0s)]
*  only about 5% of the RNA will actually circularize. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1366.52s)]
*  Other 95% gets degraded or have some other function. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1372.3600000000001s)]
*  So in order to make sufficient circular RNA, it took quite substantial work to optimize the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1375.88s)]
*  structure, design, sequences. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1383.0800000000002s)]
*  And over time, we've improved this at least tenfold. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1385.64s)]
*  So we built what we call CERCVEC. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1390.52s)]
*  This is a genetic cassette, double-stranded DNA that you can put into anything that is a [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1392.6000000000001s)]
*  DNA or viral DNA format and it will make circular RNA inside of a cell. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1397.5600000000002s)]
*  So that's the fundamental technology that we developed. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1402.52s)]
*  Now that's sort of independent of where you utilize it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1405.32s)]
*  So the story we first told was that we were going to use this when we went to investors [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1409.08s)]
*  and partners. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1413.96s)]
*  Now we're going to use this circular RNA expression technology to make better oncolytic viruses [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1414.52s)]
*  because we were an oncolytic virus company. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1419.8799999999999s)]
*  But I think we underestimated the negativity of the oncolytic virus modality. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1423.96s)]
*  And then people saw us as, oh, so you're not a circular RNA company, you're just a turbo-charged [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1429.24s)]
*  oncolytic virus company. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1435.88s)]
*  I thought still that would be pretty cool. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1438.2s)]
*  I mean, that's a great branding. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1439.72s)]
*  We're turbo-charged. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1442.68s)]
*  I mean, come on. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1443.72s)]
*  It was difficult to get anyone sufficiently enthusiastic about that idea. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1446.04s)]
*  And then the more data we generated and demonstrated, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1450.6s)]
*  expression advantage, longer durability compared to expressing from mRNA, higher expression level. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1455.08s)]
*  I mean, we get about 10 times higher protein outputs simply by switching from linear mRNA [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1461.08s)]
*  to circular mRNA when expressing a reporter or whatever. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1467.56s)]
*  And in mouse models, we see several months of longer duration. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1472.12s)]
*  So once we start showing this data to people, they say, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1477.32s)]
*  forget about cancer here. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1480.04s)]
*  This you should deploy for gene therapy. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1482.76s)]
*  So our pivot to gene therapy was to a large degree driven by this demand from companies [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1485.08s)]
*  and investors we spoke to just telling us that, look, guys, this is something I would really [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1491.72s)]
*  like to see being deployed in the gene therapy setting. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1496.52s)]
*  And then, of course, it makes sense. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1500.6s)]
*  The biggest hurdle in gene therapy is, besides the delivery aspect, is getting sufficient [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1502.84s)]
*  protein expression for good enough durability. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1508.92s)]
*  So anything you could do to boost that expression is going to be an advantage. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1512.2s)]
*  And I know Tom Barnes, the former CEO of Oral Therapeutics, you had on the podcast. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1519.4s)]
*  And he said that he was convinced that everyone over time is going to switch from in vitro [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1525.0800000000002s)]
*  transcribed mRNA to circular RNA, LMP packaged circular RNA. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1533.88s)]
*  Because it's simpler to make, it's cheaper to make, it's more durable, it's going to [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1538.52s)]
*  make more protein. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1542.44s)]
*  It's at least so far, there is no evidence that should suggest that you would, once this is [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1544.36s)]
*  firmly established technology, why would you would stay with mRNA? [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1551.32s)]
*  Everyone's going to switch. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1554.12s)]
*  It seems obvious. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1555.24s)]
*  And I think you can extend that to any virus or DNA-based therapeutic in the future. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1557.0s)]
*  Everyone will switch from linear mRNA to circular mRNA. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1562.92s)]
*  Everyone is going to switch from mRNA-expressing vectors to circular RNA-expressing vectors, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1567.08s)]
*  because they will make more protein with better durability. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1572.52s)]
*  And hopefully reduce the dose to reduce the amount of vibrance you need. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1576.4399999999998s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1580.84s)]
*  And coming back to your initial question on the AAV. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1582.36s)]
*  So one of the biggest caveats of AAV gene therapy today is that you need to give really [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1585.32s)]
*  high doses. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1590.52s)]
*  To get sufficient protein expression, you need to give these massive viral loads that [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1591.24s)]
*  drives up toxicity, can be lethal in some situations, increases manufacturing cost and [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1595.88s)]
*  complexity. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1601.08s)]
*  Now, if you simply make the switch where instead of expressing your genetic payload in the AAV [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1602.84s)]
*  from mRNA, it's expressed from circular RNA, and that helps you boost the protein output, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1610.68s)]
*  that would be a massive advantage. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1616.04s)]
*  And our data suggests that we can get to 10, 20, maybe a hundred-fold better protein output [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1617.56s)]
*  from an AAV. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1625.0s)]
*  If you can reduce the dose of AAV gene therapy by tenfold, that would be a big thing. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1627.08s)]
*  That would mean lower cost, more accessible to patients, and suddenly you can treat more [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1631.8799999999999s)]
*  diseases. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1636.4399999999998s)]
*  So you heard it here first. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1638.4399999999998s)]
*  You may soon be editorial and community director of Advancing Circular RNA, because that will [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1639.6399999999999s)]
*  be no way. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1645.32s)]
*  This is the point. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1646.6799999999998s)]
*  Many flavors, Matt. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1647.7199999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1648.76s)]
*  I want to get you wrapped up in the high. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1649.3999999999999s)]
*  I want to back up just a little bit, though. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1652.2s)]
*  You made an interesting point. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1654.3600000000001s)]
*  You said you'll do this on two conditions. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1655.24s)]
*  One, circular RNA is going to be the focus, and two, you bring Thomas along with you. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1658.44s)]
*  And this was pre-data. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1662.52s)]
*  We know that data drives confidence in the investor community, in the scientific community, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1663.64s)]
*  in your own internal community. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1670.6000000000001s)]
*  But when you made the decision to make this change, the circle or pivot, however you want [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1673.48s)]
*  to look at it now. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1679.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1680.6s)]
*  It was pre-data. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1682.12s)]
*  So I'm curious, from a business leadership standpoint, what other resistance you may [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  have faced and had to work through prior to having that data that generated the direction, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1688.9199999999998s)]
*  right? [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1695.0s)]
*  That created the impetus for, OK, this is where we're going to go with this. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1695.24s)]
*  What other resistance did you have to overcome, and how did you overcome it? [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1698.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1702.52s)]
*  So the parent company that initially owns Targovax and that owns these immunotherapy [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1704.76s)]
*  programs is listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in Norway. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1712.6s)]
*  That was listed in 2017, 2016. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1716.04s)]
*  So it had been on the stock exchange for a long time. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1719.6399999999999s)]
*  And of course, there were many tired investors because they had invested in clinical stage [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1722.04s)]
*  programs. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1725.88s)]
*  And these had kind of, I wouldn't say failed data-wise, but not materialized into later [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1727.4s)]
*  stage development. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1735.5600000000002s)]
*  And the share price had fallen. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1736.5200000000002s)]
*  And there's not a lot of sophisticated biotech investors in Norway. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1739.88s)]
*  It's hard enough to understand the clinical stage program. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1744.7600000000002s)]
*  But when we come then, suddenly now we're a company working on an early RNA platform. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1748.0400000000002s)]
*  And that generated, I think, a disconnect with the shareholders we had at the time. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1753.96s)]
*  And also when you're listed, I think most listed companies, at least when you've been [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1764.5200000000002s)]
*  listed for a while, you really need to be in the clinic. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1767.96s)]
*  That's the right time of development. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1773.88s)]
*  So it's not ideal to be an early pre-clinical stage company and listed. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1777.88s)]
*  So we were kind of grappling with how to square the circle where the investors we have are not [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1782.76s)]
*  really that interested in investing into this type of early stage technology or platform. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1789.24s)]
*  And then that's much more attractive to VCs, to come in early seed investors and VCs. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1793.4s)]
*  That's what we're really asking. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1799.48s)]
*  But they don't buy listed shares. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1800.6000000000001s)]
*  So from the get-go, when we set this up, we built it as a privately held subsidiary. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1805.0800000000002s)]
*  For a variety of reasons, we set that up in Sweden via a lab at the Karolinska Institute. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1812.2s)]
*  So we already from the start incorporated this as a standalone entity within the group. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1818.68s)]
*  It's still fully owned by the parent company. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1824.2s)]
*  And then you could view the listed parent company as the seed investor. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1826.68s)]
*  So the listed parent provided the funding to set the company up, generate that first data. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1831.6399999999999s)]
*  Because as you rightly point out, it's difficult to fundraise on a slide deck. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1837.48s)]
*  It was maybe too old, 2020, 2021. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1842.8400000000001s)]
*  It was. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1847.0s)]
*  Not so much now. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1848.28s)]
*  Now the reality is back. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1849.8000000000002s)]
*  You need to have a reasonable data package before you can do a solid financing. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1853.72s)]
*  So we've slowly built this from scratch. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1860.6000000000001s)]
*  And by doing it from the get-go, we have all the employees, the IP, the data, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1862.68s)]
*  everything is contained in this subsidiary in a different jurisdiction. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1865.96s)]
*  So I think we're building this as a private company, which we will eventually finance a spinout. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1870.28s)]
*  When the data package is mature enough, when the parent is no longer suitable or capable of [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1878.3600000000001s)]
*  funding it to its full potential, I think that's time to let that ship loose from the group. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1885.96s)]
*  And then the group holding company continues to run this KRAS cancer vaccine clinical development. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1893.56s)]
*  Did you turn to the West? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1902.44s)]
*  You mentioned that in Oslo and in Norway, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1904.52s)]
*  the appetite for investing in that early stage stuff is a little bit [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1907.88s)]
*  less than perhaps in Europe and the United States. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1912.2s)]
*  Did you sort of expand your horizons on that front as well? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1915.16s)]
*  Yeah, we've been doing extensive road shows and talking to investors. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1919.08s)]
*  I would say being a smaller Nordic biotech these days, it's easier to get traction with European VCs. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1923.0s)]
*  True. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1931.08s)]
*  I have a sense that there are basically fewer deals happening these days. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1932.52s)]
*  And many investors, I think, are overloaded with opportunities. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1938.52s)]
*  So I get this sense that the US VCs have more than enough with local opportunities. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1941.88s)]
*  It's more challenging to get the tension when you come from a small, weird country [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1949.0s)]
*  when there is plenty of US. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1957.24s)]
*  They don't even have time to review all the opportunities that are available. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1959.4s)]
*  It's certainly been trickier the last thing since the COVID bubble burst. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1963.72s)]
*  It's been harder for the Nordic or the European companies to get a lot of meetings and interest [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1968.8400000000001s)]
*  in the US. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1977.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it's zero, but it's less than it was before. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1977.64s)]
*  Whereas in Europe, I sense the opposite. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1980.84s)]
*  Now you tend to see higher valuations in the US. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1984.2s)]
*  I think many European VCs are to some degree preferring local investments because they see [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1987.24s)]
*  it as an opportunity to get better valuations. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=1994.76s)]
*  Are you finding... [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2000.36s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2001.72s)]
*  So all the investors we speak to, I'd say about 70%, 80% are European. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2002.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2007.96s)]
*  I'm curious, when you were starting to fundraise for Cirqueo, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2009.56s)]
*  have you seen that there's been shifts? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2015.56s)]
*  Sort of, obviously, there was a time when you could get as much money as you wanted [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2017.96s)]
*  with as little data as you had, right? [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2021.96s)]
*  And right now, you guys are in the process of getting as much data as you possibly can. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2025.0800000000002s)]
*  But are you finding that you're facing similar pushback from investors as you're striving [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2029.72s)]
*  to continue to raise more money? [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2034.6000000000001s)]
*  Where is some of that resistance, do you think, coming from? [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2037.8s)]
*  What are some of the biggest challenges you're facing in engaging the investor community today, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2040.76s)]
*  particularly as you're working with circular RNA and potential viral delivery, right? [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2045.8s)]
*  So I think circular RNA is definitely super hot at the moment. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2052.6s)]
*  It's as compared to when I've been trying to shop around the cancer vaccine and the [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2058.6s)]
*  non-covid virus, in fact, it is more difficult to... [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2063.0s)]
*  People don't automatically open their doors. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2065.64s)]
*  It's not something they have high on their shopping list. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2067.56s)]
*  You need to come with something extremely compelling. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2069.72s)]
*  When you come with a circular RNA program, everyone wants to listen. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2072.52s)]
*  This is just something everyone is really curious about these days. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2074.92s)]
*  I would say the biggest difference from a couple of years back to now, and challenge to some degree, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2078.92s)]
*  it's much harder to sell a platform now or to get investments into a platform. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2085.0s)]
*  And that's, in its essence, that what we're developing. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2091.0s)]
*  Our tool is circular RNA expression. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2094.04s)]
*  It's a genetic cassette that you could put anywhere. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2097.56s)]
*  It can be used to whatever you want to express from a DNA or a virus or even in a VLP context. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2100.44s)]
*  So it has a lot of versatility. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2108.68s)]
*  I don't think we've come to the point where we reached its maximum potential. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2110.52s)]
*  We still think it can get more potent than it is. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2116.44s)]
*  At the same time, we're still testing where does it work? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2120.04s)]
*  Which vectors are the best? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2125.2400000000002s)]
*  What tissues are the best? [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2126.52s)]
*  So this we still need to figure out. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2128.12s)]
*  But investors these days want a therapeutic candidate. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2131.32s)]
*  You need to have a lead program. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2135.88s)]
*  It's coming with a platform place. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2138.1200000000003s)]
*  It's difficult to get money in the back for. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2139.8s)]
*  So we need to have two thoughts in our head because it's crucial to keep expanding, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2143.6400000000003s)]
*  building, understanding, developing the platform. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2147.48s)]
*  But at the same time, having a therapeutic lead spare head, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2151.56s)]
*  which clearly says this is the direction we're going. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2156.44s)]
*  This is how we're going to get to a clinical proof of concept. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2159.4s)]
*  So what are you doing to try to confront that? [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2163.8s)]
*  The lack of interest in a platform company. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2166.6s)]
*  Have you had to change your strategy at all? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2171.64s)]
*  It's difficult because we came from cancer. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2175.4s)]
*  Now people tell us you need to go do... [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2177.16s)]
*  Several investors said when you're doing gene therapy, come back. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2179.24s)]
*  Okay, so we have to do gene therapy. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2181.56s)]
*  How can we deploy this technology in gene therapy? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2183.64s)]
*  Well, AAV is obvious because AAV has this caveat. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2187.24s)]
*  So I think it's the lowest technological risk. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2189.64s)]
*  It already works. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2193.0s)]
*  Clinically validated. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2194.12s)]
*  Manufacturing is understood. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2195.08s)]
*  It's approved for several and it has a lot of caveats. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2196.44s)]
*  So we can improve on this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2200.2799999999997s)]
*  So let's see if we can simply improve on existing AAV technology. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2202.2799999999997s)]
*  You take AAV, express a payload via a circle and use it on mRNA. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2208.7599999999998s)]
*  That's the only difference. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2212.12s)]
*  Everything else can be the same. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2213.08s)]
*  So you could then develop something, just go head to head with gas and existing gene therapy. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2214.92s)]
*  Take an AAV gene therapy and switch to our expression system, reduce the dose. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2220.04s)]
*  If you could do that, then show just in a non-inferiority trial. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2225.88s)]
*  I think that's something that could be approvable. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2229.0s)]
*  So this is where we started out. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2233.56s)]
*  Then the question is, what is the best disease to pick? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2235.2400000000002s)]
*  You either go that direction where you try and go head to head against something [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2240.92s)]
*  that's already existing and reduce the dose, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2245.4s)]
*  or do you pick something where AAVs weren't sufficiently effective in the past [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2248.36s)]
*  and then switching to a CERC RNA could get you over [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2254.76s)]
*  the threshold to make it clinically relevant? [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2257.96s)]
*  So that's something we debated back and forth. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2262.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think both options are still in play, but in the end we opted for the latter because [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2264.28s)]
*  once you start to go head to head against something else, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2269.88s)]
*  you need to do randomized trials and gene therapy is often diseases [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2272.52s)]
*  with very few patients available. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2275.88s)]
*  So we prefer to go to something that is still virgin territory. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2277.96s)]
*  So we decided, okay, let's pick a disease where AAVs have been tried, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2281.88s)]
*  but didn't make enough protein. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2285.6400000000003s)]
*  So we can boost the expression level and kind of have a successful therapeutic product that way. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2287.4s)]
*  And from there on, we were all oncologists, mainly. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2295.96s)]
*  The cancer is there, we knew, so we had to sit down and learn about genetic disease. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2299.0800000000004s)]
*  So we screened the genetic diseases you'd never heard of. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2304.68s)]
*  That's two great study parties. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2308.3599999999997s)]
*  We had a very talented analyst at the time. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2312.44s)]
*  It was excellent at compiling this information in true McKinsey style. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2314.68s)]
*  It's a perfect McKinsey project, right? [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2318.12s)]
*  Coming back to that. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2319.8799999999997s)]
*  Quickly sort of making five pages for each disease and have a good [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2321.3999999999996s)]
*  heat map where you can score what is the better and worse options. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2326.8399999999997s)]
*  And then in the end, we settled on a short list of disease targets [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2331.24s)]
*  all the while working on the platform in the background. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2336.12s)]
*  Matt and I are both jumping for the microphone. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2343.96s)]
*  We're arm wrestling. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2347.96s)]
*  I want to talk about the business. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2348.92s)]
*  I'm like, give me the science. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2351.8s)]
*  I will allow you to. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2355.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2357.72s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2358.68s)]
*  Host your podcast, Matt. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2359.64s)]
*  We've done a nice job of suffering the investor challenge perspective that Cirque face. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2364.6s)]
*  Now I'm curious about organizationally and particularly from a personnel level, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2371.08s)]
*  making this shift. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2376.52s)]
*  You mentioned this study party. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2378.52s)]
*  I envision all these oncologists, anyone who's watching the podcast right now on the website [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2380.44s)]
*  can see that Eric is in his summer home near a fjord in northern Norway. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2385.8s)]
*  The south coast of Norway, close to Christian Sand. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2393.4s)]
*  Like the southern tip of Norway. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2397.4s)]
*  I'm picturing him having all these oncologists gathering at the summer home in the fjord. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2399.7200000000003s)]
*  It's night though, and there's like candles everywhere. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2404.76s)]
*  Candles, yeah. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2407.32s)]
*  There's a lot of writing going on. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2408.44s)]
*  Live, maybe a giant PowerPoint. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2409.6400000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2411.48s)]
*  So there was that, right? [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2413.96s)]
*  Like you had to bring in that. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2415.32s)]
*  Painted the scene somewhat in a renaissance fashion. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2417.32s)]
*  The style of Tufinci. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2423.2400000000002s)]
*  You had to bring on all that scientific expertise. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2425.16s)]
*  And then as you formed up the organization, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2428.36s)]
*  what did you have to do from a personnel standpoint to support the development of the science? [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2431.08s)]
*  Yeah, this was really challenging because when I took over, the company was [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2436.92s)]
*  geared to run clinical trials. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2443.7200000000003s)]
*  It was being set up to enter later stage development. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2445.96s)]
*  So there was a relatively substantial CMC team [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2450.76s)]
*  and the clinical development and regulatory teams. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2454.52s)]
*  The bulk of the organization was CMC and clinical. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2456.76s)]
*  A lot of talented individuals. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2459.8s)]
*  We'd built a super team over the years. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2461.16s)]
*  And then we had very little science. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2464.44s)]
*  The labs had been shut down earlier because when you're in clinical development, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2468.7599999999998s)]
*  you have less need for that than the clinical data analysis was outsourced. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2473.72s)]
*  So we only had one or two scientists really. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2477.56s)]
*  And the CMC and clinical team, and obviously that's not what you need when you're building [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2480.92s)]
*  a preclinical research organization. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2487.08s)]
*  So very few- [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2489.48s)]
*  It's important though. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2490.6s)]
*  It is important. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2491.8799999999997s)]
*  We built down one part of the company and built up another part. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2494.6s)]
*  So the clinical development and CMC group is down to just one person in each. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2499.56s)]
*  That's it. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2507.56s)]
*  So that's been tough. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2507.96s)]
*  But everyone arrived, I have a very open dialogue and never [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2511.16s)]
*  hide anything and tell people the truth. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2517.72s)]
*  And I think people understood the rationale and this is what has to be done. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2519.48s)]
*  It's just the way things are. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2523.56s)]
*  So there's never been any grudges or it's sad, but that's just the way it is. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2525.08s)]
*  And then in parallel, we've built up a new science team in Stockholm. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2531.08s)]
*  So we've both been downsizing and recruiting at the same time. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2535.0s)]
*  Balancing the demand, right? [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2541.56s)]
*  We've added scientists and we have one more now. [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2544.04s)]
*  And actually an American lady coming in after summer joining us in Stockholm to manage a lab there. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2546.52s)]
*  We're just moving into a new lab and so that side is growing. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2552.44s)]
*  And in Oslo, we're down to it's just me and two finance people and myself. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2556.6s)]
*  So we're just three people left in Oslo managing the company. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2563.48s)]
*  So it becomes pretty complex and then the rest of the team is [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2567.64s)]
*  scattered with the bulk in Stockholm. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2571.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2574.44s)]
*  Circular RNA being buzzy as it is, at the same time, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2576.12s)]
*  it's a small probably but powerful group of companies that are working in development of this space right now. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2579.24s)]
*  Does that create competition for talent? [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2587.0s)]
*  Like is it tough to find people who can come in with their feet on the ground? [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2590.2s)]
*  I think everyone in my team has been approached by the other Circular RNA company. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2594.2799999999997s)]
*  It's a young field. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2602.7599999999998s)]
*  So we, and there was a lot of skepticism generally towards that original paper we published also. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2604.3599999999997s)]
*  It took a long time to get that published. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2610.68s)]
*  I think it's not until 2013, so about 10 years ago, where it became obvious to everyone that this is a real biologically relevant and functional class of non-coding RNA. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2612.52s)]
*  And from 2013 onwards, it's started growing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2623.8799999999997s)]
*  Initially, it was kind of an academic corner of people, a few people working on this, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2628.6800000000003s)]
*  until Alex Veseloff, out of the Dan Aderson lab, which became the foundation for RNA, [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2635.48s)]
*  showed that you could use it to express protein in mouse and then from there it kind of exploded a bit. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2640.36s)]
*  But the point I'm getting at is that it's only 10 years since it started and I think for the first five of those, very few people worked on it. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2645.4s)]
*  So it's extremely hard to find any experts. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2652.28s)]
*  There are very few scientists around who understand the biology of circular RNA and come with experience in the space. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2655.16s)]
*  So that's maybe what's holding back most the development. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2666.7599999999998s)]
*  We're still playing catch up in building the understanding and also learning the scientific techniques, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2670.36s)]
*  the manufacturing technology and having enough people who are knowledgeable about it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2681.4s)]
*  I'll ask a question that'll tee you up and get back into the science. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2687.2400000000002s)]
*  Because there's the historical biological foundation of information here that's hard to find. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  And then you winnow that down further when you talk about your differentiated approach to the space. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2699.1600000000003s)]
*  Obviously, even in a small but hot industry, there can't be three or four or five people doing the exact same thing. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2706.36s)]
*  So you winnow that down. Now you've got to take people who know what they're doing in general circular RNA and then you've got to teach the platform. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2716.36s)]
*  You've got to teach the differentiator. So let's talk about that a little bit and that'll tee you up, Anna Rose, to ask more questions about what Cirqueo is doing. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2724.28s)]
*  We'll find out. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2732.1200000000003s)]
*  Is it the in situ production approach at Cirqueo that is sort of the cornerstone of the differentiator there or is there more to that story? [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2732.9199999999996s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. So when we got into this, we see that all the other Cirque RNA companies are more or less doing the same thing. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2744.2s)]
*  It transcribed Cirque RNA as LMP packaged. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2752.2799999999997s)]
*  In many ways, repeating the BioNTech and Moderna play just using the circular format. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2755.48s)]
*  And once you figure out that manufacturing, it's a sensible thing to do because it's likely to be cheaper and better. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2762.2s)]
*  And I think that's what everyone jumped on first. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2767.88s)]
*  And still, when I talk to even people I've had two or three meetings with and explain our technology, they still think we do that. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2769.72s)]
*  I was just going to ask, is that confusing to people? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2775.72s)]
*  But remember, so first of all, we came from the virus angle. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2780.6s)]
*  We were a virus company. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2783.56s)]
*  And then secondly, we look at this space and we say, yeah, this obvious circular RNA is likely to outcompete mRNA. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2785.4s)]
*  mRNA has these chemical advantages, but these also apply in other contexts and they've so far been completely overlooked. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2790.7599999999998s)]
*  No one had just made that simple effort of making an expression system using Cirque RNA instead of mRNA from a vector. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2796.2799999999997s)]
*  And we saw it as an opportunity, a virgin territory in many ways. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2805.0s)]
*  So we're a small company. We're based in the Nordics. We're much less capitalized than these other companies. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2810.68s)]
*  Why go head to head against them when you can sort of have this niche that no one's taken and rather be the big player in another area of circular RNA? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2817.24s)]
*  So we don't view these other companies like Orna and Sale and then now Orbitol as well as editors. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2829.0s)]
*  This is complementary technology. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2839.64s)]
*  We are simply using circular RNA advantages for different purposes. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2842.68s)]
*  And I'm only aware of one or two other companies and groups really working on the same approach as we are doing. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2847.88s)]
*  I was going to say when I was first introduced to your company, my brain sort of exploded when I realized what you were doing. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2856.6s)]
*  Because again, I think in the RNA space, we're always talking about IVT. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2863.8s)]
*  And so to go to your site and to see the word circular RNA and also AAV, right, viral vectors, it gave pause. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2869.7200000000003s)]
*  I was like, what is this? How does this work? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2879.6400000000003s)]
*  So I think that it is a really interesting and a competitive angle. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2882.36s)]
*  But I also love this concept because I think in the RNA space in general, we're all talking about how we can create a pretty well-rounded toolbox. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2886.92s)]
*  It's not just one modality, one method of development. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2894.6s)]
*  I think having this version as well could be a really interesting addition to that. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2899.16s)]
*  We're bringing the advantages of circular into novel areas. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2904.12s)]
*  So a synthetic IVT, circular RNA, I don't think will ever be relevant in a gene therapy context because the durability isn't good enough. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2907.08s)]
*  This is something that's better than mRNA, but still it expresses for seven to ten days. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2914.7599999999998s)]
*  When you're talking gene therapy, you need something that can express a payload for years. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2920.04s)]
*  These months. So we're just solving different problems here. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2924.92s)]
*  And I think we are enabling circular RNA to be utilized for new things. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2929.7999999999997s)]
*  I was going to say one of the things too that I just kind of wanted to return to really quickly is one of the biggest challenges you'd mentioned is just that lack of sort of foundational research in this space because it is still so new. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2935.88s)]
*  I'm curious as you guys are working to sort of develop these products and position your science, [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2947.6400000000003s)]
*  where are some of the biggest groundbreaking foundational research elements to Cirq RNA that we need to see or that you're hoping to make as well to help, I'd say, kind of heighten the way that you're using circular RNA at Cirqio? [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2955.08s)]
*  I still think the delivery is what holds vector technology and delivery is what holds back the potential of a lot of therapeutic areas still. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2971.24s)]
*  So everyone wants to get to a point in the future where we have repeat dosable nucleic acid therapeutics that can traffic to the specific tissue or even cell type that you want it to. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=2988.36s)]
*  You give it IV, it goes where you want it to, it will express the gene there for a long period of time. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3006.28s)]
*  Only there, right? And only in that specific spot. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3012.76s)]
*  Exactly. And the underlying molecular biology exists, but the delivery doesn't exist yet. We simply don't have that kind of technology yet. I think you look into the future, we will get there. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3016.2s)]
*  But right now we're still dealing with relatively crude, like an LMP that you just rely on passive trafficking to the liver. So that means you can deliver stuff to the liver. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3030.6s)]
*  So obviously that's where you start. First, the therapies you pick diseases where like either muscle or liver, which you can easily access. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3041.1600000000003s)]
*  But the moment you start being able to get these into brain, art, other areas, you can start dealing with other diseases. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3048.04s)]
*  And inevitably, that's where we're going to get to in the future. But we can't solve everything. I think you need to focus right on what you're an expert in. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3060.04s)]
*  Some companies are vector companies. They make the best vectors like AAV engineering and having the AAV go where you want it to. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3068.04s)]
*  Others are delivery companies making chemical compositions that enable packaging and targeting of molecules and therapeutics that way. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3074.36s)]
*  And we are the sort of molecular biology. We create genetic constructs and we are relying on partnerships to solve these other challenges. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3085.0s)]
*  I was going to say, you know, you have been meeting with quite a few partners in the past year or two, right? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3098.2799999999997s)]
*  You've been you've been trying to shop your technology around and meet somebody who's complimentary. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3103.96s)]
*  So I'd be curious if you could share a bit more about how you're approaching partnerships today in the CERC RNA space, in that AAV realm. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3109.16s)]
*  What are some of the most important questions that you've been you've been asking your potential? [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3119.16s)]
*  Listen to you. Wasn't we last going to have a partnership? [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3123.4s)]
*  I know. Look at that. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3125.96s)]
*  Getting off the science of the time. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3127.2400000000002s)]
*  What I'm most excited about for the future is DNA based gene therapy. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3129.32s)]
*  So by that, I mean synthetic DNA format vectors that are redosable. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3137.8s)]
*  And I think that's where gene therapy will get to in the future. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3145.32s)]
*  We're going to probably move away from viruses because of more difficult to manufacture. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3150.6s)]
*  You get the immune response. You can't really redose them, at least not as it is now. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3157.4s)]
*  But if you could deliver a synthetic DNA construct efficiently, that should be much more durable than an RNA based therapeutic. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3162.6800000000003s)]
*  And also it should be redosable. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3172.28s)]
*  So that's sort of our long term goal to make DNA format gene therapies expressing the gene that we're delivering from our circular RNA CERCVEC technology. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3174.84s)]
*  So in terms of partnering, that's, of course, something we're very interested in meeting up and collaborating with DNA vector companies that have these technologies starting to develop. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3189.96s)]
*  None of these have moved into the clinic yet, so this is all kind of early stuff. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3204.52s)]
*  But that's a high focus for us in parallel with other delivery technologies like I described before. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3209.16s)]
*  And this is maybe more kind of a long term goal. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3217.8799999999997s)]
*  Of course, we need to keep in mind, like I said before, what's our lead therapeutic candidate. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3222.12s)]
*  And there we're still prioritizing AAV because it's something we believe that [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3228.2799999999997s)]
*  we can fix fast. It's much more straightforward and you don't need all these other moving parts to work together. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3232.7599999999998s)]
*  You can sort of make a simple switch to an AAV and have it work. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3239.72s)]
*  So there we're looking to partner with any AAV company. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3242.9199999999996s)]
*  Really, I think once we show this works and we can improve on the protein output from an AAV, every single AAV company should be interested in this technology. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3248.52s)]
*  Why would you want to make an AAV expressing for mRNA if you can do it via CirqueRNA and get more bang for your buck? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3258.44s)]
*  So there, I think we're trying to make ourselves attractive for AAV companies and we're looking for collaborations in that space and, of course, in parallel, advancing our own AAVs. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3265.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you have any, let me put the question this way, what can you share with us in terms of what a Cirqueo pipeline might look like? [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3279.08s)]
*  So the lead program we are working on right now is a disease called Alpha-1 Antipypsin Deficiency, AATD. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3293.48s)]
*  It's a disease that gives symptoms similar to COPD, breathing issues, and also it has a liver aspect to it. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3303.56s)]
*  And it's a unique genetic disease because you have a mutation and that mutation results in a misfolded protein. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3315.16s)]
*  And that misfolded protein, one, it accumulates in the liver, so over time you get liver toxicity and it can be very serious. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3326.2799999999997s)]
*  Patients need a transplant in the end. And then the lack of the functional protein causes these problems in the lung, like the COPD-like symptoms. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3333.56s)]
*  So it's a unique genetic disease where you need to deal with two problems. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3341.16s)]
*  You need to both remove the toxic form of the mutant protein and you need to replace the functional one. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3346.12s)]
*  Because we use circular RNA in our expression, we can do this trick where we're able to knock down in the patient the mutant form and replace from circular RNA the functional variant. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3353.32s)]
*  And it's only a single nucleotide difference between the two, so these are extremely similar. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3368.2000000000003s)]
*  But because we use a circular RNA for the replacement of the functional protein and naturally in the body there will be an mRNA making the mutant form in the patient, we can distinguish the two very cleanly, knock down one, replace the other. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3372.44s)]
*  So I think that's where we established a unique selling point, USP, and with our CIRCWIC we can do what we call remove and replace. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3390.28s)]
*  So we can have dual functional gene therapy where we shut something off at the same time as replacing the wild type. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3400.76s)]
*  And therefore we purposely looked for these type of diseases where you need to solve both of these problems. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3409.2400000000002s)]
*  And that would be really hard to do with any classic mainstream AV or gene therapy. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3414.6800000000003s)]
*  The only other technology that could deal with this in a similar way would be gene editing, which of course is exciting, but also very early. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3420.44s)]
*  So in that regard gene editing is our real competitor, not another circular RNA company. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3429.4s)]
*  Yeah, long story, but remove and replace gene therapy for AATD and beyond, that's where we're heading. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3434.28s)]
*  What does the landscape look like for other indications where remove and replace, where that approach would make sense? [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3443.4s)]
*  So when we started our screen for diseases, we thought actually there were many more, but most genetic diseases you usually have one problem or the other. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3450.84s)]
*  It's quite a few where you have this dual issue, but there are a couple where it's been changed. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3461.24s)]
*  Cystic fibrosis is another one where you both want to remove and replace at the same time. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3470.44s)]
*  And we're looking at several other candidates that we haven't disclosed yet. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3477.48s)]
*  Some day soon. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3485.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3486.7599999999998s)]
*  You don't necessarily need to, you could also use this knockdown capability to augment other pathways. [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3488.6s)]
*  So it doesn't necessarily have to be the exact, you're shutting down and replacing the scene. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3495.08s)]
*  You could pick other targets as well where you're able to here modulate pathways to boost the potency of your therapeutic. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3501.7200000000003s)]
*  We're running a little bit tight on time here, Adderose, but I don't want to cut you if you've got other burning questions regarding the RNA landscape from the science going on there. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3515.96s)]
*  Now's your chance. [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3525.16s)]
*  Oh man, that's a lot of pressure. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3526.28s)]
*  I'm sure you have more. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3528.76s)]
*  So much pressure. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3529.7200000000003s)]
*  Go ahead, Matt. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3530.92s)]
*  I'll cede the microphone this time. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3531.56s)]
*  This time, yeah. [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3534.28s)]
*  A rare occasion. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3535.56s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3538.2000000000003s)]
*  What's the next, I mean, you've mentioned there's a lot on the agenda, right? [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3538.84s)]
*  You've mentioned there's a lot going on there. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3542.76s)]
*  In terms of what Eric's going to do next, like what's the next immediate challenge that you as the leader of Cirqueo are compelled to wrestle to the ground? [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3546.84s)]
*  You can only pick one. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3556.44s)]
*  You can only pick one. [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3561.08s)]
*  You can only pick one. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3562.36s)]
*  Also, I think the challenge is to balance this need for having a lead, focusing on a lead candidate at the same time as expanding and building your platform. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3565.56s)]
*  We simply don't know yet. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3580.36s)]
*  When do we reach the maximum potential? [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3582.1200000000003s)]
*  Where does it work the best? [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3586.28s)]
*  And we may discover that our platform, it may have an even better application. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3588.52s)]
*  It may be more powerful here. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3594.84s)]
*  We should use it with this type of vector. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3596.1200000000003s)]
*  So I think it's important to balance here the platform versus the product candidate. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3598.76s)]
*  And like we pivoted before, I think we need to be ready to pivot in the future. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3606.44s)]
*  If we come across something that looks more promising, we need to be ready to switch because we still don't fully understand the potential and the best applications. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3610.12s)]
*  We have a pretty good idea, I would say. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3628.2s)]
*  We know which direction we're going in, but we're certainly not married to that and ready to switch when the time is... [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3630.04s)]
*  Or when the data calls for it. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3638.6s)]
*  It's a perfect, perfect set up, perfect segue for my last question for you. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3640.92s)]
*  I mean, as I said from the outset, if you're a biotech leader and you haven't pivoted yet, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3647.64s)]
*  there's going to come a point where on something you've got to make some important decisions that could fundamentally shift what you're currently working on. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3655.64s)]
*  So having lived through this and being that guy who does it optimistically and proactively embraces... [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3663.4s)]
*  And lives it too, right? [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3671.88s)]
*  To be honest, he's lived it professionally and personally. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3673.4s)]
*  For sure. [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3677.8s)]
*  Some people I think it's just inherent. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3680.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a natural embrace. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3683.48s)]
*  It feels good even. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3686.6s)]
*  For others, not so much. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3688.04s)]
*  What advice would you share to other biotech builders who maybe struggle with it or maybe haven't seen it yet? [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3689.8799999999997s)]
*  I think to some degree this is kind of a personality trait. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3697.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm also the type of person on a holiday, I like to change plans and go to a different location. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3701.0s)]
*  Let's do this instead. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3706.12s)]
*  I don't mind the change of plans or something unexpected happening I find energizing. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3708.2s)]
*  More being too focused for too long can get boring. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3716.2s)]
*  But some people are more like that and then maybe biotech is less an ideal organization or industry to be in. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3722.7599999999998s)]
*  I think you need to kind of love this fast-paced dynamic aspect, see new opportunities when stuff inevitably fails. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3734.8399999999997s)]
*  Other things work and unexpected things happen and you need to be able to quickly adapt to that. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3744.12s)]
*  And let it guide you and don't roll over and die. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3751.0s)]
*  Don't roll over and die. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3760.2799999999997s)]
*  That should be the subtitle for the... [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3762.2799999999997s)]
*  That's what you find a point on it. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3766.2799999999997s)]
*  It's what makes it fun. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3767.7999999999997s)]
*  But you can't be the nervous type clearly. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3771.2400000000002s)]
*  If you're after a little long-term predictability and stability then biotech is going to be a stressful arena for you. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3777.5600000000004s)]
*  Have you thought of photography or meal kit making? [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3788.36s)]
*  There are other options out there for you. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3794.2000000000003s)]
*  There were pivots there as well. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3796.52s)]

*  Hopefully we didn't do too much bouncing around, Anna Rose. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3808.2799999999997s)]
*  I think we restrained ourselves. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3811.08s)]
*  There's so much more we could talk about but we'll let you off the hook for now. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iso51hpRf7c&t=3815.3199999999997s)]
