# CDMO + Emerging Bio Partnership With Forge's John Maslowski And Ray's Jenny Holt
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0)
*  Hey, business biotechers. This is Matt Piller. And before we jump into today's episode, I have a big special announcement. On Monday, November 13th at 11 a.m. Eastern, we're taking the business of biotech live for a one hour, highly interactive web conversation with a special guest you won't want to miss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm planning a good 30 minute grilling of BlueSphere Bio CEO and biotech legal expert, Kier Loyacono, on legal and IP protection considerations for new and emerging biotechs. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=18.08s)]
*  Kier is an Esquire and a veteran biotech attorney turned CEO with a ton of experience. And when I'm done with him, I'll turn him over to a select group of viewers, you business biotechers who will have the benefit of 30 minutes of face to face Q&A and interaction with Kier and other members of the call. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=31.08s)]
*  This hour will be incredibly consultative and offer great value at no cost but your time. And it's an opportunity for some face to face virtual networking with fellow business of biotech listeners who just so happen to be the coolest cats in the business. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=51.08s)]
*  Go to the link in the show notes of today's episode to register, and I'll see you there. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=68.08s)]
*  Back in October 2021 on episode 65, we enjoyed a conversation with Forge Biologist co-founder, president and CEO Tim Miller. That conversation focused on the growing biotech's effort to balance demand for its CDMO services with development of its own internal pipeline of candidates for infantile crab and rare monogenic diseases. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=77.08s)]
*  Since then, the company CDMO services business has exploded to the point that it's now a global leader in outsourced gene therapy manufacturing. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=101.08s)]
*  One of its clients, a biotech called Ray Therapeutics that's developing optogenetic therapies for a range of degenerative retinal diseases, was also featured on this podcast when Ray co-founder and CEO Paul Bresge joined me last October on episode 119. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=110.08s)]
*  This episode is special because we're bringing Ray Therapeutics and Forge Biologics back this time together for an introspective dive into the genesis and continuity of the sponsor outsourcer relationship. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=128.08s)]
*  I think it'll prove educational for any biotech seeking to create outsourcing success from the outset. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=143.08s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. This is the business of biotech and joining me from San Francisco is Jenny Holt, chief development officer at Ray Therapeutics. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=150.08s)]
*  And from right down the road, so to speak, maybe the other corner of the state in Philly is John Maslowski, chief commercial officer at Forge Biologics. Jenny and John, welcome to the show. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=160.08s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. It's great to be here. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=171.08s)]
*  Yeah, Matt. Thanks for having us. We appreciate it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=173.08s)]
*  It's great to have you both. I'm really looking forward to this conversation. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=175.08s)]
*  John, let me I said the opposite corner of the state. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=178.08s)]
*  I'm up in Erie, but you just told me moments ago that you moved. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=182.08s)]
*  Are you still in Philly? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=185.08s)]
*  I am just another area outside the suburbs of Philly. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=187.08s)]
*  So but still here, still an Eagles fan, so can't leave the area. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=190.08s)]
*  All right. Well, I grew up in Buffalo. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=194.08s)]
*  I'm a Bills fan. So, you know, sounds good. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=196.08s)]
*  Yeah. You know, I had just sounds good. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=200.08s)]
*  Believe it or not. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=204.08s)]
*  Now, they're going to have a great year. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=206.08s)]
*  Yeah. John, I had like I said, I had to Miller on the on the show way back in the early days, Episode 65. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=208.08s)]
*  That was early days for the podcast. And I really enjoyed the conversation with him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=217.08s)]
*  The company has grown so explosively since then. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=221.08s)]
*  He's a fantastic leader. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=225.08s)]
*  And I'm thrilled to have Forge back on. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=227.08s)]
*  We typically don't have outsourced partners. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=230.08s)]
*  You know, you're sort of a member of the supplier vendor community. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=232.08s)]
*  Right. We focus on biotech execs. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=235.08s)]
*  So one feel privileged, feel honored that I'm having you on the course. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=238.08s)]
*  Of course. Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=243.08s)]
*  I'm curious if you could just share a little bit about, you know, what you do for Tim and Forge and a little bit on your background so we can set up the gist of the con. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=245.08s)]
*  Sure. Sure. It's interesting. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=254.08s)]
*  Tim and I go back a ways. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=256.08s)]
*  We were both CEOs of company working actually in the same disease space and after my sis below. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=257.08s)]
*  So he was that ad, you know, the therapy, it's myself, CEO of Fibercell Science here in the Philadelphia region. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=263.08s)]
*  And, you know, but was able to develop a mutual respect and also a drive to create multiple options for patients. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=268.08s)]
*  So we thought best to have all these drugs on the market so they can all access them and treat their care as much as they need to that. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=275.08s)]
*  That mutual admiration turned into an opportunity to work together. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=283.08s)]
*  And, you know, I being in the selling gene space for about 18 years now, I go quite a ways back and most on the board of the Alliance Regenerative Medicine as well. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=288.08s)]
*  We track and really and really advocate for the space globally. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=297.08s)]
*  Manufacturing, of course, will continue to be one of the sort of ongoing needs that will continue to grow and evolve. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=302.08s)]
*  And with such complex processes, you know, having experts centralized in a way that can help growing biotechs actually advance their programs really is a benefit. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=308.08s)]
*  So to me, you know, I'm being asked to come in and run what is essentially the commercial wall of running not only sales and marketing more in the classical sense, but also the client relationships. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=318.08s)]
*  So our client resource group will actually work directly with groups like Right Therapeutics and help them, you know, not only keep them up to date in advances of their program, but also answer questions, interact, work very collaboratively together. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=328.08s)]
*  You know, that also falls within our commercial group as well. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=344.08s)]
*  So I had the lucky benefit of not only being part of Forge, but also getting to touch on all these wonderful advanced therapeutics that are coming through our shop and seeing them come to fruition. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=347.08s)]
*  So, yeah, very nice. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=357.08s)]
*  We're going to I think we'll have a nice illustration of that role as we discuss what you're doing for for and with Ray with Jenny. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=359.08s)]
*  But Jenny, as I mentioned, I had Paul on the show, I don't know, 119, I think I said it was. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=367.08s)]
*  I had him and Dima Kuzmin, who's a managing partner for one of your lead investors. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=376.08s)]
*  That episode is one of my all time favorites for a couple of reasons. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=381.08s)]
*  One, because Paul is just an amazing man, like an amazing man with a super inspiring story. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=385.08s)]
*  And I just really, really appreciated his transparency. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=390.08s)]
*  But also selfishly, because that episode lit up the scoreboard, man, like that that episode has done so, so well for us. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=394.08s)]
*  It really resonated. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=401.08s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons I'm excited about this episode, because it's going to follow a similar format. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=403.08s)]
*  We, you know, in that episode, we had we had we had Paul and Dima on talking about their relationship, you know, sort of that ecosystem of of biopharma and investor. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=407.08s)]
*  And here we're kind of having the same format in the discussion around biopharma and outsourcer. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=419.08s)]
*  So Ray's a great company. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=424.08s)]
*  Paul made that very clear. Super exciting place to be. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=428.08s)]
*  How did you end up there and what do you do in there? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=430.08s)]
*  Right. Good question. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=433.08s)]
*  I was fortunate enough to be introduced to Paul Bresge a few years ago. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=435.08s)]
*  We have a good year or two before you've been joined. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=441.08s)]
*  I was aware of what he had been working on prior to Ray. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=444.08s)]
*  And then I met him as Ray Therapeutics was just getting going. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=448.08s)]
*  In my background, I have over 25 years in gene therapy and you worked everything from biotech to big pharma. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=453.08s)]
*  I worked as a scientist for a good chunk of my career. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=462.08s)]
*  And then I went into the management side, program management, alliance management, and I'd worked at a few startups. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=466.08s)]
*  So I became aware that Paul needed a project manager. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=473.08s)]
*  You know, we do have a grant with CIRM and that is a requirement. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=480.08s)]
*  And we were great relationship with CIRM and we and he suddenly he needed somebody. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=484.08s)]
*  And it was a good time for me. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=489.08s)]
*  I was at Forty Molecular Therapeutics, another AAB gene therapy based company, phenomenal company. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=492.08s)]
*  I love my time there. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=498.08s)]
*  But I do love that startup environment. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=500.08s)]
*  And Paul is so inspiring that I thought, you know, I think I can really help here and really help get this company off the ground and working with Paul. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=503.08s)]
*  And I became soon after the chief development officer. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=511.08s)]
*  It's more recent. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  And after going through a series A Ray, series A after going through a series A raise, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=517.0799999999999s)]
*  And we're fortunate enough to raise one hundred million dollars. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=524.08s)]
*  I became chief development officer. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=527.08s)]
*  And so now I work closely with Paul and our chief scientific chief medical officer, Peter Francis. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=529.08s)]
*  And of course, the entire team just to help monitor everything that goes on at the company. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=535.08s)]
*  Yeah, activities, anything and everything. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=542.08s)]
*  So I'm really enjoying it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=546.08s)]
*  And Paul is inspiring and his story and the patient perspective is on our minds every day. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=548.08s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=556.08s)]
*  I guess I believe every word of that. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=557.08s)]
*  And let that be a warning to chief development officers and small biotechs. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=561.08s)]
*  You're going to wear a lot of hats, right? [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=566.08s)]
*  Overseeing. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=568.08s)]
*  Jenny says everything. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=569.08s)]
*  Jenny, when you joined, how long has it been? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=571.08s)]
*  How long did you say you've been there? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=574.08s)]
*  About a year and a half. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=576.08s)]
*  Year and a half. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=577.08s)]
*  So when you joined a year and a half ago, was the relationship with Forge as an outsourcing partner already established? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=578.08s)]
*  It was already established. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=585.08s)]
*  And I am happily I was very happy to learn about how they met, what work was planned, what was already done and stepped in and really become the the managing person on behalf of Ray working with Forge. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=587.08s)]
*  So yes, it was already established. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=605.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=607.08s)]
*  John, with a big thumbs up. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=608.08s)]
*  That's good. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=611.08s)]
*  You guys don't have to cheerlead for one another so blatantly here. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=612.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=616.08s)]
*  John, were you were you with Forge when the relationship was established? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=617.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=622.08s)]
*  I was there about about about two and a half years now after my after the sale of my last business and was here for the start of the Ray deal. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=624.08s)]
*  And, you know, it's, you know, it's through a series of introductions through consultants, but also conferences. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=634.08s)]
*  You know, we luckily we have the opportunity to market widely and use a lot of our mechanisms, including Marina, who you've met earlier and the rest of my marketing group to really get to meet these these qualified leads. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=641.08s)]
*  And Ray was one that's come through with a lot of wonderful feedback about their technology, about their target audience for patients. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=653.08s)]
*  And so for us, you know, it was a wonderful, intriguing project to hope to take on. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=661.08s)]
*  So tell me about the courtship. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=666.08s)]
*  Were you courting Ray or did Ray come looking looking to you? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=669.08s)]
*  Oh, I think that those things tend to be a bit mutual. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=673.08s)]
*  You know, we of course, as a provider, you know, you talk to mostly to development companies, you know, our goal is to show that we have the right stuff, right? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=676.08s)]
*  We want to make sure they know that they don't come to a CDMO and bring their projects and sort of hope we know what we're doing. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=686.08s)]
*  Right. And I've in my past being on the development side, I've luckily got to be on both sides on the fence. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=692.08s)]
*  Know that when you go to a CDMO and you end up teaching that CDMO more than you're actually getting service from, it's a very frustrating place to be in a group. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=698.08s)]
*  Who really needs, you know, time on their side. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=705.08s)]
*  You know, they have cash for and they've got a board and they also have patients who are very, you know, have been waiting a long time for relief. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=707.08s)]
*  And and so with that in hand, you want to make sure you're working with the right people and that you also have a platform to get you there quickly. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=714.08s)]
*  So we endeavor to show that not only just meet the commercial team, but meet Dr. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=720.08s)]
*  David Dizzy, our chief, our chief scientific officer, our chief technical officer, and the rest of our team will actually be the technical team. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=726.08s)]
*  We'll actually be the technical leads working in our true AV experts in their field. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=734.08s)]
*  I think that, you know, that to us is how we would try to go to Ray and say, you know, hey, you know, look what we have come see our facility, make sure you're comfortable and and that you trust us as a partner. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=739.08s)]
*  So, Jenny, you said that when you joined you when you when you joined Ray, the relationship had already been established, but you you gave it a thumbs up. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=750.08s)]
*  You were approving of the of the already established relationship. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=760.08s)]
*  Why? Well, one of the first things I asked is like, well, how did how did we choose for what do you know, what am I adopting here? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=763.08s)]
*  And Paul, one of the first things he did at the start of Ray was have the project of choosing a CDMO. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=771.08s)]
*  And they Ray Therapeutics, they hired a consultant and did a very rigorous landscape analysis, looked at a number of CDMOs to determine who is the right fit for us. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=780.08s)]
*  And as John said, who had the right stuff? And and that became Forge. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=790.08s)]
*  And so that was, you know, learning that, you know, put me at ease. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=796.08s)]
*  And as also John mentioned, the technical expertise was a was a big one. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=800.08s)]
*  David Dismukes, not only AAD experience, but he actually has some background in optogenetics and we're an optogenetics company. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=806.08s)]
*  Yeah, I was going to I was going to ask that like the optogenetic, you know, you're like the right stuff. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=815.08s)]
*  You know, John, John, that's a it's a it's a it's a catchy thing to say. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=820.08s)]
*  That stuff, the right stuff is a lot different to a lot of different people. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=824.08s)]
*  Right. That's exactly right. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=827.08s)]
*  And Ray's therapeutic approach is complex and it's it's niche, right? Optogenetics is a niche space. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=829.08s)]
*  So so, Jenny, like you said, there was there was a guy there that had some optogenetics experience. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=837.08s)]
*  Yes. And obviously, good AAD expertise, David Dismukes. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=842.08s)]
*  And, you know, and we also found that the Forge team is a lot of technical expertise. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=847.08s)]
*  You know, we were at that point, especially a very small company, and we needed a CDMO that could provide more technical expertise than just as John mentioned, us as doing it for CDMO. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=853.08s)]
*  We wanted this to be a partnership, not just, hey, make this for us. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=866.08s)]
*  We wanted more of that collaborative partnership style, not just a provider. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=870.08s)]
*  And that was also what we established with Forge. And that was important to us as well. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=875.08s)]
*  Yeah. Not not that I expect you to name names, Jenny. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=879.08s)]
*  I wouldn't ask you to do that. I don't want to push you outside of the comfort zone, obviously. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=884.08s)]
*  But do you have any sense of like what that the consultation engagement that led you to to Forge as a candidate and sort of the. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=888.08s)]
*  I don't know. I guess sort of the criteria that knocked some of the other folks out, maybe. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=900.08s)]
*  There's some color on that. Yeah, absolutely. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=906.08s)]
*  You know, the number of CDM and CDM has looked at and not only technical expertise. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=909.08s)]
*  Obviously, you have to have a fit with your timeline, the scale that you need and project costs. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=916.08s)]
*  It has to be a fit into where we were and are. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=924.08s)]
*  And, you know, and also, you know, looking at Forge, they were very important. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=927.08s)]
*  And that's important. There's a low turnover rate there. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=932.08s)]
*  So who we work with, we still work with. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=935.08s)]
*  This is a well-established company that with, you know, with solid technical expertise and the people stayed and the company had good funding. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=938.08s)]
*  There's also a lot of new CDMOS popping up that don't make it. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=947.08s)]
*  And then that's a risk for your project. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=951.08s)]
*  Forge had good funding and was established. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=955.08s)]
*  And so just it just kept checking off all the boxes as we were comparing them to others. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=957.08s)]
*  I find it really like it boggles my mind to hear you say that there are like a lot of new CDMOS popping up who don't make it when like I mean, the first part doesn't boggle my mind at all. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=963.08s)]
*  Like these press releases cross my desk at a rapid clip like the cadence of, you know, new CDMO facilities. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=976.08s)]
*  It's mind boggling and the money going into them. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=983.08s)]
*  But I also this is the space I cover emerging biopharma. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=986.08s)]
*  And, you know, I interview hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of execs of emerging biopharmaceutical companies who outsource their development and manufacturing. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=990.08s)]
*  I mean, how can you not make it in this space? [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=999.08s)]
*  Forge, when I talked to Forge a couple of years ago, they were already big and growing. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1002.08s)]
*  I mean, you know, the success has been has been rabid. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1005.08s)]
*  There's just like, how do you how do you not make it? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1008.08s)]
*  Like, I don't know. I don't know if I'm asking you that question like rhetorically. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1011.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1016.08s)]
*  And sometimes it's an important question too, because there's clearly a gap. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1017.08s)]
*  I think we did an analysis. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1023.08s)]
*  We looked at like, what's the total available by reactor size that we know of publicly that's in the world or at least in the U.S. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1025.08s)]
*  too. And what's already what's the need? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1032.08s)]
*  Like, look at and you'll get need like let's look at the volume of clinical trials and selling gene therapy. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1035.08s)]
*  ARM reports on them every year. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1040.08s)]
*  They're growing the year over year was 11 percent, you know, that was reported previously. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1042.08s)]
*  And I've seen numbers ranging, you know, you know, quite a bit between that growth. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1048.08s)]
*  And then the turnover for commercialization. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1053.08s)]
*  So, you know, luckily, we are continuing to see the agency approving more selling gene therapy products and that reimbursement is, you know, is occurring, you know, and getting through payers. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1056.08s)]
*  So as this sort of, you know, acceptance grows, so does the manufacturing department. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1069.08s)]
*  So to your point, it sounds like every leader, every cell stack, every cell factor, everything should count. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1075.08s)]
*  But then it comes back to I think what, you know, Jenny and I were sort of talking about is, you know, is the right team in place? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1082.08s)]
*  Do they have the expertise to actually carry them along? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1088.08s)]
*  I'll give you, for instance, like we have we have our own regulatory support as well. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1091.08s)]
*  Some clients, you know, when they're very small, you know, struggle to navigate the same CPL with the agency. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1096.08s)]
*  It's sort of, you know, it's ever changing. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1102.08s)]
*  So our head of regulatory Chris Schilling was nationwide for, you know, for many years and so dozens of INDs, including those who recently approved drugs. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1104.08s)]
*  So that expertise, I think, is what will centralize a lot of the companies to come towards and maybe consolidate some of that manufacturing. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1114.08s)]
*  But it's difficult to get that team together and be properly funded because it is a lot of capital, right, to build a facility and build the infrastructure and do it correctly and qualify the company. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1123.08s)]
*  I think a lot of people forget about qualification validation. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1133.08s)]
*  That's a that's a that's a big lift. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1136.08s)]
*  And I think that's where some of the differentiation occurs when you're selecting. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1138.08s)]
*  So, yeah, Jenny, I want to ask you a follow up on something that you mentioned just a couple of minutes ago. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1142.08s)]
*  You know, among the boxes that that you mentioned that Ray was looking to check were timeline, scallop and costs and those three things. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1149.08s)]
*  You know, I hear from my vantage point, spending a lot of time talking with the leaders of emerging biopharma companies, you know. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1160.08s)]
*  Well, I should say when when everyone was flush with cash, you know, pre-COVID coming into COVID, like when COVID was just money everywhere, cost. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1167.08s)]
*  I mean, yeah, it was expensive and people talked about the expense, but it was sort of not as big a factor as timelines. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1176.08s)]
*  And then I would say scallop might have been a close second, right. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1185.08s)]
*  The ability to scale. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1188.08s)]
*  Give me a I guess just give me some color on what you're seeing now, Jenny, from like what you're seeing in terms of timelines and what you're what a company like raise expectations are. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1190.08s)]
*  You know, I liken it to this is a very bad. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1203.08s)]
*  My wife tells me I'm terrible at analogies all the time, so I'm going to put that on full display right now. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1206.08s)]
*  It's kind of like a it's like an outsource. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1210.08s)]
*  A CDMO is like a mom or a dad who has, you know, 47 children. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1213.08s)]
*  And they're all clamoring for that same amount of, you know, for a finite amount of time, a finite amount of like resource of attention. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1221.08s)]
*  And, you know, that that if if if if dad doesn't have a partner or whatever, like it's you know, it's tough, right? [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1231.08s)]
*  Like it's it's tough. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1238.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah, I proved it. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1240.08s)]
*  It's a bad analogy. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1242.08s)]
*  You know what you get my point though. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1244.08s)]
*  I think we know what you meant though. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1246.08s)]
*  So that's a good point. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1248.08s)]
*  You get my point. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1249.08s)]
*  Yeah, like what's a what's a what's acceptable? [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1250.08s)]
*  Like what's acceptable? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1252.08s)]
*  You don't have to give me specific numbers, but like how do you how do you kind of suss that out knowing that everyone's struggling for for the money? [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1253.08s)]
*  I mean, I think we're struggling for attention from the outsourcing community right now. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1260.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1264.08s)]
*  If I if I understand the analogy in the question correctly, good luck, maybe I'll just come up with something totally off the wall. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1265.08s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1274.08s)]
*  But you have a big background in program management and there's always that I think they call it the golden triangle where you balance quality time and cost. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1275.08s)]
*  You have to decide what are you giving on what's flexed if one side of the triangle changes, so do the others. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1284.08s)]
*  So it's a constant balance and we have to decide what's most important to us. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1291.08s)]
*  Now, obviously, GMP manufacturing going to the clinic quality is not something you can corners. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1296.08s)]
*  This is going, you know, going to treat patients. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1303.08s)]
*  So then you're balancing. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1306.08s)]
*  OK, you know, timeline budget. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1307.08s)]
*  So we have worked really closely with four, like, you know, telling them, you know, our goals to get to clinic and, you know, and work with them and how to reach those goals and always balancing budget. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1309.08s)]
*  You know, but if we if we have changed the budget here and there as we go in order to hit all the other goals. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1322.08s)]
*  And but working together as a team to have those discussions and make sure we keep that that quality in mind as well as an appropriate timeline for Ray Therapeutics of the company. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1330.08s)]
*  It's a constant balance and a constant conversation, actually. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1342.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1346.08s)]
*  I've got a question for you on that constant conversation and sort of how that plays out in real time. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1348.08s)]
*  But one more quick follow up before we get to that one. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1352.08s)]
*  I was in Boston a couple of weeks ago for it was during a biotech week in Boston. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1355.08s)]
*  I went out there and recorded some podcasts with with a few execs at their HQ's and in a couple of those conversations, we were talking about how like the the BPI show was going on. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1360.08s)]
*  You know, it's like a it's like a I'm not sure if Forge was there or not. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1371.08s)]
*  I'm not sure if I saw Forge there or not. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1374.08s)]
*  We had some of our team there. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1376.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'm sure. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1377.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1378.08s)]
*  I mean, among other CDMOs and obviously it's a it's a tech, tech centric sort of vendor driven supplier, supplier side show. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1379.08s)]
*  But we were talking I talked with a couple of these execs about like the the difference in in the difference like the change from and get like sales engagement with an outsourcing BD business development rep through contracting to execution like [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1388.08s)]
*  where during that process, like things can things can often go like, you know, here's where we are. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1407.08s)]
*  Here's where we were during the sales process. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1415.08s)]
*  Here's where we are now. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1417.08s)]
*  And it doesn't align like it's not you know, what what was promised isn't necessarily there. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1418.08s)]
*  Now, Jenny, I know you weren't there probably during the contracting phase. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1423.08s)]
*  But so, John, I'll let you kind of comment on that. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1428.08s)]
*  Like in your experience, having worked on the other side as well, right. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1431.08s)]
*  Having worked as a biopharma exec. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1434.08s)]
*  What are some what are some common areas of failure between the pitch, the contract and the in the beginning of the execution of the relationship? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1438.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think to your point, Matt, this is something I forge. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1447.08s)]
*  We were very careful with because I very well said that in my past experiences that continuity sometimes is is is a big thing complete. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1450.08s)]
*  It's it's sort of what you were promised versus what you're supposed to sign against. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1461.08s)]
*  And really, what do they look like? [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1465.08s)]
*  And we did it a little differently, a forge in our past of our experiences where a couple of things, the same people are tend to be involved the entire process. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1467.08s)]
*  I've had experiences where you talk to a, you know, client development rep and then you're moved to legal and then you're moved to contracting. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1477.08s)]
*  And now you're on your sixth or seventh contact and it's whispered down the lane. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1484.08s)]
*  You know, all your terms are starting to get a little muddy. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1488.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1490.08s)]
*  So what we purposely do it for is we've established a couple of sub teams that all work with that client through the entire process. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1491.08s)]
*  It's generally a client development representative, which is, you know, the sort of the folks who are out there making the relationships and and spreading the sort of Ford story. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1497.08s)]
*  But we also carry a technical sales group. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1508.08s)]
*  And why we do that, these are, you know, AV scientists who work exclusively on the sales side to act as almost like, you know, an MSL. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1510.08s)]
*  If you're talking about in the classical pharmaceutical drug sales turn to help partner with that, you know, client development rep and, you know, explain the technical parts of the process. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1518.08s)]
*  We're not pulling all of our process development people off the floor every day. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1528.08s)]
*  They're actually scientists who are trained in that area and can move ahead and then it moves into client relations who are also involved early. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1532.08s)]
*  So that whole process is seamless in that, you know, it's the same team we're keeping in contact. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1540.08s)]
*  So there's a clear understanding of transparency with the client. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1546.08s)]
*  We also provide technical questionnaires and meetings. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1549.08s)]
*  So we make sure we're actually creating the right program. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1552.08s)]
*  You know, what is your stereotype? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1555.08s)]
*  What sort of composite is it? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1557.08s)]
*  Is it single stranded or self comp? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1558.08s)]
*  You know, what's your, you know, what's your target tighter goals? [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1560.08s)]
*  You know, what's your route of administration even just because we want to make sure we're fashioning the right product profile for that particular program. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1564.08s)]
*  I think if that's done piecemeal along the way, you lose that traction and at the end you end up sort of different street from where you started your journey. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1571.08s)]
*  So, you know, one of the goals we have is let's eliminate a lot of that noise and try to keep it seamless with the same group. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1579.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1585.08s)]
*  God, your analogies are better than mine. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1586.08s)]
*  They're tight and they're concise. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1588.08s)]
*  Yeah, I appreciate that. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1591.08s)]
*  It's a hobby of mine. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1592.08s)]
*  So I appreciate that. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1593.08s)]
*  I need to polish that hobby up a little bit. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1595.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1600.08s)]
*  So the day sort of that I want to get into some conversation around sort of the daily and common nurturing and maintenance of execution. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1601.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1609.08s)]
*  So maybe let's make that give some personal perspective on that. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1611.08s)]
*  John, when did you meet? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1616.08s)]
*  Well, first, let me ask you this. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1619.08s)]
*  Are you two like, are you, John, are you the primary caregiver to the Ray relationship? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1620.08s)]
*  Yeah, it's so my team I have really will spend their day to day, you know, and and weeks to weeks with with Jenny and her team. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1627.08s)]
*  So my I like I sort of alluded to before we have a client relations team. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1636.08s)]
*  Now, I think this is an important point and maybe good advice to other CDMOs. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1640.08s)]
*  And I know a bunch who do this as well, but I see it missing sometimes where there's not sort of that, you know, that concierge approach of this is the person to come to who will coordinate and be your internal advocate and forge. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1645.08s)]
*  You know, and that's what this client relations group's job is to do is to make sure if Jenny needs something, they get on the phone right away. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1658.08s)]
*  They make sure that we pull the right team together. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1665.08s)]
*  We're answering questions. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1667.08s)]
*  We're working through a scientific sort of sort of puzzle together. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1668.08s)]
*  And, you know, we make sure that advances properly. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1672.08s)]
*  So so that is I think that approach is very important, you know, to keep keep keep a sort of transparent, honest relationship through the process. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1675.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1684.08s)]
*  And Jenny, you are the the overseer and sort of the day to day leader of the of the relationship from the from the Ray side. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1685.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1693.08s)]
*  And we recently brought on a vice president of CMC, Jared Denim. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1694.08s)]
*  So the team on the race side is growing, but I am on every interaction with Forge and including the weekly calls that with the client relations manager and team, technical team, project manager. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1699.08s)]
*  And I guess so that's we. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1714.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1717.08s)]
*  And that's where I was going to go. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1718.08s)]
*  Go next. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1719.08s)]
*  When did you two first interact with one another? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1720.08s)]
*  When did you meet? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1723.08s)]
*  Oh, when Jenny joined. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1724.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1726.08s)]
*  So maybe. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1727.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1729.08s)]
*  And that maybe, you know, to sort of add to the story of our interactions, because, you know, I think you're going down the right line of questioning is really what is that sort of relationship? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1730.08s)]
*  And although their routine, you know, sort of discussions occur at, you know, on a daily level, there's also access to Tim and I and to David. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1739.08s)]
*  We're on a lot of these calls as well. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1748.08s)]
*  And that's also important, too, because we need to, you know, we want to make sure that, you know, Jenny and and Paul and everybody on the team and Peter really are heard and that they're making sure they're having their right sort of, you know, questions answered. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1750.08s)]
*  But not only that, that we're meeting their sort of time and needs, because we've all been on that other side of, you know, you know, there's a study starting. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1764.08s)]
*  We have to make sure you have delivery. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1771.08s)]
*  And so I think it's important for groups to not get overly regimented about here's your manager. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1773.08s)]
*  Good luck. You know, it's really you really do need a broader personalized relationship. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1779.08s)]
*  We tried to do that. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1784.08s)]
*  So Jen and I met when she joined and we've seen each other at conferences playing just at HGCT recently. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1785.08s)]
*  And I don't know, Jenny, if you'll be at the MED meeting or the Mesa meeting next week, but we'll both be there and catch up there as well. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1791.08s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1798.08s)]
*  This podcast will air after the meeting on the Mesa, just for reference, just as our audience is aware. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1799.08s)]
*  Like if you're planning on going to the meeting, you're listening to this right now and you're planning on going to the meeting on the Mesa, you're going to need to do that in 2024. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1808.08s)]
*  Just keep things clear. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1814.08s)]
*  Or I hope it's a great week. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1816.08s)]
*  I don't know if you caught it, but John just affirmed that I'm going down the right line of questioning, which is very important to me given that this is my podcast. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1817.08s)]
*  Of course, I'm going down the right line. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1825.08s)]
*  I go down any line of questioning I want. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1827.08s)]
*  Sometimes it's a completely errant line. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1829.08s)]
*  But tell me about those weekly meetings. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1832.08s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1836.08s)]
*  Like what are you doing in those meetings? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1838.08s)]
*  Jenny, what do you need to come away from those meetings with? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1839.08s)]
*  Variety of things. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1844.08s)]
*  Yeah, so they're weekly and it's with the client relations manager, project manager, and the technical team. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1846.08s)]
*  We usually establish an agenda in advance. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1852.08s)]
*  You know, what are the important topics to hit? [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1854.08s)]
*  Sometimes it is, I want to go over the contract again or I want to, our timelines are down to, we want to go over this technical step. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1856.08s)]
*  We want to, you know, and it's usually an update on status. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1865.08s)]
*  It's a very mutual building of the agenda and a lot of back and forth from both from both of us. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1869.08s)]
*  And so that's weekly and it keeps us up to speed. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1876.08s)]
*  And then, you know, as needed, there's ad hoc follow up if we don't, if we're out of time or have more questions or obviously email follow up. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1880.08s)]
*  So I feel like the team is accessible to me anytime it's needed. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1888.08s)]
*  Even sometimes I'm like, I can't remember what it, what did we talk about with this? [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1894.08s)]
*  And then I'll just email that I'm so sorry. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1898.08s)]
*  I can't find my note. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1900.08s)]
*  Can you remind me of what, you know, and they get right back to me within, you know, within a business day, which is pretty rare for CDMO, you know, to be that communicative. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1901.08s)]
*  And as John mentioned, I've also had a lot of interaction with John and with the CTO, David Dismouk. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1912.08s)]
*  They're also there for us anytime, which is also rare. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1918.08s)]
*  And it's and it's not it's not going above the team's head. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1922.08s)]
*  It's just there's sometimes you want to get a different perspective or just have a discussion and and a very, you know, very professional group. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1925.08s)]
*  Working together is key to meeting biopharma's goals, especially as the development of new drugs and delivery methods continue to advance human health. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1935.08s)]
*  Join us each week as we discuss the changing landscape of biologics manufacturing and how you can meet your need for speed, efficiency and flexibility. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1944.08s)]
*  The pod is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva, a global provider of technologies and services that advance and accelerate the development, manufacture and delivery of therapeutics. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1953.08s)]
*  Check out their resources at Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1964.08s)]
*  John, I'm not going to ask you the first question that popped in my head listening to Jenny's response for you was how does Forge enable that level of attentiveness? [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1969.08s)]
*  I'm not going to ask you that question because it's going to give you too easy a softball. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1979.08s)]
*  And it's I have an answer if you'd like to hear it, but now I'm happy to hear another question. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1984.08s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to twist the question sort of a different way to make it easier for you to answer. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1988.08s)]
*  I'm going to I'm going to twist the question sort of a different way to make it not come not you know not give you an opportunity to commercialize but but true. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=1995.08s)]
*  But to be give you an opportunity to instruct our listeners. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2004.08s)]
*  If I'm a you know a preclinical biopharmaceutical company and I'm and I'm looking to test that accessibility among a group of CDMOs. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2008.08s)]
*  The accessibility that Jenny just described which is fantastic you know details very specific. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2021.08s)]
*  How do I test that? How do I like how do how do I test that out with them with a number of potential CDMOs to feel like I'm ensured that I'm going to have that access going in? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2026.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, here's a good way. And I think you're right. I think it's also about a little bit about how you conduct your diligence on your CDMOs. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2037.08s)]
*  You should and everyone should always look at multiple CDMOs and make sure they have the right fit and the right right interaction with your team. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2045.08s)]
*  But I think the way you know and this may be a little bit of my past activity you know when I was doing my own searches. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2053.08s)]
*  But we see a lot of clients do this is visit them like physically visit them and if one of you can get a visit and get a tour. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2061.08s)]
*  That's a good start. There are actually are CDMOs that won't do that. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2068.08s)]
*  You know they say we don't give tours you know or you know we can show you a video our facility and upon that visit who actually attends your meetings and who comes in and says hello and actually walks you through these sections. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2072.08s)]
*  And I can tell you that David myself are very common features in those intro meetings and we do that. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2085.08s)]
*  There's a reason for it too. We want to show that we're committed and also the show that Forge is sustainable and come and see who's leading Forge and come see it's a sustainable business. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2092.08s)]
*  And give you some comfort you know new new potential client you know you deserve that coming in here even if you're a seed round group with great tech and you know still waiting on your series A. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2101.08s)]
*  But you want to start with some early research work they they they should be they should receive the same service you know in our opinion. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2113.08s)]
*  So the other way we sort of manage it too is we don't we were very careful to overload our teams. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2120.08s)]
*  And by that I mean you know you have to carry so many representatives not you know there should be a threshold that representative actually sort of manages right. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2127.08s)]
*  So you know you don't want a client relations manager who has 30 clients all in GMP runs right. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2136.08s)]
*  That'll be how do you white go of a service like that you just can't. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2143.08s)]
*  Right. So so we're very careful with our hiring you know we obviously don't over hire but we want to also make sure that we're we keep our our touch points very well. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2146.08s)]
*  So we we actually monitor these actual numbers and make sure we're maintaining through the sort of lifecycle of our clients work. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2155.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2162.08s)]
*  Jenny you know it's been there's been it's been sunshine and roses the conversation so far and that's fantastic and specific like I appreciate the fact that you neither of you are you know addition addition me platitudes you give me specific examples. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2165.08s)]
*  But surely bumps in the road come along. So how do you give it give us some flavor on how you guys work together to tackle challenges that you might face like some maybe some of the unforeseen and then you know we're collaboratively to fix those challenges. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2180.08s)]
*  Yeah. Well as you know drug development I think especially gene therapy drug development and all its functions is difficult and there can be challenges that is unfortunately normal. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2199.08s)]
*  It's not an easy job. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2211.08s)]
*  It's not an easy job. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2213.08s)]
*  And with there's any challenges on the manufacturing side. We always grab on to forges technical experts first and I have the technical experts I speak to on a weekly basis, but they will then and the client relations manager will go grab additional technical experts as needed if there's something we really need to discuss [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2215.08s)]
*  What is that next best step? What is that next best step? And sometimes then David Dismit gets his input and so that's usually the approach we have to take a holistic look at you know what's the challenge what's the technical aspects what are the options and then take it internally and go okay what's the best choice for Ray Therapeutics? [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2236.08s)]
*  What's that best choice next step and what are the risks? And so that's usually our approach and we're you know working with Forge on that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2256.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean I guess if I flip that question around I mean you know in any for any outsource manufacturer you probably face client challenges as well like clients may create challenges for Forge at times right John? So I mean not that I'm using Ray as an example I'm sure there. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2264.08s)]
*  It's not Ray. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2286.08s)]
*  You're perfect. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2287.08s)]
*  Yes, sure. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2288.08s)]
*  John I'd welcome you to give me a little bit of color on that though like I mean challenge you know the manufacturing challenges can come from all sorts of places to Johnny's point this is not an easy space. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2291.08s)]
*  So what sort of the default position at Forge around like okay when something goes unexpectedly or when we have a problem that we're having trouble solving, here's our de facto approach. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2304.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'll give you a sort of a two tiered answer. One is we actually carry our own molecular development group. So by that I mean these are molecular PhD scientists who can actually evaluate sequences and determine if we actually see potential pitfalls priority even producing you know scale up plasmids to even make a V. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2315.08s)]
*  So we we offer this as a service to our clients. We actually sometimes do this work also to make sure you know is there anything here that we can see that might cause problems down the road right so I like it because it's a more of a proactive approach to a program that can cut time up front even though you may spend a little time going through some upfront evaluations. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2341.08s)]
*  So we think that helps with success rate but to your good point too you know with all the variability of sizes of genes of interest and stereotypes obviously there's variability where you know if we have issues arise you know Jenny sort of alluded to it but we when we find things you know if we were to find something there's a triage task force that comes and looks at this with our experts and what I think is important is to come to the client with actual ideas. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2361.08s)]
*  You know walking to a meeting go oh we got a problem good luck or you know what do you think you know I think that comes across a little bit naive if you're a you know self tatted CDMO manufacturing expert and you go into the client with no answer no not even an option so you know what we like to do is at least create a few options knowing that the every client is a different level of sort of flexibility you know some some would rather go back and do more characterization work some just wants to move ahead as quickly as possible. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2391.08s)]
*  So we try to come up with solutions that you know sort of need both ideas or you know whatever is custom fit to the client but we do think it's important to make sure we're at that meeting with actual data and so the path of the idea that's been sort of stamped by our leadership including David and folks. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2421.08s)]
*  Yeah very good. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2438.08s)]
*  Jenny how do you how do you measure success at the end of the day I mean if I know Paul wouldn't do this because Paul it's just not in his nature I'm sure I'm sure he's capable of having the hard conversation. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2440.08s)]
*  But at the end of the day like he you know he could walk into the in your office and be like I need you Jenny to hand me a report that is proving the value of the money we're spending on forged biologics I need success metrics in my hands because I have to turn around and go to the board and justify all this money that we're spending in this engagement. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2453.08s)]
*  Now I'm not going to ask you to give me that report right now but maybe the Cliffs notes like if you if Paul did demand such a such a report how would you go about sort of measuring or quantifying the success of your project. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2474.08s)]
*  That's a great question. Pretty easy to answer I believe because we do have a number of contracts and activities with Forge and some of which we've completed some of those activities and actually have closed out and completed some contracts. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2491.08s)]
*  So for me it's well here is our original budget and timeline. Here's where we landed. You know where we on time around budget and what was a deliverable. And so for me it's it would just be summarizing that and and showing you what value we got out of the money spent. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2512.08s)]
*  And in that way and then and then what's next you know and of course a lot of a lot of a lot of budgets you do some prepaid and okay here here's what we're working on now here's what's next and that is how we'll measure success of that next deliverable. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2533.08s)]
*  So it's actually pretty easy it would be it'd be more of a I think in tables and bullet points I'd probably put a table together and show you know we contracted for this this is when it was delivered this is what was the deliverable compared to what the original request was. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2550.08s)]
*  Yeah. Does thought go into like a company like Ray and you're you're assessing potential outsourcing partners. Does this thought go into like how far downfield this partner will be able to help you get the ball. So for instance Ray is early right. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2567.08s)]
*  Like you're not like it. Do you have a phase one clinical candidate quite yet. Yes yes yes we have a candidate we're not in the clinic yet but we have our candidate. Yeah. So like so so does does does the stock go into like OK if we if we sign on with Forge like and things go swimmingly as we anticipate they will with our with our candidate based on the science that we know. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2589.08s)]
*  You know we're confident Forge is going to be able to take us like all the way through clinical supply for instance or what sort of the thought process there. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2614.08s)]
*  I mean exactly that and we do discuss that with Forge already. You know we have what we were in the process of getting our first trial open phase one. And so what do we need for that. And then what's and what's next. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2624.08s)]
*  And towards commercial I mean we think far ahead. You know we want to we want to plan for commercial early and we've already have with Forge you know establishing what what we are doing with Forge now can pivot to commercial and as well as we're starting U.S. based clinical trials. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2640.08s)]
*  But also we've been discussing with Forge their capabilities to release for EU. So those are important conversations and we confirm things with Forge and make sure like you know are we are we going to be able to move all through trials and into other countries with Forge. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2658.08s)]
*  And I think the answer is yes. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2675.08s)]
*  John as it relates to those things give us some again put your put your C level bio pharma hat on you know hearken back to those days and now having the experience at Forge because I know you're going to tell me like yeah the capabilities are all there which is which is great. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2678.08s)]
*  But what questions to validate the things that Jenny just just talked about what questions should should should new biotechs be asking. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2693.08s)]
*  Yeah and I think they're important ones. Matt the the the really the sort of where Jenny's alluding to sort of the sort of the end to end capabilities and I know I'm sounds like that now I'm selling again for Forge but. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2701.08s)]
*  No no like I said you pose pose it in the you know in the context of like these are the things you should be looking for. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2717.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. No. And precisely. And I think one thing you know and having done this in my past as well you know keep referring to some of the things I've seen you know there's a lot of regulatory risk and actually moving products around through its lifecycle. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2722.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2738.08s)]
*  You know comparability is very difficult. Lucky if you can do analytical once you're starting clinical trials and I'm talking about the potential potential to have the need for clinical comparability especially if you're in pivotal trials. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2740.08s)]
*  That becomes a challenge on a program that really you know is on a delivery timeline and can add a lot of time and not only that you're dealing with licensing of cell lines and materials and things that you may have had at university. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2751.08s)]
*  Now you're bringing to an industrial CDMO. So you know one thing is that you know we always want to look for is how much can we do under one roof. So not only can we have that continuity from discovery through the clinical process for comparability but also how do we manage this. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2764.08s)]
*  We're a small team you know how many project managers do we need to look at who's doing analytical testing who's doing the actual manufacturing who's doing cold chain and then I also have a seeded team that's doing the [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2780.08s)]
*  I also have you know I have medical monitors and things like that so it becomes a little bit of a corporate issue you know how do we continue to manage. So that's that's why we design a little bit more of an under one roof approach. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2788.08s)]
*  We also think it's a bit cost effective as well from you know from a processing and an audit standpoint. So I think you know for folks who are out there shopping at a CDMO you know think about the cost of the product. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2798.08s)]
*  And then you have to hope they're all talking together. You know contract lab my samples are on the way well you know we missed them on the dock they're going to get testing next week you know stability pull was missed because you know we had four other [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2809.08s)]
*  projects that were missing. So you know that's where we're going to be working on that and then we're going to be working on the other projects that were missing. So that's where we're going to be working on that. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2815.08s)]
*  And then you have to hope they're all talking together. Hey you know contract lab my samples are on the way well you know we missed them on the dock they're going to get tested next week. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2825.08s)]
*  You know stability pull was missed because you know we had four others that we were from another client. These are sort of things you might want to think about when you're doing your actual selections and again making sure they have the capabilities to go to commercial like when [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2835.08s)]
*  Jenny is also mentioning producing for Europe you need to keep you QP designation to do that and you know not only for the lots themselves but the actual facility producing them and you know have you probably scaled up to a late stage commercial design for your [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2851.08s)]
*  air flows and your cleaner and designs and everything. So I think that's all you know take a look at all those aspects prior to making any decisions because what you don't want to do somewhere is have to start contemplating an expensive move that can cause a big delay. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2868.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah and I've got a question around that too and I know we're getting a bit short on time you guys okay for a few more. Sure for me. Yeah. Okay. Good. Yeah. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2882.08s)]
*  Jenny you mentioned when I asked when I put you on the spot and ask you how you'd respond to a Paul Bresge grilling about about your your investment in Forge. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2893.08s)]
*  You mentioned some some completed contracts. Can you can you kind of [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2903.08s)]
*  I guess briefly take us through or give us some give it give us some color on what your outsourced partner has helped you sort of achieve to this point sort of project outcomes like how how you know maybe maybe how far you've been able to move the ball down [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2909.08s)]
*  field preparing for for phase one that you otherwise you know may not have without the right partner. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2926.08s)]
*  Right. Absolutely. We really partnered up with Forge and contracted soups to nuts manufacturing. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2932.08s)]
*  You know we have completed our master cell banks plasma manufacturing including GMP manufacturing of plasmas which is great doing it under one roof because then you know the plasma team and that deliverables in touch with the GMP production team and you know you don't have to try to ship things around the country. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2940.08s)]
*  It's all right there. And so we have we have completed those tasks and in support of GMP production we have completed a number of research production lots to support a number of nonclinical activities that we need moving towards our I.N.D. filing and clinic. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2960.08s)]
*  And we have we're initiated initiating our GMP manufacturing run. So that you know that's the big one and it's exciting that we've reached that point and a lot of activity right now with the team on that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2982.08s)]
*  And so I hope that answers your question. We're just really full bore ahead towards the clinic with Forge. Yeah. Yeah. Very good. That question that I had that I just referenced. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=2996.08s)]
*  You know John said something about a move the cost of a move. It's funny you should say that because I've read a lot of research some of it some of it like I'd like to cite but there's there's some proprietary research I've read but even just the anecdotal sense that I get spending time talking with biopharma companies that outsource development manufacturing is that like once you're committed you know they're loath to make a change. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3008.08s)]
*  You commit a lot of time energy expense until intellect. It's it's not an insignificant endeavor to say you know what things aren't working out with Forge. Let's look at X. Right. Like it's not an insignificant. Nobody wants to do that. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3036.08s)]
*  Nobody wants to do that for understandable reasons but there's got to be times where it's justifiable. I mean people you know people are forced to do it. What what is like if I'm if I'm in a bad relationship and things aren't working out what's justifiable what's considered cause for a switch. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3052.08s)]
*  I mean I want your perspective on this first like what would be considered cause for a change in your CDMO selection. Yes I mean you one if they weren't able to have a process that supports a pivotal trial or commercial or commercial process. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3072.08s)]
*  I mean some CDO some CDOs don't they really are early phase only. So you have to plan that switch early on and that tech transfer. So that is definitely justifiable. And of course there's I've seen switches happen because you do not have communication. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3088.08s)]
*  The activities and deliverables aren't happening and you're getting delayed and delayed and more money spent but you're not getting what you want. And you've as a company you've got to work to hit your timeline. So those are hard decisions. I mean it really has to go south to do that. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3107.08s)]
*  But I've seen that happen with others. And but for me a more logical one is if they can't support your full clinical development program to commercial you have to think early on when and how do we do the switch. And it is a it's a big task. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3124.08s)]
*  Yeah I can only imagine John I'm a let you comment on that but your comment cannot be what's justifiable like what's cause for a switch. If your CDMO name doesn't start with an F. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3140.08s)]
*  Talk about how folks have switched to us right. Maybe they'll talk about that one either. If you have specific examples of a previous CDMO's failure like the specific failure causing the switch. This is what I want my listeners to come away with like you know. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3150.08s)]
*  Yeah I think here's one I think everything Jenny is talking about is usually a lot of the reasons. But one I'll add is you know sometimes CDMO's run their business on who is their biggest clients. And sometimes big clients start taking a lot of attention. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3166.08s)]
*  And I've seen multiple and you know talking through networks folks who had to walk from a CDMO strictly for lack of attention you know which is why we were very careful about. I mentioned earlier about ratios of clients versus our client relations representatives. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3186.08s)]
*  They look you know they see a revenue source and their cases and they're saying well we're going to divert our attention there and you know we think that's got a high rate of success. Some of them track those types of clients very closely to actually look at their percent chance of success even on revenue based on their clinical progress. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3202.08s)]
*  And I think that's an unfortunate approach because then you lose a lot of the innovation that's coming behind it. So you know to add on to things like you know lack of lack of platform expansion lack of ability to sort of you know move to commercial. I also think you have to make sure they have the right mindset to see the sort of you know see the sort of sort of the long term plan and really stick with you through that plan. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3222.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Very good. Jenny your thought on that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3242.08s)]
*  I have to agree with your first comment John about the attention. Because in my many of my past experience is that lack of attention from CDMOs who socially have had to work with the CDMOs and they're not going to be able to do that. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3246.08s)]
*  And that's very difficult. And so I love that you guys have your business model to avoid that. So I just yeah I was nodding is I totally agree that. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3258.08s)]
*  That's a huge one that I've seen again and again and again. You just have to leave. You have to leave that relationship. It's a bad relationship. You got to go somewhere else. And that's it's hard but I think that's a huge one. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3268.08s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. All right. Like I said we're running over here which I could do. I could go another hour. You guys up for another hour. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3278.08s)]
*  But I could I could. This has been super informative and enjoyable. You guys are both great. But what we'll leave you with is that I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3286.08s)]
*  I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one. I think that's a huge one.

*  to spend more time with Forge for my own learnings. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3356.08s)]
*  We trust them and their technical expertise so much. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3363.2799999999997s)]
*  And that's why we've added on in our team, [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3367.62s)]
*  I'm a VP of CMC to help with their therapeutics time, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3370.12s)]
*  in that partnership, we have to spend our time as well. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3375.68s)]
*  So I'm happy about that. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3380.34s)]
*  But I wouldn't change anything on the work we have done [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3381.68s)]
*  and have planned with Forge. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3385.88s)]
*  And I look forward to what those next steps are [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3387.1600000000003s)]
*  as we go into clinical development [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3390.08s)]
*  and planning those future needs with them. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3391.8s)]
*  That's a, yeah, I mean, that's fair. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3396.48s)]
*  And probably a more fair way to answer the question [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3398.7200000000003s)]
*  or to ask the question that is would be, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3401.56s)]
*  you know, you mentioned that you brought on a CMC resource [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3404.04s)]
*  that's engaged in the Forge relationship. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3406.44s)]
*  As you take next steps, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3408.92s)]
*  what like maybe a more fair question would be like, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3412.7200000000003s)]
*  what would you like next? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3416.84s)]
*  Like, what would you like next [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3417.7200000000003s)]
*  in the progression of the relationship? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3419.08s)]
*  Whether that's another resource at Ray [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3420.6800000000003s)]
*  on the CMC or quality side, [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3423.7400000000002s)]
*  or whether that's, I don't know, to be cloned [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3425.6400000000003s)]
*  because you need more time. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3428.2000000000003s)]
*  Like, what would you like to see next? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3429.56s)]
*  A little bit of everything. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3432.0s)]
*  Well, we have big milestones of getting the clinic [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3434.0s)]
*  and we're very, as a company, very focused on that, [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3436.92s)]
*  including the successful release [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3439.76s)]
*  of our first GMP lock from Forge. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3441.92s)]
*  And what I wanna see next, you know, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3445.0s)]
*  is kind of get over that hump, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3446.72s)]
*  but we're also, we need to start discussing what's next. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3448.84s)]
*  And that's really important. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3453.36s)]
*  You know, we have a lot of plans [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3456.68s)]
*  and if we're successful in our first phase one, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3459.36s)]
*  we have a lot of patients that we wanna reach [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3462.12s)]
*  with these rare retinal-blinding diseases. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3466.2s)]
*  So there's so much to do and it's very much on my mind [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3468.72s)]
*  to have that time to spend those discussions [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3474.04s)]
*  and those discussions with Forge. [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3475.7999999999997s)]
*  So I don't know if that answers your question, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3478.68s)]
*  but they're just, that's the focus, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3479.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of get past where we are now for the next month or two, [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3481.8399999999997s)]
*  but we have to start planning that future out in detail. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3485.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, all right. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3490.3599999999997s)]
*  John, I'll give you the option. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3491.24s)]
*  You can either answer the question [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3493.52s)]
*  that we asked the first or second of Jenny. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3495.16s)]
*  You know, you can either give me your thoughts on, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3497.3999999999996s)]
*  like, if you had a redo to fix something [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3499.48s)]
*  or do something differently [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3501.66s)]
*  with the Ray Therapeutics relationship, what would it be? [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3502.58s)]
*  Or I'll let you off the hook and say, like, [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3505.7s)]
*  what would you like to see next? [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3507.66s)]
*  Well, I think, yeah, no, it's a good question. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3509.3799999999997s)]
*  John's gonna answer both those questions. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3511.8999999999996s)]
*  I know Dan will answer both those questions. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3514.7s)]
*  It's probably gonna be a hybrid answer, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3517.3399999999997s)]
*  but I am, unfortunately, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3520.18s)]
*  there's not a lot of controversy with Ray, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3522.3799999999997s)]
*  so I apologize in advance, but they're a wonderful client. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3524.54s)]
*  They're intelligent. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3528.22s)]
*  They know this business. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3529.06s)]
*  They're like our favorite kinds of clients to have, [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3531.94s)]
*  so we're not, we're sort of talking to the, [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3533.7400000000002s)]
*  we're speaking to the choir with them. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3538.34s)]
*  They know how to advance drugs. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3539.78s)]
*  They know their targets and what they need to do, [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3542.34s)]
*  so it's a lot easier to be collaborative, [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3544.34s)]
*  but I'll speak more generally [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3547.26s)]
*  that I would like to actually see more integration. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3550.1400000000003s)]
*  I know I touched about this a little earlier, [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3552.78s)]
*  but we do see groups who, I think, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3554.6200000000003s)]
*  have some raising and some interesting tech, [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3558.94s)]
*  but maybe aren't from our space, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3562.9s)]
*  and I think are a lot larger gap of learning to, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3564.98s)]
*  let me give you, for examples, for the gap to [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3570.38s)]
*  what is really needed to create a preclinical study [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3573.82s)]
*  for a G30 candidate. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3576.2200000000003s)]
*  What are the components taken, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3578.98s)]
*  what's bio-distribution really about, [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3580.38s)]
*  and then really what are realistic sort of timing [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3582.5800000000004s)]
*  for clinical phases? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3585.34s)]
*  Like if you come with me with the GOI and say, [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3587.14s)]
*  you're gonna be commercial in two years, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3589.7799999999997s)]
*  we probably need a broader discussion. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3591.58s)]
*  So what I think is if there's a bit of a way to [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3593.9s)]
*  meet with these teams early, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3598.02s)]
*  speak more about the industry for the ones [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3600.3799999999997s)]
*  who are a little less sort of knowledgeable, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3603.54s)]
*  and help them actually, like, look, [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3606.46s)]
*  we're not trying to be an investment bank [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3608.98s)]
*  to help them do their raising, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3613.46s)]
*  but we can give some advice about what that looks like. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3614.66s)]
*  So when you go to pitch for series A, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3617.7400000000002s)]
*  it doesn't sound impossible, quite frankly. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3619.14s)]
*  And also, I touched on molecular development. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3624.14s)]
*  Luckily that's in place now. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3627.1s)]
*  There are clients that would have loved to have that earlier, [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3630.42s)]
*  so they can actually benefit from some of the [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3632.94s)]
*  sequencing analysis or some of the early ideas [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3636.38s)]
*  and maybe cut down some of the early research work. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3638.94s)]
*  But luckily that's in place now, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3642.5s)]
*  and I've actually seen the impact on that in some clients [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3644.3s)]
*  who either had a very old sequence that they haven't, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3647.0200000000004s)]
*  they've had in the sort of drawer for a while [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3650.7000000000003s)]
*  and they wanna go back and look at it, [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3652.5400000000004s)]
*  like, oh, by the way, there are some sequences here [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3653.9s)]
*  that may cause some issues for you, [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3657.82s)]
*  or maybe you may wanna look at your ITRs [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3659.1400000000003s)]
*  or where you're actually positioning. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3661.78s)]
*  So I think that what I'm trying to get to a little bit here [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3663.94s)]
*  is is there ways to help clients be successful sooner [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3667.26s)]
*  in their programs and see, like, don't lose a year. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3671.42s)]
*  I've seen it, you know, lose a year in funding. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3674.42s)]
*  We all know there are great programs out there [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3677.5s)]
*  who just don't get to the finish line [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3679.7400000000002s)]
*  because of some of these things, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3681.58s)]
*  and it's unfortunate for patients. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3682.86s)]
*  So there's a way to sort of cut through some of that noise. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3684.6600000000003s)]
*  I'd love to add that to their programs. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3686.78s)]
*  Yeah, very thoughtful, very thoughtful response. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3688.86s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3692.46s)]
*  I'm gonna let you both off the hook. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3694.58s)]
*  I know there's more to be said, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3695.7400000000002s)]
*  and I hope we have the opportunity [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3697.5s)]
*  to get to the more that's to be said, you know, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3699.66s)]
*  at a later date. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3702.18s)]
*  But in the meantime, I'm gonna let you off the hook, [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3704.46s)]
*  and I'm gonna thank you both. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3706.4199999999996s)]
*  You're both fantastic. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3707.4199999999996s)]
*  I thought this was very valuable, engaging, and fun. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3708.8199999999997s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3713.8999999999996s)]
*  I'd like to say, Matt, [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3714.74s)]

*  that was a long time ago, [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3734.3799999999997s)]
*  and we were focused, not largely, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3735.3799999999997s)]
*  yeah, we were mostly focused on your internal pipeline, [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3737.58s)]
*  which is sort of our, we're with us. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAEIioZJqt0&t=3740.3399999999997s)]
