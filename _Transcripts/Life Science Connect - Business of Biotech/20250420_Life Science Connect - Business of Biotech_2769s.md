Video Description: Business of Biotech MVP Allan Shaw is back to talk about the rise of China's biotech sector, and its evolution from fast follower to global innovation powerhouse. Increased deal activity with Chinese biopharmaceutical companies is injecting new risk into traditional development models in the West, despite an uncertain policy environment in the U.S. vis-Ã -vis China. Will faster trial starts, cheaper asset upfronts, and a growing talent base slingshot Shanghai's biotech hub into an innovation destination on par with Boston and San Francisco?

# The Implications Of China's Growing Biotech Industry With Allan Shaw
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk)
*  Welcome back to the Business of Biotech. I'm your host Ben Comer, Chief Editor at Life [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=0.0s)]
*  Science Leader, and today I'm grateful to have a Business of Biotech MVP on the show, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=9.32s)]
*  Alan Shaw. Alan has been a five-time public company COO. He's served on a number of board [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=15.96s)]
*  of directors, and I'm happy to have him here to talk about a very timely subject, Chinese [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=23.66s)]
*  Biotech, which has become something of a go-to source of innovation for global big pharma and [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=30.62s)]
*  biotech alike. Deal activity has been robust in recent months. To use just one example, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=37.86s)]
*  Merck has since last November announced three multi-billion dollar out licensing deals with [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=46.02s)]
*  Chinese biotech companies, and Merck is certainly not the only company doing deals in China and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=54.580000000000005s)]
*  eyeing new opportunities. Lillian Novo Nordisk are two other recent examples of companies doing [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=60.7s)]
*  big deals in China, but fortunately we have Alan on as our guest to explain what's behind [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=67.38s)]
*  China's growing biopharmaceutical industry and why Western companies have become so keen on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=73.61999999999999s)]
*  Chinese biotech and what it all means. Thanks for being here, Alan. Thanks a lot, Ben. Always glad [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  to be here and quite excited to do an episode with you now. Really looking forward to chatting about [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=87.06s)]
*  China with you and the episodes that go forward from here. Likewise, Alan, thank you. I really [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=95.82s)]
*  appreciate your willingness to move on from Matt and be on an episode with me. More to come. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=102.62s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. So a lot of big pharmas set up affiliates in China in the 1990s in [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=109.5s)]
*  anticipation, I think, of China's growing middle class, expanded healthcare benefits with the idea [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=119.94s)]
*  of commercializing more products for the Chinese market, but that's not really what we're talking [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=126.66s)]
*  about today. Of course, that's still happening, but what we're talking about is the dramatic [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=132.82s)]
*  growth of China's own biotech industry over the last decade. Alan, what is driving that surge and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=137.7s)]
*  how did we get here? It's an interesting evolution that we've been witnessing. I would say that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  China's rise in biotech is the result of a deliberate and well executed strategy that combines [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=155.66s)]
*  policy, talent and capital investment. But there's several factors that I think specifically have [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=162.22s)]
*  really been drivers behind this. You know, we've done a really good job of training a lot of Chinese [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=168.98s)]
*  top scientists here in the United States, and we've done such a good job that they've been able to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=175.38s)]
*  bring back this world class expertise and repopulate that very effectively over in China [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=181.5s)]
*  and have developed very strong networks. The Chinese government have also prioritized biotech [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=189.78s)]
*  as a strategic industry, and they've been providing a lot of funding and incentives to help drive [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=196.74s)]
*  innovation and really grow that. When I was over in Suzhou prior to COVID, it was like walking in [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=203.98s)]
*  Cambridge really, and that's part of the greater Shanghai hub that we'll be hearing more and more [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=212.17999999999998s)]
*  about in the future. They have really a much lower cost workforce. Their PhDs are literally a dime [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=220.42s)]
*  a dozen over there, and that really enables much more cost effective ways of doing things [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=230.74s)]
*  compared to other parts of the world. And their regulatory environment is also perhaps some people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=238.9s)]
*  would argue a little loose, but it does enable faster pathways, making it an interesting place [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=248.18s)]
*  for development, but certainly been a very fertile area for R&D right now. And so all of these factors [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=254.66s)]
*  have really created a dynamic biotech ecosystem that is really starting to really step onto the global [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=264.02s)]
*  stage, and I look forward to talking about the implications. Yeah, that's absolutely right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=270.74s)]
*  I mentioned in the intro, Western pharma companies have been increasingly striking deals with Chinese [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=280.26000000000005s)]
*  biotech firms. I gave a couple of examples in Merck and Lilly and Novo, which were just the couple [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=288.34000000000003s)]
*  that occurred to me. Can you quantify how significant that shift has become? Yes, it's growing like a weed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=295.62s)]
*  You only have to go back five years ago, and approximately, if you look at $50 million as [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=307.38s)]
*  your threshold cut off, that represented about 5% of the global deals were originated out of China. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=314.5s)]
*  You fast forward to this past year, according to data out there, and that represents almost 30% [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=321.62s)]
*  of the deals that are licensed or originating out of China. That's really significantly [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  exponential growth, and it involves, besides Merck, AZ, GSK, and as you touched on, there was a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=336.18s)]
*  recent Merck LP little a deal, and we'll be hearing a lot more about LP little a as a clinical standard [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=347.22s)]
*  of care in cardiology, but there's opportunities, to say the least. And not only are the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=353.94s)]
*  strategics going over there, but there's a lot of investors also going over there and taking [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=362.82000000000005s)]
*  advantage of the opportunity to really harvest the crops and the availability of assets over there. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=370.66s)]
*  Beijing RTW are pouring hundreds of million dollars into Chinese biotechs, and the rationale [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=380.82000000000005s)]
*  for this is a confluence of factors. The Chinese companies are producing high-quality drugs, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=387.54s)]
*  often biosimilars, or bio-betters actually, not biosimilars, that enhance existing therapies. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=393.54s)]
*  At a fraction of Western development courses, I referenced their inputs are just so much less. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=401.14000000000004s)]
*  And also, what's contributed to this is their capital market system has really blown up over [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=408.66s)]
*  there. So you've got a lot of needy companies. I guess they're even needier than ours. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=414.34s)]
*  And so right now, because so many of them are also clustering around similar targets, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=425.29999999999995s)]
*  it's really giving a whole new meaning to Chinese menus. And they're really, so it's really a buyer's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=432.65999999999997s)]
*  market in China right now. And what's makes and what I think underscores some of that, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=440.1s)]
*  and this is according to a recent white paper that Locust War put out, that the upfront payments [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=446.18s)]
*  are significantly lower than those in the paid from the United States, almost like two times lower. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=455.38s)]
*  You know, like you're paying almost 5%. I think if you used US metrics, the upfront used to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  represent about 10% of the total deal value. Now, if you go into China, you're paying about 5%. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=469.94s)]
*  You know, so that's a big difference. And it makes it smaller upfront. Yeah. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=476.9s)]
*  And the shift, this shift really underscores the growing role of Chinese biotech and global [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=483.78s)]
*  innovation landscape, and highlights the increasing appetite of companies for accessing these low, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=488.98s)]
*  low cost effective assets. You know, it also implies that there is money that's leaving the [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=495.62s)]
*  traditional ecosystem as well. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And you know, you mentioned [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=502.9s)]
*  the government heavily subsidizing the biotech industry in China. And you know, we've seen this [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=510.34s)]
*  in other sectors as well in electric cars. Everybody heard about deep seek [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=516.98s)]
*  in AI. And it seems like what and just thinking about those two industries, what they have in [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=524.1800000000001s)]
*  common, seemingly, is that they're creating a technology, you know, similar or better to what [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=530.98s)]
*  exists in other global markets, and yet significantly cheaper. You know, aside from it, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=538.58s)]
*  how are they able to do that? I guess aside from is it all government subsidies that allows, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=546.02s)]
*  you know, the Chinese market to develop drugs to build electric cars, to create AI, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=551.3s)]
*  algorithms and apps cheap more cheaply? You know, it's it's it's you know, it's it's really a great [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=558.66s)]
*  question. And I think, you know, you can go a lot of different places with it. But you know, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=567.38s)]
*  you know, you can also look at how we do things. And I think there's a lot of legacy [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=572.98s)]
*  practices in the way we we develop drugs. You know, we spend a lot of time on animal models. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=577.86s)]
*  How many times, you know, and then we all often say these, these, these animal models don't [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=584.9000000000001s)]
*  translate. You know, so you know, you're putting a lot of layers in your process there. You know, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=589.3000000000001s)]
*  we can talk about the clinical drug process too. That's, that's got a lot of layers of yesterday [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=594.74s)]
*  built into that. And there are probably more effective, more cost effective ways, particularly [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=601.22s)]
*  when you start looking at developing the drugs for chronic diseases, where you need multiple [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=608.02s)]
*  phase twos, you need to power these studies. And you know, what you're doing is you're selling a [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=613.78s)]
*  suit off the rack. And we know that that, you know, people are an off the rack. So you know, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=618.98s)]
*  there's a lot of disconnects from you know, what we're doing in the studies. So you know, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  when you superimpose that back to China, you know, they're not necessarily doing that, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=630.74s)]
*  you know, they're cutting out a lot of the upfront animal work, you know, and they go right into [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=636.74s)]
*  humans. And I often quip that human models translate so much better. Yeah, yeah, right. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=642.9s)]
*  No, that's a really interesting point. They may not have the same kinds of, you know, incremental [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=649.94s)]
*  base costs, you know, that that farm that big pharma has developed over years, some of which, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=656.98s)]
*  you know, is probably wasteful or needs to be redesigned to be more efficient, they may not [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=663.7s)]
*  have the same base costs in China. Absolutely. Now, if you're going to be, you know, scouting [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=669.94s)]
*  and trying to bring in assets, you know, are you going to be better with a molecule or anybody [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=676.02s)]
*  that's been in man? Or are you going to be happier with a molecule that's been in a mouse or a rat or [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=684.74s)]
*  monkey for that matter? I know what I'd be happier with. No, so you know, there's so you can really [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=690.82s)]
*  de risk things and run the so called killer experiment a lot sooner and get better results [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=697.62s)]
*  that translate. And because costs are cheaper over there, they have cost advantages besides speed [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=706.02s)]
*  and efficiency. And the science has become very, very, very, very good over there. You know, there's [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=711.86s)]
*  certainly, you know, they've they've come up with that the new PDO one veg F that, you know, keys [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=719.0600000000001s)]
*  are developing with summit. But, you know, there's a lot of other great, great things that are that [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=725.86s)]
*  they're doing over there. And then as you touched on, you know, depending on your partnerships, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=730.58s)]
*  you know, you could potentially open up access to, you know, a population of billions. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=736.34s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, right. I saw a Simon Kuker report recently that had that showed in 2023, which was [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=742.34s)]
*  the most recent data in the report, 39% of all clinical trials phase one through four were [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=751.94s)]
*  happening in China in 2023, which was, you know, a dramatic increase just in, you know, the five [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=759.7s)]
*  years prior to 2023, which I think reflects that, you know, continuing interest in commercializing [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=766.82s)]
*  drugs in China, but it also reflects, you know, what what you're talking about, the growing amount [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=774.0200000000001s)]
*  of Chinese initiated clinical research and the real strength in R&D that they've developed. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=780.26s)]
*  Now, indeed, and I think you need to also distinguish between the studies that are being [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=787.22s)]
*  run for commercialization purposes in China, versus those that are being run straight efficacy [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=792.98s)]
*  as as well. Because at least some of the noise that I've been hearing from folks when I when I [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=801.14s)]
*  talk about, you know, this this new trend or phenomenon, or, you know, it's hard to call it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=807.38s)]
*  a phenomenon, it's real. But it is the fact that I think people find that it's a great place to get [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=813.06s)]
*  early stage stuff. You know, I don't think people are really relying on for a lot of reasons on the [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=820.9799999999999s)]
*  stuff that's being developed. Yeah, in the in the clinic, from the baseline drug development. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=829.06s)]
*  And the perception is that they have not they haven't, I guess they have not imported enough [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=838.26s)]
*  chops, in order to do actually do the clinical development in a way that people would feel [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=844.18s)]
*  comfortable with. And yeah, I think the FDA is more or less kind of expressed that view, not to [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=850.26s)]
*  mention the fact that I think there's some pretty strict Chinese laws about transferring [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=857.62s)]
*  health data from Chinese nationals outside of the country. So I don't know, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=864.26s)]
*  you know, if if that prevents some of the exchange or back and forth in clinical development [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=868.8199999999999s)]
*  programs, obviously, in most countries, you have to conduct clinical trials in the country where [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=875.06s)]
*  you want to commercialize a drug, not always the case is sort of depends on some circumstances. But [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=880.66s)]
*  I've had some people more than one person mentioned that to me as as something that [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=888.1s)]
*  I think there are workarounds that have been established. But nevertheless, it's not as easy [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=892.9799999999999s)]
*  as conducting a phase two trial in China or a phase three trial in China. And, you know, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=898.5799999999999s)]
*  submitting that to the FDA, you know, to get a drug approved in the US, as Lily found out, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=906.02s)]
*  you know, with their PD one back in 2022. No, exactly. You know, I think the playbook is to [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=912.02s)]
*  get the acid early and then develop it yourself before it can be screwed up or [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=920.82s)]
*  and do it with your goalposts, your measurements and answer the questions and the under your control [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=927.22s)]
*  and with assurance that the underlying data is reflective of the experiments. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=933.1400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So so strong preclinical assets, not at a premium at a lower cost for acquisition. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  Is that what's primarily driving Western big pharma and investors to seek out [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=950.5s)]
*  Chinese biotech partnerships and deals? Yeah. And I think they're looking at later stage [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=957.7800000000001s)]
*  programs to depending, you know, depending on the expertise. But yeah, I think you've nailed that. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=964.9000000000001s)]
*  And, you know, it really, you know, gives them the opportunity to, you know, backfill their [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=972.0999999999999s)]
*  pipeline because, you know, you know, it does beg a question of what they're going to do with [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=981.62s)]
*  their own internal R&D resources because they've really I think they can probably put those those [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=986.18s)]
*  functions on a diet in some some regards. I don't see the productivity of the yield coming from [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=992.3399999999999s)]
*  those areas. But yeah, I think that's going to be part of the playbook. I think, you know, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=999.38s)]
*  ultimately, Shanghai, the Shanghai hub will be added in the same breath as San Diego, San Francisco [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1004.02s)]
*  and Boston. You know, I went out like I said earlier, when I was in Suzhou, I was it had the [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1014.18s)]
*  same kind of feel and energy is walking around Cambridge, you know, you couldn't step anywhere [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1020.82s)]
*  without going crushing the molecule. So I do think it offers, you know, I think what you're [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1026.58s)]
*  going to get to is, you know, historically, the Chinese companies have been more of a [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1036.26s)]
*  a fast follower, I think. And, and I think people have been feeling very comfortable with them in [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1044.26s)]
*  that row. But it's I think it's still ultimately causing a problem with the [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1052.42s)]
*  as far as supply and demand is concerned. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1062.5s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Well, and I'm glad you mentioned the patent cliff, because I think that has to be [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1066.1000000000001s)]
*  at least part of the reason why some of these deals are getting done, right? We have a kind of [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1072.02s)]
*  not since what 2007 or 2010, you know, a pretty substantial patent cliff for a lot of big pharma [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1078.1s)]
*  companies coming in the next couple of years, right? Oh, no, indeed. And that's been the [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1088.5s)]
*  speculation that these guys have a pile of cash, and they'll be doing deals. And it hasn't [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1094.6599999999999s)]
*  necessarily played out that way right now. And people are scratching their heads. And that's [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1100.98s)]
*  probably for a separate discussion. But the IPO market isn't working, the M&A market isn't working. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1107.7s)]
*  You know, it's causing a little bit of consternation in the marketplace. And I think this [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1113.94s)]
*  this dynamic too, it allows companies rather than buying companies, right? Rather than buying a cow, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1119.22s)]
*  you can go buy you can go go go to China and buy the steak. So yeah, it does give it does give [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1126.9s)]
*  people options. But you know, you have to ask yourself, is this kind of can potentially, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1134.42s)]
*  not only is it redirecting resources out of the United States, but are we potentially also [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1139.8600000000001s)]
*  cannibalizing a little bit of the M&A dynamic that we've that's kind of been important pillar [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1146.3400000000001s)]
*  in how the capital markets for biopharmaceuticals work? Yeah, well, Alan, I'm going to have you back [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1153.54s)]
*  on. And we'll dig into this issue of the broken IPO market and what companies can do. We'll save [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1159.62s)]
*  that for a future episode. Going back to China, are there specific drug types or therapeutic areas [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1167.2199999999998s)]
*  that companies are really looking to China for? And you know, we've already alluded to or discussed [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1175.62s)]
*  you know, the the PD ones and how effective Chinese biotech has gotten at developing those. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1184.18s)]
*  But what you know, what what else what other drug types are and maybe it's not a specific one or two, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1192.1s)]
*  maybe it's it's all across the map. I'm not sure. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1199.3s)]
*  No, it's it's it's interesting to see how where they're really carving out their differentiation [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1203.54s)]
*  and being competitive. And, you know, I think people ask, are they are they really being [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1211.3s)]
*  bio betters? Or are they innovating? And I think the general perspective has been that they've been [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1219.86s)]
*  kind of me too. So me betters is what I've heard a lot of people he talked about. But they've been [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1226.6599999999999s)]
*  doing that so well and so prolifically now that, you know, you're seeing competition [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1232.74s)]
*  coming out of the woodwork. And people are being blindsided, you really I think it undermines the [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1241.86s)]
*  confidence of when you do a review of the competitive landscape, and having conviction that, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1249.54s)]
*  you know, you've got your you've got your arms around it, because there is so much of that [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1255.54s)]
*  going on over there. But I do think the innovation is bubbling under the surface. You know, I recently [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1262.82s)]
*  was advised that based on the number of patents that have been issued or filed, China is actually [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1270.5s)]
*  kicking our butts. Really? Yeah. So the innovation is bubbling under the surface. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1280.74s)]
*  So while today they're they're known as innovators, and I think we've still got an innovative heads up [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1287.06s)]
*  on them. They are they are catching up very wise very quickly. And to your question, you know, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1293.22s)]
*  they've proven themselves to be very, very good at making antibodies. They've been made able to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1299.54s)]
*  make the ADCs, which have been very that have been selling like hotcakes. Yeah, not an easy [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1307.7s)]
*  product to make either. No. So they've really been able to do a good job on those. I understand, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1313.46s)]
*  you know, they've doing a good job on by specific. So they've got the antibodies down. And I think [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1322.66s)]
*  they've gotten and they've gotten everybody's attention on that. But they're also, you know, [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1329.7s)]
*  the chemists are very good, too. So, you know, they got they can certainly go toe to toe with [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1334.74s)]
*  anybody on small molecules. And I think that's really where the general focus is. They haven't [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1340.42s)]
*  been as prolific in the cell that I've seen in the cell or gene therapy space. And I think that's [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1348.02s)]
*  also very costly modality. And, you know, that's not the way their their their medical system [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1354.42s)]
*  operates. But I think that I think it's those two particular modalities that they've done really [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1360.98s)]
*  well. And typically what they do is they tweak the chemistry and they enhance efficacy a little bit [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1368.18s)]
*  and improve safety profiles rather than doing traditionally doing the innovative first move of [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1372.98s)]
*  drugs. But as I said, you know, they are they are they are moving forward. And I think we got to [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1380.18s)]
*  take them seriously. Yeah, because I think they can create and they are creating dislocation in [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1390.74s)]
*  the system that that we've previously understood. Right. Art. And, you know, we we've been talking [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1398.34s)]
*  about this question of innovation, which you're saying is bubbling up versus kind of the refining [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1406.4199999999998s)]
*  of existing drugs incrementally improving existing drugs. Do you anticipate Chinese, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1413.62s)]
*  you know, the emergence of a big of a Chinese big pharma that is doing more global trials, [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1423.4599999999998s)]
*  bringing more products into the U.S. that, you know, were originated in China and maybe initially [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1431.06s)]
*  studied with, you know, a phase three or maybe two and three conducted as part of a global trial [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1437.94s)]
*  system in the U.S. and then approved in the U.S. I mean, are are we still a ways away from that or [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1445.3s)]
*  is that on the near horizon? And I think the U.S. represents a big market. So I think naturally [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1451.14s)]
*  it would it would make sense for companies to do that. Certainly some have. Yeah. Yeah. I think it [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1459.7s)]
*  has been done. And I think there are smaller companies that are that are migrating over one [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1467.7s)]
*  of the more successful IPOs this year. Ascentage is basically a company that's come from over there [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1472.26s)]
*  and they're they're executing very well. So I think you're going to see you're going to see that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1478.8200000000002s)]
*  There's no no question about it particularly. And I think part of what will influence that, too, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1485.22s)]
*  is how their capital market system works. You know, there was a period of time where [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1491.46s)]
*  if you know you had a choice, I was involved with one of those companies. You could go. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1496.66s)]
*  I remember when I got involved, I said, are we looking east or we look in west? [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1501.7s)]
*  Right now, I think you can only look west. But, you know, the western model is, like we've said, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1507.3s)]
*  has its own issues, but it's it's still looking better than the others. And I think the one thing [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1512.8200000000002s)]
*  that we have here in the United States, and this is one we have to be careful about, is we have the [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1519.46s)]
*  ecosystem. We've created a really, really robust ecosystem and it's the envy of the world. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1524.26s)]
*  You know, that's why you got a lot of European companies, a lot of companies out of Israel. You [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1533.14s)]
*  have companies from Asia who come in over here not only for our capital markets, but it's for our [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1537.62s)]
*  infrastructure. And China is certainly, you know, may, you know, may ultimately come to a point where [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1543.62s)]
*  people find that to be a fertile place to go to. And I think it has its purpose. But right now, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1552.42s)]
*  the capital markets, they doesn't have the complete ecosystem. So I still think we have a leg up, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1559.54s)]
*  but I think we also should not take our system for granted. And I think there's a high risk [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1566.5800000000002s)]
*  of that. I mean, the, you know, you know, I think what's going on today, you know, unlike [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1575.7s)]
*  when the Russians put rockets in space, and that kind of was a wake up call to the US [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1585.38s)]
*  to kind of harness our technology. And then we had the so called space race that JFK initiated. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1592.18s)]
*  At this point in time, when we're basically getting a shot across our bow, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1599.22s)]
*  that China is a real emerging biotech competitor for leadership, our response is to blow up the NIH. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1604.02s)]
*  It's a bit ironic. And, you know, we and you know, I think there's an opportunity for course [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1615.6200000000001s)]
*  correction. But you know, we should just take it for granted. Yeah, that's a that's a great point. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1621.54s)]
*  And I did want to ask you, you know, how you think some of those US policies, NIH funding cuts, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1628.66s)]
*  tariffs, you know, alter the competitive landscape, I was speaking to a gentleman who [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1636.5s)]
*  has a really interesting book coming out in late April called So Small, it's about it's a history [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1643.6200000000001s)]
*  of germ theory. And he is the head of science writing at MIT is a professor there, but also an [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1651.22s)]
*  author. And he what he was telling me is that when you stop funding, you know, something like [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1657.3s)]
*  the NIH freeze research grants, even for six months, you know, much less like a four year [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1663.78s)]
*  period, potentially, you you don't just pick up where you left off, you actually really lose [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1670.26s)]
*  some, you know, some not just people and programs, but also just knowledge. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1680.8200000000002s)]
*  You know, he referenced, you know, in the lab that, you know, the single guy who knows to [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1687.3s)]
*  knock twice on the side of the, you know, the machine to make it work right, who once he's gone, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1691.6200000000001s)]
*  you know, no one no one knows how to do that. And you just say the knowledge is lost. And he was, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1696.8200000000002s)]
*  he was quite concerned about that. But in any way, Alan, you know, what do you think some of these [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1702.74s)]
*  US policies might do to, you know, affect the competitive landscape? [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1707.46s)]
*  You know, I think long term, you know, you can't measure the [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1715.8600000000001s)]
*  near term implications of doing something at the NIH, because it, you know, the cause of the lead [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1719.78s)]
*  time of development and their impact is usually felt, you know, a generation later. Yeah. So it's, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1726.1000000000001s)]
*  you know, it's one of those things that you can do for short term gratification, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1733.9399999999998s)]
*  you know, I, you know, and, and I think as a general premise, you know, all this funding [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1738.1s)]
*  has kind of become like an entitlement and people have viewed these things as entitlements. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1744.6599999999999s)]
*  And that's not a good thing either. Right. So, you know, I think, you know, doing something that's a [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1750.26s)]
*  little bit more freestanding and challenging the status quo of how we allocate resources, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1756.02s)]
*  I think makes infinite sense if it's done in rational, thoughtful manner, you know, I mean, [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1761.94s)]
*  I kind of hate to think how much money the government has spent on supporting the amyloid [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1768.98s)]
*  plaque hypothesis. I mean, I'm sure there's small fortune was there. So, you know, we got to be [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1775.7s)]
*  thoughtful about how we do things. But I think those are longer term implications. You know, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1784.9s)]
*  I think stuff that can have bigger implications are things that kind of view [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1790.6599999999999s)]
*  things that put barriers around global medicine. You know, it's global medicine. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1798.74s)]
*  You know, this is about humanity. And, you know, trying to kind of artificially [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1806.02s)]
*  tether that to geographical boundaries seems a bit unnatural in the spirit of helping mankind. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1812.66s)]
*  So, you know, to me, the Biosecure Act didn't make a lot of sense. It seemed to be highly [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1824.58s)]
*  disruptive. It's adding costs and delays, arguably, to bring in drugs to market as opposed to helping [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1830.34s)]
*  people do that. You know, if there's disrespect on on respecting IP, you know, that's a different [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1836.5s)]
*  issue and you need to address it differently. But so from my perspective, I think the lot of [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1846.34s)]
*  these policies are not particularly helpful. But I guess it's through the eyes of the beholder and [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1854.02s)]
*  what you're trying to solve for. You know, you're trying if this is all about patience. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1861.54s)]
*  And I've always thought that, you know, at the end of the day, why a lot of people make money on this [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1866.34s)]
*  and it is a profitable way of doing so. I thought this was still all about patience and about, you [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1871.06s)]
*  know, if you do the right thing for patients, everything else takes care of itself. And somehow, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1878.98s)]
*  we get that that's getting lost in translation when it comes down to that. I think as an industry, [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1885.54s)]
*  we can do a much better job in terms of resource allocation. I mean, you know, how do you get 100 [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1892.9s)]
*  car TCD 19 companies, you know, look at what's going on in obesity right now to actually somewhat [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1898.66s)]
*  obese. Obese pipelines. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, you know, we have to be smarter about how we allocate. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1904.98s)]
*  It's such a lemming approach. You know, why do we need so many checkpoint PDL ones out there? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1915.7s)]
*  You know, we all we're doing is actually commoditizing good science. And so, you know, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1922.74s)]
*  we sow the seeds to a lot of these problems. And, you know, and it's, you know, you have to [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1928.9s)]
*  ask yourself who wrote the check for that hundred CD 19 company? Who thought that was a good idea? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1934.66s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Right. Well, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1941.3000000000002s)]
*  tariffs, Peter Navarro, saber rattling aside, what are the potential downsides, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1947.14s)]
*  if there are any of China's growing role in biotech, particularly for US and European companies? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1955.62s)]
*  You know, the biggest concern is is China's ability to produce high quality drugs at lower costs, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1966.26s)]
*  which can really disrupt the financing models here in the US and Europe as we've touched on, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1972.58s)]
*  you know, their ability to do that kind of as we touched on, I think, really put the M&A market [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1979.62s)]
*  at at risk. And, you know, it's going to put more pressure on companies to actually launch [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1986.34s)]
*  their own products, commercialize their own products. And, you know, I think it does challenge [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1992.18s)]
*  one of the underpinnings of the of how the capital markets currently work, you know, M&A [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=1999.7s)]
*  has been a big driver of returns. And I've and I've actually written an article in the past saying [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2007.1399999999999s)]
*  that at times when the markets been hot, it's almost akin to a casino mentality, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2013.7s)]
*  as far as who people think is going to be the next takeout. I mean, [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2019.46s)]
*  so, you know, people have companies circled up. So if you're if there are things that are playing [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2025.3s)]
*  out as a consequence of China's emergence, that's kind of giving people an alternative to that [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2030.26s)]
*  channel. You know, that's going to have its implications at the end of the day. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2037.78s)]
*  Yeah, there's there's no I don't see any getting around that. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2042.66s)]
*  And and it's also going to hit the valuations of companies and have their cost of capital, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2049.54s)]
*  because if they're basically re resetting the prices, not only for drug prices that are [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2054.9s)]
*  commercial, but what are the trade values of a phase one asset or a phase two asset, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2062.02s)]
*  you know, your valuations are going to be impacted, too. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2068.5s)]
*  So, you know, there's a ripple effect. You know, yeah, I wouldn't call them the drunks that came [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2074.2599999999998s)]
*  to the party. But it has that kind of potential implication on on the way the model has has [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2079.62s)]
*  traditionally worked. You know, certainly, I think the me too is going to kind of make things [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2087.06s)]
*  branded products become almost generic before their time. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2095.2999999999997s)]
*  Now, I think it'll give a new meaning to branded generic in certain respects. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2101.14s)]
*  When from a national security perspective, you know, concerns persist around the IP [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2112.1s)]
*  protection and over reliance on Chinese supply lines. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2117.22s)]
*  I'm so, you know, going back to what I said, I, you know, I don't want to poo poo them. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2120.66s)]
*  But I think in the context of what you're saw trying to solve for address, it's a little bit [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2126.98s)]
*  of the tail wagging the dog. And I would suggest that there's different ways to try to mitigate [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2132.98s)]
*  those risks. But you know, the whole thing, so many people work with Woozy and you know, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2139.06s)]
*  Woozy may have, you know, be having data that may be ultimately very competitive somewhere down the [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2145.54s)]
*  road. And, you know, I guess that's a business decision. And, you know, I think you can make [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2151.94s)]
*  decision on that. But I think there's other other Chinese suppliers, you don't have to work with [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2157.78s)]
*  Woozy. Yeah, as well. So, you know, if these trains, these trends continue, they could certainly, [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2161.94s)]
*  they are reshaping the competitive landscape and do pose long term challenges. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2170.1s)]
*  I don't think people really want to think about it, but it's here, it's now. And, and it's, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2177.06s)]
*  and it's not going away. And as I understand it, the US government's actually going to be putting [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2183.46s)]
*  out a paper in the first week in April, that's going to be talking a little bit more about this. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2188.74s)]
*  So it'll be really, it'll be interesting guys. When I was at the Calend conference, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2194.66s)]
*  not that long ago, they had a couple of representatives, and there was actually a [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2199.62s)]
*  subcommittee appointed by the Senate, looking at biotech innovation. So they were trying to tie [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2204.02s)]
*  this in. And but it seems to me, the bigger issue is that they're working on on executive order, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2210.1s)]
*  expansion of powers, and overspending. And I think that this is where this is all going to kind of [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2219.46s)]
*  rub against the road. Okay, so you've, you've talked about additional risk associated with [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2226.02s)]
*  Chinese biotech based on, you know, some of the existing economic models in US and Europe. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2232.82s)]
*  But what about for patients is because, you know, one of the whole cases, you know, that Eli Lilly [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2240.34s)]
*  was making with their PD want PDL PD one back in 2022, that was ultimately declined by the FDA, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2246.74s)]
*  was that it would be, you know, they'd offer it at something like a 40% discount to the other [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2255.7s)]
*  immune cancer immunotherapies that were on the market at the time. And I remember [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2261.94s)]
*  Richard Paster saying, well, you know, FDA doesn't consider costs. But I think people heard that and [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2268.2599999999998s)]
*  thought, well, you know, if we can get this, you know, bio better, essentially, or, you know, some [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2274.18s)]
*  sort of equal cancer product at a much at a much lower cost, wouldn't that be good for patients? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2281.06s)]
*  What do you think about that? Is, you know, do you think Chinese biotech's presence and the growth [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2288.1s)]
*  of Chinese biotech is ultimately good or ultimately bad for patients? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2294.58s)]
*  You know, I think I think it in the short term, China's growing biotech presence, I think, is [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2300.9s)]
*  great for patients. You know, I think it'll bring down costs and make drugs much cheaper [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2310.34s)]
*  and lead to better access over in the short term. However, the long term picture is a lot more [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2316.1000000000004s)]
*  complex. If traditional biotech funding models break down, incentives for high risk, high reward [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2323.3s)]
*  innovation can diminish. This may result in fewer first in class breakthroughs and more incremental [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2330.98s)]
*  improvements, potentially slowing the pace of medical advancement. You know, we you know, we, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2337.22s)]
*  you know, I think our risk reward model works pretty well. And I think it's been become the envy [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2343.2999999999997s)]
*  of the world and China's doing a really good job of emulating it. You know, are there things that [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2349.9399999999996s)]
*  we can do better and more efficiently? Absolutely. But, you know, I think you got to be careful what [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2355.14s)]
*  you wish for. You know, if you start if you start it's like the sweater, the loose thread on a [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2366.1s)]
*  sweater. Once you start pulling on that, you know, who knows where that thing is going to go. So, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2373.22s)]
*  you know, it's we do need to think about how we squeeze do things more efficiently. You know, [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2379.7799999999997s)]
*  and I think, you know, I think clinical development is a ripe area to take a fresh look at. You know, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2386.1s)]
*  we should also look at, you know, questioning, you know, how preclinical work and you know, the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2392.58s)]
*  whether or not there's opportunities to squeeze time out of that. You know, they can really get [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2398.02s)]
*  drugs to market in half the time we do, you know, and there's trade offs, obviously, there's risks. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2403.86s)]
*  And, you know, there's a fundamental view is, you know, you're trying to identify things that [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2411.46s)]
*  are just safe. And then you can try to figure out things whether they work later on. So there's [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2415.62s)]
*  different there's different fundamental approaches. But I think at the end of the day, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2421.94s)]
*  this is a real opportunity for us to kind of look at ourselves, take stock and understand what we're [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2427.06s)]
*  doing good and what we're not doing good. And even on a bigger picture, while everybody's quite [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2434.5s)]
*  anxious over the new head of HS, as what might actually happen, and for good reason. But I would [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2439.78s)]
*  also say that when you spend $4 trillion a year on health care, and you have the highest cost per [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2449.78s)]
*  capita in the free world, yet you have the lowest life expectancy in the free world, that we're in [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2455.7000000000003s)]
*  fact paying more for less, you know, there's probably opportunities in a lot of areas for us [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2462.42s)]
*  to be more efficient on how we do that. Yeah, something's amiss. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2467.7000000000003s)]
*  So do you do you think that, you know, we talked about a shot across the bow, and we're kind of [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2475.06s)]
*  retrenching here at the moment. Do you think that we'll see a shift in global biotech leadership [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2483.86s)]
*  away from the US given China's rise? Are we getting to that point or not yet? [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2492.6600000000003s)]
*  You know, I've thought about that a lot. And I think at this point, I think it's, it's, it's [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2498.7400000000002s)]
*  pretty safe to say that we're still there. You know, I think we're still innovating, I think that [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2506.02s)]
*  breakthroughs and what we're seeing, you know, speak for themselves. But I don't think, you know, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2511.94s)]
*  you got to also look at what happened to the dinosaur at the at the end of the day. And you [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2520.1000000000004s)]
*  can't rest on your laurels. The fact that they're out patterning us right now, you know, it could [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2526.6600000000003s)]
*  be a bunch of crap that they're thrown over the wall, I have no idea what they're filing. But [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2531.78s)]
*  the fact that they're, they're close on an absolute number basis or beating us on an [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2537.7000000000003s)]
*  absolute number basis does suggest that the that should serve as a wake up call. If we continue to [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2542.7400000000002s)]
*  maintain our leadership, you know, you know, it's like the hair and the and the [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2550.26s)]
*  and the mouse, whatever it was, the tortoise, you know, if we if we take too many naps along the way, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2557.1400000000003s)]
*  you know, those guys will get to us. So so no, I think I think this should be this should serve [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2565.6200000000003s)]
*  as a wake up call. And that's why I think it's so ironic that, you know, really, right now, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2573.6200000000003s)]
*  the actions that we've taken has been anything but the has been the antithesis of a wake up call, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2579.14s)]
*  which I think is frustrating and scaring a lot of folks. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2584.58s)]
*  So Alan, where do we go from here? You know, what what should we be thinking about? And I guess the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2589.7799999999997s)]
*  short to mid term? What should we you know, cross our fingers about? What what should we [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2596.8199999999997s)]
*  keep an eye out for? You know, what where are we headed? Do we does the industry have the collective [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2602.5s)]
*  will to make the adjustments and see this as an opportunity to compete, you know, to to up our game? [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2608.66s)]
*  You know, policy makers, investors, and bio pharmaceutical leaders must take proactive steps [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2618.8199999999997s)]
*  at this time to ensure innovation remains incentivized while strategically leveraging [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2628.1s)]
*  China's efficiencies. China's biotech emergence isn't a future trend. It's here. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2634.02s)]
*  Whether it's an opportunity or a challenge depends on how the industry people adapt. The race for [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2640.74s)]
*  innovation is on. And the next decade will determine who leads next wave of medical breakthroughs. [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2647.2999999999997s)]
*  So, you know, I would say right now it's a coin toss, but I think there's still [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2653.62s)]
*  great opportunity for us to grab the bull by the horns. And I think if you look at America, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2658.8199999999997s)]
*  every time it is confronted with a challenge, you know, we we know how to innovate, we know how to [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2664.8199999999997s)]
*  pivot, and we know how to rationalize things. And, you know, certainly, I think the current current [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2670.8199999999997s)]
*  leadership is not accepting status quo. So on one hand, you know, if you're looking at [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2677.3s)]
*  efficiencies that may be gained from the clinical side, FDA, this might represent a unique [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2684.42s)]
*  opportunity to take a freestanding approach to see if some of those practices can be shed [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2691.46s)]
*  and be more more more efficient. On the other hand, you know, similar people are making decisions to [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2696.82s)]
*  blow up NIH, which I think may get you a tax cut this year, but I'm not sure what it'll do, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2705.7s)]
*  you know, 10 years from now. So, you know, again, I think you got to be careful what you wish for. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2713.8599999999997s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Well, I think that is a nice positive and yet nuanced note for us to end on, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2719.54s)]
*  Alan. We've been speaking with with Alan Shaw, biotech soothsayer and longtime friend of this [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rjc66I_Mfwk&t=2728.26s)]
