Video Description: When Tuyen Ong was a child, he and his family escaped Vietnam by boat in the dead of the night, bound for an Indonesian refugee camp. They spent a year in that camp before emigrating to the U.K., where Ong’s underprivileged adolescence found him growing up in the projects of London. Against the odds, Ong worked his way to UCL for an education that culminated with an M.D. Today, he’s CEO of Ring Therapeutics, a promising emerging biotech backed by Flagship Pioneering, the kingmaker behind the rise of Moderna. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Ong shares on his challenging formative years, the unspoken love between a father and son, facing down racism as a poor Chinese kid in Vietnam and London, and how those experiences shape his leadership at Ring. Oh, and we talk about some pretty cool science, too.

# Commensal Virus Vectors With Ring Therapeutics' Tuyen Ong, M.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [April 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y)
*  I would imagine there's a certain air of confidence that comes with counting yourself among the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  bio pharma companies in the flagship pioneering stable. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=9.42s)]
*  Flagship is the builder of biotechs that played a lead hand in assembling a whopper [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=14.72s)]
*  in Moderna. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=19.68s)]
*  I don't know that the leaders over at Flagship would embrace the word kingmakers, but when [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=20.68s)]
*  you build a Moderna from zero to approval of one of the most important vaccines in history [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=25.18s)]
*  in just about a decade, people are going to talk. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=31.7s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=35.54s)]
*  This is the business of biotech and my guest on today's show is CEO of fellow Flagship [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=36.7s)]
*  pioneering company Ring Therapeutics. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=42.66s)]
*  Ring is leveraging the human commensal virome to deliver redosable and targetable gene therapy [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=46.7s)]
*  in a way that we haven't seen before. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=52.3s)]
*  It's developing human and lo viruses as a new class of gene therapy vector, building [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=54.82s)]
*  on their potential to overcome some of the challenges that have vexed gene therapy developers, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=60.36s)]
*  those challenges, including tropism, safety, immunogenicity, and redosing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=65.02s)]
*  Ring is a unique company with a unique leader. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=71.58s)]
*  His story of resilience and odds beating began when he was a child, and we'll explore that [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  story on today's episode. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=79.32s)]
*  Suffice it to say those who knew his early circumstances as a Vietnamese refugee probably [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=81.7s)]
*  wouldn't have placed their bets on Dr. Ong earning a UCL MD and quickly climbing the [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=86.54s)]
*  ranks at Pfizer, Bausch and Lomb, PTC Therapeutics, and Biogen before leading a promising and [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=92.68s)]
*  well-funded emerging biotech. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  But Tuan Ong did just that, and he's here with us today to talk about it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=101.38s)]
*  Dr. Ong, welcome to the show. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=105.58s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=107.18s)]
*  Thanks for inviting me. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=108.18s)]
*  It's my pleasure. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=109.94s)]
*  And I want to start kind of where we are today and work backwards a little bit. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=112.06s)]
*  So you're CEO of Ring Therapeutics. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=116.69999999999999s)]
*  As I mentioned, you also hold the title of CEO partner at Flagship Pioneering, meaning [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  you're one of the flagship pioneering, head of one of the flagship pioneering companies. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=124.86s)]
*  The VC that famously gave Moderna its start and which led your $117 million Series B last [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=131.1s)]
*  summer. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=137.78s)]
*  I want you to sort of frame that up for us, clear it up for me how that came to pass, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=138.94s)]
*  how you came to become CEO at Ring. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=143.22s)]
*  Thanks again for the invitation, Matt. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=146.66s)]
*  Maybe if I can start off with just an introduction about Ring. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=149.38s)]
*  So as you mentioned, Ring was founded by Flagship Pioneering and really came out of Flagship [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=152.74s)]
*  Labs through an exploration on the human virus. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=157.18s)]
*  So what we essentially asked was, what if there are viruses that live in and amongst [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=160.98s)]
*  us that don't cause disease? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=165.42000000000002s)]
*  Do they essentially exist? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=167.5s)]
*  And can we essentially harness them for delivering therapeutics? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=169.5s)]
*  It turns out that there's a family of viruses that are commensal. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  These have co-evolved with us over millions of years and really established specific traits [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=179.22s)]
*  in regards to specific tissue tropism, as well as the ability to evade immune systems [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=184.14s)]
*  and making them the ideal vector. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=189.22s)]
*  And so through my journey as a drug developer in the gene therapy space, it can be somewhat [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=191.7s)]
*  frustrating, given some of the limitations and setbacks we've had in gene therapy. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=198.78s)]
*  And so when I heard about Ring therapeutics, I just instantly knew that this could potentially [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=204.46s)]
*  be transformative in so many ways that we've never fought before in the gene therapy space. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=210.46s)]
*  And you joined the company when? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=218.34s)]
*  I joined in September 2020. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=220.1s)]
*  2020, OK. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=222.5s)]
*  So if I'm looking at the time frame correctly here, and I'm curious, this is kind of off [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=223.5s)]
*  the cuff question, but as I alluded to the fact that Flagship Pioneering had a big hand [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=228.54s)]
*  in the success of Moderna. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=233.78s)]
*  Moderna was a 2010, I think, founding? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=236.18s)]
*  2011, if I recall. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=239.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=241.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=241.57999999999998s)]
*  So 2011, you ring 2017? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=242.74s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=246.1s)]
*  And then you jump on board in 2020. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=247.74s)]
*  So be honest with me here, Twan. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=249.58s)]
*  Is there any sense of when Flagship has one of its children go ballistic the way that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=251.3s)]
*  Moderna did? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  How does that set the mood? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=260.62s)]
*  Is there any sense of new pressure? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  What does it kind of feel like as one of the companies under the Flagship umbrella? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=266.1s)]
*  Yeah, I think within the ecosystem, we call them our sister companies. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=270.62s)]
*  And so obviously, it inspires us. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=276.38s)]
*  I think there's a great deal of respect in terms of what Moderna has achieved. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=278.78s)]
*  I think more importantly, we all work in this field really to innovate therapeutics for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=282.97999999999996s)]
*  patients, right? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=288.26s)]
*  Given the pandemic, I think there's a huge sense of admiration in terms of what Moderna [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=289.5s)]
*  has achieved. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=293.5s)]
*  I mean, that has only kind of garnered additional drive for us to do the same in a meaningful [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=294.5s)]
*  way in the gene therapy space. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  So it does set up a high bar for us. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=303.02s)]
*  It does kind of create that sort of competition amongst the ecosystem companies, which again, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=305.98s)]
*  I think we thrive under and definitely kind of creates the passion and energy within Ring [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=310.3s)]
*  to again achieve what our sister company at Moderna have done. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=314.9s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=318.74s)]
*  Well, it's a great company to be in. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=319.74s)]
*  Good elbows to rub for sure. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=321.14s)]
*  So getting back to you, you're a University of College London MD and your early experience [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=324.06s)]
*  coming out of school was on the clinical and medical operations side. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=329.18s)]
*  And then as I mentioned in my intro, you moved into some pretty significant and important [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=333.58s)]
*  positions in big pharma and eventually to business development. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=339.14s)]
*  So tell us about that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=343.18s)]
*  What inspired that transition toward kind of the business development side of biopharma? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=344.94s)]
*  Yeah, it's a good question. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=350.62s)]
*  I think when you think about it, sometimes it's not obvious, right? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=352.5s)]
*  And I think Steve Jobs once said, sometimes to connect the thoughts, you've got to look [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=356.62s)]
*  backwards. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=362.06s)]
*  I think when I kind of think about my life and my career, I think the main sort of dots [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=363.54s)]
*  were first an interest in science. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=367.66s)]
*  I think as a kid, I used to sort of take things apart and try to kind of reassemble them and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=371.38s)]
*  figure out how they worked. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=376.74s)]
*  And so I just loved science and that perspective that ultimately led me to studying medicine [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=377.74s)]
*  and being a doctor, really a game with the hope at the time of making an impact to patients. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=384.42s)]
*  And so I was fortunate enough to have a clinical career and ultimately move into the biotech [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=389.86s)]
*  industry. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=395.18s)]
*  I think again, kind of just in hindsight, there was a entrepreneurial spirit within [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=396.18s)]
*  me that I didn't really realize I had as a physician, but ultimately obviously kind of [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=402.22s)]
*  came out in kind of greater force. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=407.82s)]
*  And then also the realization that really to drive innovation and drive the direction [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=411.5s)]
*  of innovation, that whole business development piece really is a significant factor of what [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=415.14s)]
*  we do. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=420.46s)]
*  And so being a life learner, I had the opportunity to pursue an MBA just around of my MD. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=421.46s)]
*  And again, kind of which ultimately led me to position that I'm currently in. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=427.3s)]
*  So very fortunate when I look back in hindsight. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=430.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=434.62s)]
*  Take us back to that sort of transitionary period when you realized and decided to scratch [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=435.62s)]
*  that entrepreneurial itch. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=443.06s)]
*  Was there fear? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=445.38s)]
*  Was there any sense of trepidation or risk aversion associated with that move? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=446.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=451.94s)]
*  I think, you know, just again, we'll probably dig into my background, but, you know, for [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=453.82s)]
*  me studying medicine and becoming a doctor was a lifelong dream, right? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=459.86s)]
*  As you point out early on, it was never on the cards for someone like me to become a [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=465.78000000000003s)]
*  doctor. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=471.06s)]
*  And so for me, the moment that I decided to leave essentially medicine and go into industry, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=473.29999999999995s)]
*  I think my parents almost cried. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=479.06s)]
*  My parents probably realized finally, you know, our second generation has actually made [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=481.58s)]
*  it. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=486.53999999999996s)]
*  We've had challenges along the way. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=487.53999999999996s)]
*  And now you're basically jeopardizing all of that. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=489.26s)]
*  But for me, it was always, I think I've been somewhat of a risk taker in life. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=493.58s)]
*  I think I've had somewhat sort of the courage to be able to pursue my own sort of dreams. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  And I think kind of looking at it in hindsight, I've been extremely lucky that it all turned [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=505.09999999999997s)]
*  out extremely well in a way that I love doing what I do. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=509.53999999999996s)]
*  And it's such a meaningful profession of what we do essentially of developing drugs for [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=513.98s)]
*  patients. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=518.06s)]
*  So not easy along the way. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=519.06s)]
*  But again, I think I feel fortunate of kind of landing where I am today. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=520.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=525.66s)]
*  I mean, the other element of risk that strikes me is, as I mentioned, you work for some very [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  significant companies and you had some significant roles within those companies. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=531.9s)]
*  And those are roles where, you know, those roles came with, I'm sure, a nice, comfortable, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=536.26s)]
*  secure paycheck, a nice benefits package and a nice office. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=543.26s)]
*  You could probably stay as long as you wanted to, but there's some degree of risk in leaving [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=547.3s)]
*  that big firm. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=551.9399999999999s)]
*  You can, to some degree, affect change and develop medicines in those positions as well. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=553.1s)]
*  But what was the, I guess, appeal of taking the reins at a smaller, more nimble, emerging [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=558.9000000000001s)]
*  biopharma company as opposed to remaining in a more comfortable and safe position in [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=567.2600000000001s)]
*  big bio? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=573.2600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think I've had some incredible memories of being at Pfizer, you know, Bausch [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=574.2600000000001s)]
*  and I've made lifelong friendships. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=582.46s)]
*  And so I've learned a great deal. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=585.86s)]
*  And I think everything I've learned along the way has helped me become the leader I [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=587.62s)]
*  have been in the biotech startup world. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=591.6600000000001s)]
*  For me, there's nothing more satisfying than actually building something from the ground [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=595.94s)]
*  upwards. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  I think the life sciences does allow those that are courageous enough to essentially [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  be able to pioneer into spaces and to be able to rewrite ways of doing it. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=605.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=611.62s)]
*  Just for example, I just kind of remember when I was at NightScar, my first week, I [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=612.62s)]
*  was preparing for an IPO roadshow and then I was also ordering power tools from Amazon [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=618.58s)]
*  to assemble my office desk. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=625.46s)]
*  There's no facilities hotline. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=628.2600000000001s)]
*  There's no ticket. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=631.7s)]
*  You sort of submit to get somebody to build this. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=632.7s)]
*  It's you and you just got to do it. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=635.8199999999999s)]
*  And I love that. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=639.4599999999999s)]
*  I think that's part of my sort of philosophy in life and my own sort of attitude, just [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=640.4599999999999s)]
*  go after it and do it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=645.26s)]
*  And so I think biotech really serves those that have that mindset really well. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=647.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=655.02s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=656.02s)]
*  Well, I can't have a conversation with you knowing a little bit about your background [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=657.02s)]
*  without digging into some of the foundational elements that make you who you are. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=660.62s)]
*  You know, we've ascertained that it wasn't written in the stars the day that Tuan Anh [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=667.42s)]
*  was born, that he was going to become an MD and lead an emerging biotech. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=674.0600000000001s)]
*  I spent a lot of time on this podcast and in my other job as a writer for Bioprocess [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=679.94s)]
*  online talking with people who, you know, maybe it wasn't written in the stars, but [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=685.5799999999999s)]
*  the pedigree was there. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=690.3399999999999s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=691.3399999999999s)]
*  Like they come from the family. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=692.3399999999999s)]
*  And I guess I would say it's not a particular surprise. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=696.54s)]
*  You mentioned your parents a minute ago. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=701.3s)]
*  I want to ask you about them. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=702.9399999999999s)]
*  So and kind of where they're where they came from and how they got you where you are today. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=704.2199999999999s)]
*  So first, tell me about your parents. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=711.14s)]
*  You know, you said your parents almost cried when you left when you quit practicing [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=713.42s)]
*  medicine and moved into industry. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=717.34s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=719.78s)]
*  I come from sort of Asian parents, right? [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=721.9s)]
*  My parents are Chinese. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=724.8199999999999s)]
*  I was born in Vietnam. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=728.14s)]
*  And as you mentioned, I was a refugee in the Vietnam War. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=729.54s)]
*  So my parents moved to, I guess, were born in Vietnam after my my grandfathers left. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=734.14s)]
*  And I guess he would probably be the first pioneer left about 16 during one of the Chinese [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=740.54s)]
*  families. Again, this is probably the beginning for our generation in Vietnam, where they [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=746.3399999999999s)]
*  you know, where he sort of fled and made a new life for himself. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=753.74s)]
*  And so I think when we had moved from Vietnam to London, you know, we we lived a life of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=757.18s)]
*  relative poverty. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=765.5s)]
*  I think I lived in the projects I lived and studied in one of the most deprived schools in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=766.94s)]
*  a city, London. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=772.98s)]
*  And so I think for us all refugees to potentially kind of see that way as escaping poverty [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=774.6600000000001s)]
*  and actually achieving stability, where again, during war, on Vietnam, you know, things were [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=782.1800000000001s)]
*  so hostile and unstable. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=789.82s)]
*  My parents basically decided to make the call that this it's now or never really. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=792.14s)]
*  So in the middle of the night, they decided to sort of smuggle us out under the cover of [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=797.66s)]
*  darkness onto a boat. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=801.82s)]
*  And, you know, we had nothing but the clothes on our backs and really a dream of a better [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=805.26s)]
*  life. It sounds kind of cliche, but we were fortunate to survive that. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=810.58s)]
*  We lived in the refugee camp for about a year in Indonesia, actually. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=814.62s)]
*  We lived in a refugee camp for a year before moving to London. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=821.1800000000001s)]
*  And I remember arriving and none of us could speak a word of English. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=825.78s)]
*  You know, we had to. And this was in the 80s where, you know, we had to endure racism. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=830.58s)]
*  I think the council apartment that I lived that already recorded the projects here in the [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=835.4200000000001s)]
*  U.S. were tough. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=840.34s)]
*  That there were drug addicts and drug dealers. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=844.5400000000001s)]
*  I remember running up from school through the stairwell just to avoid that, you know, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=847.9s)]
*  and it still haunts me when I sort of see faces of drug addicts from that sort of [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=852.38s)]
*  stairwell. And so there's an innate drive inside of you, I think. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=858.6999999999999s)]
*  I think there's an innate drive to be, you know, to be somebody. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=863.98s)]
*  And I think for me, you know, the first piece is as Asian parents, your parents never tell [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=868.4599999999999s)]
*  you they're proud of you. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=874.18s)]
*  No matter what you accomplish, even if you win a Nobel Prize, if you become president, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=875.8199999999999s)]
*  you know, you could have done better. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=879.62s)]
*  And so I think that's a reverse psychology that I've always had to deal with, whereby [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=881.66s)]
*  my parents have always driven me. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=885.62s)]
*  Not that I actually needed that drive, but I think I actually saw that hint in my dad's [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=887.9399999999999s)]
*  eye, despite not ever telling me that he was proud of me when I graduated at medical [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=894.78s)]
*  school, that there was that immense sense of pride. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=899.4599999999999s)]
*  And I think when I sort of told them that I'm leaving medicine to pursue a career in [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=903.2199999999999s)]
*  the pharmaceutical industry, you know, I exaggerated a little bit, but I think there was that, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=907.9799999999999s)]
*  you know, what have we done here now? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=914.06s)]
*  It's a big risk. This is an unknown. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=916.2199999999999s)]
*  And it's funny, you know, as you kind of grow older and you kind of have that conversation [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=918.9799999999999s)]
*  with, you know, your parents in an adult way. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=923.9s)]
*  You know, and I spoke to him sort of recently where, you know, he kind of was worrying how [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=928.3s)]
*  you said and parents again, the funny thing is they always offer you advice, no matter [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=933.3s)]
*  how old they are, right? [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=936.74s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=938.02s)]
*  Or how smart. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=940.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=942.18s)]
*  And, you know, my dad, bless his heart, is telling me about the FDA and how to get drugs [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=943.5s)]
*  approved, knowing that I work in this sort of field. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=949.78s)]
*  And I'm kind of, you know, and sort of just in a very kind of caring way. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=951.86s)]
*  And I got the sense through that conversation. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=956.4599999999999s)]
*  It was almost, you know, again, Asian parents will never kind of express that degree of [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=958.66s)]
*  emotion. But it's almost like you did well, son. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=963.38s)]
*  I'm glad I'm proud of what you've done. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=966.86s)]
*  And I'm really proud of what you're doing for society here. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=968.86s)]
*  So, you know, well done. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=972.5799999999999s)]
*  So that to me meant a lot. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=974.5s)]

*  Now, is the, I guess, reluctance to demonstrate affection reciprocal? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1016.3s)]
*  Because I'm wondering as you're talking, Dr. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1027.18s)]
*  Ong, I'm wondering if you turn to your dad and say, Dad, thanks for putting me in that boat. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1029.34s)]
*  I love you. Thanks for putting, you know, thanks for slipping out of there under the cover of darkness. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1034.7s)]
*  I know it was a tough road, but it was the right thing to do. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1039.4199999999998s)]
*  And the risk, I mean, it's, you know, the irony, if you will, of his risk aversion, given the fact [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1042.38s)]
*  that he took that risk, that your parents took that risk, it's not lost on me. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1050.0600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I think you'll see that a lot in sort of first generations of immigrants and refugees, right? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1054.7s)]
*  I think there is that somewhat, they've made, they've taken that big risk, but there's that [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1061.66s)]
*  need and yearning to have that stability and that stability for other generations. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1067.26s)]
*  And so it is an irony. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1071.9s)]
*  It's tough. I think as a parent now, I've become a lot sort of more open. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1075.74s)]
*  I tell Mike to the children, I love them all the time. I hug them. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1082.38s)]
*  It's a very different sort of culture. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1085.5s)]
*  And, you know, to your point, the really funny thing was, again, I was texting my dad. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1087.74s)]
*  Again, this was a while back and I've never, to your point, it sounds strange, but I've actually [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1092.8600000000001s)]
*  never told my dad I loved him. But then for one reason or another, and I think life is so short [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1097.26s)]
*  and precious, I texted back and I put, you know, I love you, dad. And so that was probably the first [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1103.98s)]
*  time I've ever told my dad that I loved him. But I felt it was important to do so just because, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1110.38s)]
*  you know, how fragile life is. And I think you never get that opportunity. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1115.98s)]
*  And so you don't want to regret not having a chance to say that. And so anyway, I did that. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1120.86s)]
*  Good. I'm glad you did that. And I'm sure it felt good. I'm sure it felt good to do that. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1127.18s)]
*  Oh, yeah, for sure it did. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1131.1s)]
*  Whether or not he ever chooses to admit it, it felt good for him to hear, I guarantee it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1132.3799999999999s)]
*  Tell me about the education, though. So, you know, you don't speak the language. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1139.1s)]
*  You're going to school, I'm assuming, like from the get go when you get to London, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1148.46s)]
*  probably maybe not, you know, you're not going to private school, I'm sure. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1151.98s)]
*  So tell me about your education, you know, early on and when you realized that not only, you know, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1156.86s)]
*  that you had both the interest in science, but also the ability, like, when did it strike you [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1166.3s)]
*  that, hey, you know, there's a future here beyond undergrad, beyond, you know, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1173.9s)]
*  there's an opportunity down the road for me to, you know, to make something in this. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1182.38s)]
*  Yeah, I think we, yeah, we moved to London, and I remember distinctly, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1185.98s)]
*  I learned to speak English with flashcards. And so these were magnetic flashcards, you would have [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1194.0600000000002s)]
*  this as a slide through a machine, and it would have a picture of a cat and it would go cat, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1199.5s)]
*  you know. And for me, I've always had that just natural curiosity. I've always been, as I mentioned, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1204.86s)]
*  a lifelong learner. I didn't realize this at the time, but I would take things apart at home [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1212.22s)]
*  and try to kind of whether it's just a ballpoint pen and trying to take it apart and sort of figure [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1218.7s)]
*  out, you know, one, how it works or trying whether I can sort of reinvent something with it. I think [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1222.46s)]
*  really that led to, again, an interest in science. And as I sort of started learning more about [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1228.54s)]
*  science and I started reading more about it, I think I just had this sort of innate sort of [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1235.8999999999999s)]
*  understanding around, you know, around sort of biology, the world around us. And so I was [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1242.7s)]
*  relatively quiet as a kid, where in classes, you know, when questions were asked, I always knew the [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1248.46s)]
*  answer and never kind of put my hand up. And I think the teachers started noticing and every time [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1256.54s)]
*  I was kind of caught upon when, you know, nobody knew the answer, I was able to sort of actually [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1261.26s)]
*  just, you know, provide the answers to that. And so despite, again, going, you know, just called in [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1266.06s)]
*  inner city London, I had some wonderful teachers that kind of, one, really sort of saw, I think, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1273.5s)]
*  kind of glimpses of sort of talent and really encouraged and nurtured it. And so again, you know, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1279.74s)]
*  despite being in a very deprived areas, I think teachers are some sort of heroes and I kind of [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1284.9399999999998s)]
*  owe a lot to them really, you know, being able to kind of inspire me and continue to encourage me [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1289.7399999999998s)]
*  on that sort of pursuit. And then ultimately, it led to being the first person to go to medical [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1295.58s)]
*  school from my high school. I actually, and it wasn't probably a very high bar, but I actually [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1302.62s)]
*  achieved the best grades in the history of the high school, which I think it was sort of stands [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1308.4599999999998s)]
*  at this stage. But again, it's probably not a high bar, but I think part of that really was [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1314.06s)]
*  that natural interest, I think, just driven by the teachers. And as I mentioned before, my parents, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1319.5s)]
*  just again, you know, really encouraging education and kind of encouraging learning throughout. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1325.58s)]
*  Did that encouragement come through sort of the realization that they didn't have those [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1332.86s)]
*  opportunities? Or were they, were your parents highly educated as well? [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1338.1399999999999s)]
*  No, my parents never went to college. I don't think they went to high school. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1341.74s)]
*  I think my father, again, was somewhat of a self learner. I learned a lot through my father in [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1346.54s)]
*  terms of when he, you know, various things that he would sort of fix or make. And so I always sort [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1353.66s)]
*  of observed him fixing things. And, you know, I think I learned a lot from him doing that. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1358.46s)]
*  So a really incredibly intelligent and smart man without that sort of formal education. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1363.9s)]
*  But again, I think as immigrants and sort of refugees, I think they see again, an opportunity [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1369.74s)]
*  for education really to allow the next generation to kind of improve themselves. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1376.06s)]
*  So I think that's a common sort of cultural sort of doctrine amongst immigrants and something that, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1382.3s)]
*  you know, that we feel really sort of precious now as parents as well for my own children. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1387.98s)]
*  It's amazing. I mean, you know, it's almost sad to dwell on, I suppose. But if you think about the [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1393.66s)]
*  this is completely off topic. But if you think about the intellectual capacity, the potential [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1399.26s)]
*  in so many people who don't have opportunities to exercise that intellectual capacity and [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1406.78s)]
*  nurture it and let it grow. You're absolutely right. I was very fortunate. I kind of reflect [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1411.18s)]
*  back on that, you know, as you point out, my kids go to a very different school to the school that [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1418.78s)]
*  I went. But when I kind of remember some of my classmates, a lot of them were incredibly smart. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1423.66s)]
*  They got lost along the way and didn't find the right path. You know, again, I'm very sort of [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1432.38s)]
*  fortunate to be able to find that path. But to your point, not everybody had that opportunity. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1437.5800000000002s)]
*  So it's somewhat tragic. I think we're not able to support everybody along that range in society. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1442.7s)]
*  Indeed. Yeah, for sure. All right. So, I mean, amazing backstory. I do want to start reeling it [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1448.8600000000001s)]
*  back, you know, back closer to present day, given our time constraints. But as you look at your [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1455.18s)]
*  leadership of Ring now, and I know it's, you know, your leadership there is relatively young in terms [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1462.7800000000002s)]
*  of the amount of time that you've been there. But how would you sort of how would you say that your [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1470.0600000000002s)]
*  background, your backstory has contributed to your leadership style, the culture that you're [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1476.78s)]
*  creating for the company, the, you know, sense of responsibility you have over its people and its [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1482.1399999999999s)]
*  IP and its go forward plan? Yeah, I think, you know, all of our journeys always shape us, right? I [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1489.1799999999998s)]
*  think for me, through my journey, I think, and this is part of our having kind of core values at [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1496.86s)]
*  Ring. One is audacity. You know, despite being incredibly poor at the age of six, [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1502.38s)]
*  I had the audacity to dream and dream big. I knew life would be very different for me as an adult. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1509.0200000000002s)]
*  And I think it's that audacity that we carry through at Ring as a culture and as a leader. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1515.9s)]
*  It's to challenge and be bold about our challenges and beliefs and what we can accomplish. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1521.5800000000002s)]
*  What we're trying to achieve with Nellie viruses is potentially truly transformative. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1527.1000000000001s)]
*  It's not easy, as you know, and you've done so many of these sort of podcasts within the biotech, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1532.46s)]
*  it's not a straightforward path. And so I think the next step around that is resilience. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1537.74s)]
*  Again, from my own to the life journey, there's been many challenges, there's been a lot of [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1543.66s)]
*  hardships. But I think resilience plays a key factor in one, being able to kind of overcome [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1548.0600000000002s)]
*  those hurdles and challenges and continue that journey. And I think that's also important to [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1554.38s)]
*  what we do in the biotech industry. There's a lot of scientific challenges and data that [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1559.66s)]
*  kind of comes out and being kind of creative and being able to address all of those issues. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1565.66s)]
*  And then the last piece, I think really what I'm trying to build at Ring is really to kind of [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1571.1000000000001s)]
*  encourage and build out a diverse, rich organization. I think again, having endured, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1577.66s)]
*  in sort of early childhood, sort of racism during the 80s, and really being really, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1583.9s)]
*  we are often the youngest non-white person in a room. I think that does have a profound [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1591.02s)]
*  impact on you. I think also having kind of a daughter really again kind of influences [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1596.54s)]
*  how your perception around sort of gender equality and diversity really play into organization. So [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1603.74s)]
*  I think life has been lucky and unfortunate and good to me. And I think it's really about [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1610.54s)]
*  taking those journeys and really being able to incorporate those as a leader. And so that's [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1618.46s)]
*  really what I try to do day to day. As we started to kind of get into some of the challenges that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1622.22s)]
*  Ring's working on, you mentioned Enelo Vectors. And to be honest with you, I've done a lot of [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  these podcast interviews. I've talked with a lot of biotech executives across a host of modalities. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1635.58s)]
*  This is new to me. So tell me about it. I mean, I don't want to get too deep into the weeds, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1643.74s)]
*  but I need to understand where this idea of Enelo Vectors came from and why you and Ring [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1648.9399999999998s)]
*  latched onto it and think you can move the ball forward. Yeah. Enelo Vectors are incredible. They [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1656.78s)]
*  have limitless potential. So Enelo Vectors come from Enelo viruses. And so these are viruses that [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1661.98s)]
*  are commensal. They're highly ubiquitous. So they're important in all of us. And these viruses have [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1668.6200000000001s)]
*  co-evolved and lived in harmony inside of humans for millions of years. And that evolution has [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1675.98s)]
*  led them to have very specific traits. So they basically harbor inside different tissues of our [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1683.82s)]
*  bodies, allowing them to be tissue specific and tissue tropic. And then they basically have become [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1688.62s)]
*  immune privileged. So they evade our immune system and this allows them to be essentially the ideal [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1694.78s)]
*  viral vector. So when we think about some of the limitations in terms of viral gene therapy, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1701.02s)]
*  it's about lack of tropism, not having specific potency. It's the immunogenicity that arises [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1706.2199999999998s)]
*  again and the lack of ability to redose. And so essentially Mother Nature has given us, Delta's [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1713.9s)]
*  extremely strong hand with Enelo viruses. And what we've essentially done is to build a platform from [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1721.5800000000002s)]
*  that. And that's the EneloG platform. And so the EneloG platform consists of four different [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1727.66s)]
*  components. First, it's the Enelo Scope, which is a highly powerful proprietary discovery engine. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1733.1000000000001s)]
*  And so what we do is we are able to take human tissue, deep genomic sequence those Brunello [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1739.98s)]
*  viruses, and using those genomic sequences, generate vectors from that. The next part of [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1745.66s)]
*  the platform is the EneloScreen. This is a high throughput testing component that allows us to [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1751.66s)]
*  test those Enelo vectors that we generate. And then through that, there's EneloDesign, when we [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1758.22s)]
*  incorporate machine learning and the learnings from the data that we generate from EneloScreen. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1764.46s)]
*  And then the last final piece is really EneloBricks. So think of this as a modular [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1769.98s)]
*  construction where we're able to take those genomic sequences, generate capsids from that. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1775.1s)]
*  And the really interesting piece of that is not only is it highly scalable, it's that it allows us [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1780.8600000000001s)]
*  to actually introduce different payloads and so introduce payload versatility inside those capsids. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1786.22s)]
*  So we're able to package DNA, RNA, and potentially actually include conjugate peptides on the external [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1792.06s)]
*  surface as well. So being able to be a highly powerful delivery vehicle in addition to that [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1798.86s)]
*  tropism and redosability that we talked about earlier on. How much, if any, work had been done [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1805.34s)]
*  in the space around Enelo viruses prior to Ring and prior to flagships investment in Ring? [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1811.82s)]
*  Was it a popular area? This was a completely uncharted area. I think there's not a lot known [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1818.3799999999999s)]
*  about first of all the human virus, which the viruses that live in and amongst us. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1825.98s)]
*  Flagship pioneering really did a lot of explorations in a number of different [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1832.94s)]
*  areas and hence this is a pioneering aspect around that. But I think in regards to Ring, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1838.6200000000001s)]
*  the exploration was really around the question of are these viruses essentially commensal? [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1844.14s)]
*  And if you take that commensalism, can we actually repurpose them in any useful way? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1850.46s)]
*  And so really from our discovery from early deep genomic sequencing work on blood transfusion, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1855.66s)]
*  we're able to identify commensal viruses that were actually inadvertently trans-used from one [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1862.3799999999999s)]
*  person to another. So transfusions have been going on for the last 200 years and we typically don't [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1868.94s)]
*  screen for Enelo viruses because again they're non-papagenic. And so what we identified from [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1874.3799999999999s)]
*  that study and this is published in the cell paper was really the fact that you can trans-use the [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1879.9s)]
*  Enelo virus between a donor and a recipient. When you do that transfusion, those viruses actually [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1884.54s)]
*  persist. So the immune system of the recipient isn't kicking in and eliminating those viruses. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1890.78s)]
*  And then lastly we were able to identify in certain donors and recipients there was a high [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1898.1399999999999s)]
*  degree of sequence homology between the Enelo viruses that were being donated to the recipient, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1904.86s)]
*  meaning that there was almost a redosing of the same virus to the recipient. And so in some ways, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1910.94s)]
*  inadvertently, the study has always been done where we've been able to demonstrate safety [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1917.82s)]
*  and the potential ability to redose in a way that allows these Enelo viruses or vectors to be [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1922.3s)]
*  persistent. And that's basically the data that led to the foundation of RING in 2017. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1928.78s)]
*  Yeah, that's fascinating. So since that time, has the space beyond RING developed? Are there [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1936.06s)]
*  competitive sets that are looking at the same technologies, the same science and looking to [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1944.46s)]
*  develop therapeutics around them? Not that we're aware of. RING is the first and only company that [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1949.02s)]
*  is pioneering a new class of viral vectors using Enelo viruses. We've established quite substantial [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1956.1399999999999s)]
*  IP around this. Our foundational IP actually covers the vectorization of Enelo viruses. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1963.58s)]
*  And so in this field, IP obviously is a significant factor. I think the other aspect [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1970.3799999999999s)]
*  around this is really pioneering the knowledge around Enelo viruses. So if you look in the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1977.02s)]
*  literature, there's not much published in this space. I think the cell paper was for us somewhat [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1981.26s)]
*  of a landmark paper to start really sharing our scientific understanding around Enelo viruses. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1988.14s)]
*  We've continued to build out that understanding, really through understanding the virology, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=1994.5400000000002s)]
*  the structure, and really how it sort of evades the immune system. And so that's something we [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2000.7800000000002s)]
*  plan to publish in due course. And so stay tuned in regards to that. Excellent. So we talked about [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2004.94s)]
*  some of the challenges, and I'd invite you to go a little deeper on how commensal viruses [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2012.46s)]
*  eliminate some of the challenges we mentioned. We talked about some of those challenges that it [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2020.14s)]
*  overcomes, but surely given it's a new discovery, there are certainly some challenges around [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2025.82s)]
*  developing it as well. So I guess I want to dig into that a little bit and understand what the [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2032.06s)]
*  biggest challenge that you face as a company right now from a biologic development standpoint [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2038.38s)]
*  to move the ball downfield. Yeah, I think it's a double-edged sword when you're pioneers in the [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2045.3400000000001s)]
*  field. I think in terms of obviously the benefits is having that proprietary knowledge that you [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2052.38s)]
*  generate and the IP that you generate. I think on the flip side is that there's very little known [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2059.26s)]
*  in the space. And so I think in terms of just the actual virus itself, the viral biology aspect [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2065.26s)]
*  around it, how it replicates, how we're able to harness some of the biological components around [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2073.0200000000004s)]
*  the viruses, really there's no rule book to that. I think to some extent, there are things we can [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2080.46s)]
*  learn from AEV, but this is a completely different virus to AEV. And in a way, I think some of the [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2088.38s)]
*  things that encumber AEV may not actually apply to another viruses, right? And so that's really [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2098.94s)]
*  why there's truly a transformative potential from that. And so I think that challenge really has [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2105.26s)]
*  allowed us to step up and what we've done at Ring is to build a world-class organization, [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2111.5s)]
*  you know, experts in viral biology, genomics, synthetic biology, machine learning, manufacturing, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2115.58s)]
*  really to kind of get a better understanding around the other viruses. How do we build a platform [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2123.74s)]
*  around that? How we're able to understand the genomic sequence, the DNA of the virus itself? [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2129.58s)]
*  And then how do we basically be able to harness and capitalize on that learning to be able to [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2136.14s)]
*  vectorize it and really be able to introduce the different payloads within that? And so that's [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2142.86s)]
*  really what we've been doing. And I think a big part of that comes from building a world-class team. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2146.94s)]
*  Where are you sort of on that? How many employees are there now? [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2153.7400000000002s)]
*  So we're just over 100 employees as of January. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2158.06s)]
*  Okay. And what does the company look like in terms of data activity? Do you look like a [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2165.34s)]
*  a discovery company, a pre-IND company, a company that's getting ready to take something [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2171.5800000000004s)]
*  toward the clinic? Like how would you sort of characterize the day-to-day activity there? [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2177.42s)]
*  Day-to-day, high-energy, passionate sort of group of individuals. I think what we've been focused on [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2183.7400000000002s)]
*  is building out the platform, validating the components of the platform, and really advancing [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2190.2200000000003s)]
*  the data. And so I think some of the data sets that I mentioned in regards to in vivo, in vitro [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2197.74s)]
*  data, we'll be sort of looking to publish in due course and share that with both [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2203.9799999999996s)]
*  the scientific as well as the biotech industry. And then really continue to advance the pipeline, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2208.7799999999997s)]
*  advancing those candidates that near term we're looking to doing IMD enabling studies, [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2214.9399999999996s)]
*  and then looking forward to being in the clinic soon. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2220.3799999999997s)]
*  Tell me about those candidates. What indications do you anticipate pursuing? [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2223.1800000000003s)]
*  So we're focused on, again, as I mentioned before, just building out the platform. I think when you [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2228.38s)]
*  look at the analoviruses, there's a somewhat, and I often sort of say this, there's a bit of [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2232.86s)]
*  an embarrassment of riches, right? There's not much that analoviruses can't do in terms of just [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2238.86s)]
*  as a class of viral vectors. And so when you look at just tissue tropism and the diseases and tissues [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2245.82s)]
*  that it can target, again, a vast degree of opportunity. I think the other piece that we're [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2253.66s)]
*  just trying to get our hands and wrapping our arms around is really the payload versatility. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2259.82s)]
*  As I mentioned, as we generate these capsids, we can introduce DNA, RNA, and external peptides [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2265.5s)]
*  on those viral particles. And that allows us again to address multiple diseases through [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2273.26s)]
*  multiple modalities as well. And so really, it's a challenging conundrum to be able to want, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2280.38s)]
*  continue obviously building that platform, but really the expansive opportunities we have. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2290.0600000000004s)]
*  And so we'll be able to share that in due course. But I'm looking forward to getting to the point [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2295.9s)]
*  where we can definitely share that in more detail. Yeah, yeah, me too. It's exciting to follow. And [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2301.02s)]
*  it'll be cool to know that when the time is right. At this particular juncture of the company, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2309.1s)]
*  it occurs to me that perhaps outlicensing the technology or partnership would be potential [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2315.34s)]
*  avenues you might go, right? Like, do you have any thoughts around that you can share that as an, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2323.74s)]
*  I understand if you can't, but do you have any thoughts as the company's leader, setting the [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2332.06s)]
*  course, kind of setting a vision where you want to be versus what any number of opportunities could [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2337.8199999999997s)]
*  take you off course? But do you want to become a therapeutics company? Do you want to become a [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2343.2599999999998s)]
*  platform that works with other cell and gene therapeutics companies, all of the above? [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2347.98s)]
*  Yeah, I think as a flagship pioneering company, we're a platform company. I think, as I mentioned [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2356.78s)]
*  before, we have an embarrassment of riches and the another vector is a highly powerful platform [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2364.54s)]
*  in both in terms of its properties for tropism, redosability, but also in terms of what it can [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2372.06s)]
*  deliver in terms of modalities and the diseases it can address. I've always been front and center, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2377.02s)]
*  a physician, a drug developer, and really someone that wants to innovate therapeutics to patients. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2387.1s)]
*  I don't think we can address all of the diseases on our own at Ring. We're somewhat of a small [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2392.86s)]
*  company. And I think there's a lot of strategic partnerships that we can establish within this [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2398.3s)]
*  great sort of ecosystem that we have. And so that allows us to one, continue innovating both our [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2405.58s)]
*  platform, being able to innovate therapeutics to patients and having more therapeutics towards [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2411.42s)]
*  those patients. But yeah, still retain a lot of shareholder value and still retain value, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2416.46s)]
*  as well as proprietary knowledge within Ring that we can continue developing our own programs within [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2422.54s)]
*  the platform as well. Yeah, yeah, very cool. This embarrassment of riches that you've referred to a [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2428.22s)]
*  couple of times, just give me a little bit of flavor as to, I mean, I understand that, as you [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2433.74s)]
*  said, there aren't necessarily any other players that are in the space right now. There weren't [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2439.18s)]
*  prior to Ring. Why is that? I mean, was it just a flat out recent discovery that there's potential [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2444.06s)]
*  here? Or were there, in a lot of cases we talk about over the course of history, vectors or [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2450.06s)]
*  modalities or therapeutics that struggled for a long time before they hit? Was that the case? Were [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2458.78s)]
*  there attempts that failed previously? Just give us a little bit of the backstory on that. Yeah, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2464.38s)]
*  it's interesting. I think the human virome is a really undiscovered and untapped area. There's [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2469.42s)]
*  very little known about the human virome, right? And so commensal viruses come from that sort of [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2477.82s)]
*  ecosystem, which we call the human virome. And then typically when you're looking at the whole [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2484.22s)]
*  field of virology, people study viruses that cause disease, you know, pandemic kind of case in point, [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2490.62s)]
*  look at the amount of research, obviously for good cause that's come out from this pandemic. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2497.74s)]
*  But that focus has really been trying to attribute the virus to a disease. And so when you come across [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2504.22s)]
*  a commensal virus, there's very little interest in studying it. And so I think flagship was very [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2509.34s)]
*  astute in following that up in regards to, look, these are somewhat non-pathogenic, but then again, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2519.98s)]
*  potentially could we harness these for any other sort of useful purpose to deliver a [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2527.58s)]
*  bit of therapeutics? And so that led to some of the explorations that we did at flagship pioneering [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2531.34s)]
*  and ultimately the build of the analogy platform to be able to harness those [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2537.9s)]
*  analog viruses inside of our bodies. And really, again, being able to innovate on the nature inside [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2542.94s)]
*  of our bodies to create a new class of viral vectors. Yeah, that's very interesting. We're [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2549.9s)]
*  starting to run short on time here, Dr. Ong. So I'm going to ask you a couple of wrap up questions. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2557.42s)]
*  What's next? What's the next big thing on Dr. Ong's agenda? [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2562.94s)]
*  I've been, I always kind of say, I've been more blessed than I probably deserve to be. I don't [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2568.86s)]
*  know what I've done to be this fortunate both in life and with the family that I have. So for me, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2576.78s)]
*  it's about paying forward. It's about building a diverse, rich organization at Ring Therapeutics. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2583.6600000000003s)]
*  It's about being able to take analog vectors and really being able to innovate and hopefully [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2593.8199999999997s)]
*  transform humanity in a way that's meaningful. So that's really my focus. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2599.98s)]
*  Yeah. Any specific or profound advice for other young biotech entrepreneurs, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2606.22s)]
*  folks who are trying to make a go of this? That's a difficult one. I guess when I set out to do this, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2614.7799999999997s)]
*  I didn't realize that I would in fact potentially be a role model. And it's funny that [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2622.46s)]
*  people have reached out to me and shared how my journey has inspired them. I think partly because [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2629.26s)]
*  that they see themselves as potentially being a minority and leader in the biotech field. So I [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2635.98s)]
*  think my first advice would be, don't let people judge you and chart your own course. I think my [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2645.34s)]
*  other sort of advice would be process and reflect. I think what we do is challenging. There's a lot [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2653.9s)]
*  in terms of our day to day and I think kind of taking time out really to be able to reflect. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2662.38s)]
*  Sometimes not all the answers kind of come together all at once. And I think sometimes just [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2668.6200000000003s)]
*  having that time during this kind of chaos that kind of occurs around us [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2673.66s)]
*  really allows us to kind of get to the final answer. Yeah. That's definitely profound advice. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2679.66s)]
*  And I think I got to tell you, we've done a lot of podcast episodes and this is the first time [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2686.8599999999997s)]
*  I've covered racism, immigration, the love between a father and a son, plus the science. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2693.8999999999996s)]
*  So I was just reflecting on this. We covered a lot of ground today and I want to thank you for [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2703.8199999999997s)]
*  your transparency. No, it's been a pleasure. No, my pleasure. I think my journey has been [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2712.54s)]
*  challenging for myself in a way where I think in the beginning it was somewhat of a source of shame. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2724.54s)]
*  I think that what I've learned is that it's a source of strength. I'm glad and proud that now [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2732.54s)]
*  it's inspired others like me and I want to be able to use my voice. And so I thank you for the [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2738.62s)]
*  opportunity to be able to share my voice and hopefully inspire others to do so. That's something [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2746.3s)]
*  that I've had to kind of grow and develop and so I appreciate that opportunity. Yeah. Well, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2752.7s)]
*  inspiring it is and I appreciate you for sharing that story. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2758.22s)]
*  Thank you. So that's Ring Therapeutics CEO, Dr. Tuan Ong. I'm Matt Piller and this is the business [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VCycHuAe9Y&t=2762.62s)]
