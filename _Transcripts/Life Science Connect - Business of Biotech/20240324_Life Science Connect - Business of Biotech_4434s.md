Video Description: Few drug discovery and development concepts are as hyped, and as such, draw as much polarity from drug developers, as machine learning and artificial intelligence. One company on the bullish end of the spectrum is Flagship Pioneering's Generate: Biomedicines, which bills itself at the "intersection of machine learning, biological engineering, and medicine." To get a grip on the "generative biology" work it's doing and the AI/ML impact it anticipates in the discovery and development of therapeutics, as well as clinical trials, we sat down with veteran biotech builder Mike Nally, CEO at Generate and CEO-Partner at Flagship Pioneering.

*  The artificial intelligence and machine learning drumbeats are only getting louder in biotech, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=40.0s)]
*  and that trend will continue for the foreseeable future. When a new tech fires up the hype machine, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  it's our job as industry observers to suss out what's real. Who's actually adopting and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  applying the technology to affect outcomes in drug discovery, development, and ultimately patient [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=56.8s)]
*  access? When virtually every biotech who's parsing a little data on a computer calls itself [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=62.32s)]
*  AI-powered, doing that sussing is easier said than done. I'm Matt Piller. This is the business [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=68.24s)]
*  of biotech, and on today's episode, I'm sitting down with the leader of one company that's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=74.96s)]
*  decidedly applying sophisticated computational technologies to its biologic development efforts. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=79.28s)]
*  Flagship Pioneerings Generate Biomedicines, led by ex-Merc CMO of human health Mike Nalley, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=86.16s)]
*  is using machine learning to make big use of big data, and it's raising big money along the way to [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=93.28s)]
*  support the initiative. I sat down with Mike in San Francisco to learn all about it. Let's give it a [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=98.88s)]
*  listen. You know, we're going to talk about a lot, but I want to start with you because when I look [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=104.39999999999999s)]
*  at your background, it's not, you know, from an early point post-academia, it's not like it wasn't [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=110.4s)]
*  written in the stars. You were going to be a biotech CEO. You were a financial analyst at Merc [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  that came fresh out of your Harvard MBA, which came on the heels of an economics degree. That's [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=125.44000000000001s)]
*  right. So that was in 2003, and in 2021, you were still at Merc. You were CMO of human health. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=131.6s)]
*  So there's many questions in there. One of them being, like, that's a long run. That's a long run [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=140.16s)]
*  to be at that company. So why did you decide to leave the comforts of a company like Merc, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=149.68s)]
*  where you surely could have wrote out the entirety of your career? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=157.36s)]
*  It's a really great question. I think, you know, part of my own personal journey, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=161.76000000000002s)]
*  when I graduated college, I grew up outside of New York City, and I thought the path of salvation [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=168.08s)]
*  was to be an investment banker, because that's what all my friends' parents did. My father had [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=176.56s)]
*  his own little business, and in many respects, he was the anomaly within the community that I grew up [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=180.48000000000002s)]
*  with. What was his business? He was in sporting goods. Oh, really? So he was a sporting goods [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=186.88s)]
*  manufacturer. He'd go over to China, manufacture, and then sell to the mass merchants. And, you know, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=191.52s)]
*  it was a great business, but, you know, he was an entrepreneur through and through. But everyone [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=196.24s)]
*  else in the town were bankers. And, you know, I went and studied finance thinking, you know, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=203.44s)]
*  that's what you did when you grew up. And I think, you know, as I stepped back, you know, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=209.84s)]
*  after the first couple of years, I realized I was missing that sense of purpose. I was missing, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  you know, to what end am I doing all this work? And, you know, at least for me, you know, the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=221.44000000000003s)]
*  feeling of, you know, slaving away, working, you know, 100-hour weeks to make money for rich people [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=227.04000000000002s)]
*  was not how I wanted to spend my time. And some of my best friends are investment bankers, so I don't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=235.84s)]
*  mean any disrespect for the field. But for me personally, I wanted a broader sense of purpose [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=240.32000000000002s)]
*  in my work. And I was fortunate during that time to touch on the pharmaceutical industry. And when [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=245.52s)]
*  I went back to business school, I went with a distinct purpose of transitioning careers. Now, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=250.72s)]
*  I was really lucky when I, you know, knew some of the folks at Merck. One of the ladies who was [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=257.04s)]
*  kind of a financial Mozart, who was a CFO, the first female CFO of a Fortune 500 company said, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=264.88s)]
*  Mike, if you come to Merck, I'll show you the whole company. And this is a lady named Judy [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=271.6s)]
*  Lewant. And, you know, Judy basically was true to her word every 18 months, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=276.24s)]
*  I was doing a different assignment. So I started in the company as a financial analyst doing [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=282.32s)]
*  competitive intelligence, worked on a late stage pipeline, did the pre-commercialization work for [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=286.56s)]
*  a diabetes product called Genuvia, was put into investor relations during the BIAX trials, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=291.76s)]
*  went into business development, you know, did the sharing fund merger. So if you think about, you [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=297.12s)]
*  know, that sort of broad exposure, I'm a voracious learner. I was gonna say, like, you're talking [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=303.6s)]
*  about this, and I'm thinking like, you've got to be wired a little bit differently. You've got to [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=311.12s)]
*  be a sponge, right? I mean, you've got to be a sponge. Well, I love, you know, I love science. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=316.16s)]
*  I love, you know, kind of, you know, the learning process. There's so much complexity in the end [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  to end business model for these large pharmaceutical companies. I mean, if you think about it, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=331.84s)]
*  it's a miracle that we're able to come up with medicines. And, you know, these medicines are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=336.0s)]
*  harder than putting a man on the moon. You know, in the scientific challenge, the manufacturing [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=342.32s)]
*  challenges, the commercial challenges to make sure that the world has access to these medicines [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=350.24s)]
*  require really dedicated, committed professionals. And, you know, as I went on those different [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=355.28s)]
*  rotations through Merck, I was just really blessed to see the end to end process, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=363.28s)]
*  working with some of the best people in the industry. And, you know, within any organization, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=368.47999999999996s)]
*  when I joined Merck, I thought I was gonna be there two to three years. Right. And- [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, now were you thinking, like, at the time, you talked about seeking, not to get you off track [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=377.11999999999995s)]
*  here, but you talked about seeking a more meaningful end, right? Rather than getting rich [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=381.76s)]
*  and making rich people richer, a more meaningful- Was the Pharmaceutical Initiative, Life Sciences, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=388.64s)]
*  what was that sort of the- at that time, was that like, well, yeah, that's the place or, you know, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=393.92s)]
*  why not some other philanthropic endeavor or- Well, I think, you know, combining a background [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=398.24s)]
*  business with a endeavor that basically was, you know, it's set up to improve the health and [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  wellbeing of the population was something that was really attractive to me. I also loved the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=413.28000000000003s)]
*  global nature of the industry. I loved the challenges that the industry were facing. You [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  know, the industry has been under kind of seminal challenges for the last 25 years. Right. R&D [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=425.12s)]
*  productivity going down. You think about pricing challenges, right? Access challenges. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=432.96s)]
*  These are things that unfortunately have undermined the reputation of what was once seen as a very [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=438.64s)]
*  noble industry and has made it, you know, on par reputationally with tobacco in the link public. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=445.52s)]
*  And, you know, the questions we have to answer and solve for as an industry are really, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=454.79999999999995s)]
*  really profound. And if someone who loves complex challenges, if someone who loves these sort of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=462.24s)]
*  puzzles, trying to figure out how you right the ship so that you can solve some of the world's [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=467.68s)]
*  greatest medical needs. And, you know, when you talk about sense of purpose, you know, I had the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=475.76s)]
*  privilege of working on some of the most impactful programs, products that the industry's ever seen. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=481.52s)]
*  Ketrida. Yeah. Right. Indicated are 30 different tumor types. Yeah. You think about the number of [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=488.64s)]
*  lives you can impact. You think about Gardasil for the HPV vaccine. You know, the prospect that we [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  can now eliminate cervical cancer from this planet. Some of the HIV medicines, right? Where you're, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=501.52s)]
*  you know, you're, you know, often the prospect ultimately of stopping the transmission dynamics [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=506.79999999999995s)]
*  and HIV. These are things that have global impact. And, you know, millions of people [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=511.59999999999997s)]
*  are going to live longer, healthier, happier lives. Right. The result of that work. And that's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=519.92s)]
*  what's fulfilling what we do. Right. And that's why, you know, a year, two years, three years at [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=525.4399999999999s)]
*  Merck became 18. I was constantly learning. I was constantly challenged. I had mentors [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=531.52s)]
*  who believed in me in ways that I didn't believe in myself. Yeah. There were jumps that I took in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=537.28s)]
*  my career that I probably wouldn't have taken without steady encouragement. You know, Judy was [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=542.16s)]
*  one mentor, Ken Frazier, Merck's former CEO was another who constantly said, Mike, we want you to [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=548.4s)]
*  go to Sweden and run our Swedish business. I had basically been to Sweden for one day of my life, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=556.4s)]
*  knew nothing about the Swedish healthcare system. It was asked to run that organization. And [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=561.52s)]
*  those were opportunities for me to actually become much more self-aware as a professional, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=567.52s)]
*  to learn, to grow, to grow personally with my family going to Sweden, but also professionally, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=574.4s)]
*  but also contribute to a much greater cause. And that's part of what made, you know, the 18 years [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=581.12s)]
*  at Merck so special. Yeah. It's interesting. The impact, you talk about the impact that you were [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=586.16s)]
*  able to play a part of in Merck. Often when I, and specific examples, Ketruda, Gardasil, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=591.92s)]
*  I mean, amazing. Often when I talk with big bio turned biotech CEOs, they tell me that, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=597.68s)]
*  maybe ironically, the tipping point for them wanting to jump into biotech, you know, small, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=605.76s)]
*  nimble, agile, scrappy, is because they want to feel like they have more of an impact than they [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=612.88s)]
*  did in big bio. So that's sort of an interesting dichotomy. Well, I think you have more control [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=617.92s)]
*  in biotech. You know, the litmus test that I had when I thought about, you know, leaving Merck [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=626.16s)]
*  was wherever I was going to go, I had a belief fundamentally, I could have a greater impact on [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  humanity. And there aren't many organizations in the world that can have a greater impact on [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=638.0s)]
*  humanity than the company like Merck. Right. If you think about the history of the company, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=644.16s)]
*  from the mass production of penicillin in the 50s, all the way through a series of antivirals, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=648.4s)]
*  vaccines, you know, 7 of the 11 CDC recommended vaccines were invented by Merck, the cardiovascular [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=655.12s)]
*  drugs, the HIV drugs, all the way now through an array of cancer products. It's a company that's [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=662.4s)]
*  had a huge impact on society. And, you know, in the 90s, Merck was the it company. It was Fortune's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=671.52s)]
*  Most Admired 27 years in a row. And that's because of an unparalleled track record of not only [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=683.12s)]
*  scientific innovation, but doing good for humanity. Programs like the Mectizan Donation Program, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=692.24s)]
*  which, you know, have basically eliminated river blindness, were a huge part of what made the company [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=698.4799999999999s)]
*  a special place. And, you know, that is, you know, this industry at its best, where you can do good [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=704.8s)]
*  for shareholders, while doing good for humanity. And that was a core part of, I think, what I [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=711.68s)]
*  learned within Merck. And, you know, as I thought about going to biotech, certainly in a smaller [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=717.76s)]
*  organization, the impact of your actions and decisions, you know, at Merck, you had to influence [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=725.44s)]
*  a 72,000 person organization. In a biotech organization, when I joined Generate, it was [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=732.6400000000001s)]
*  30 people. Obviously, you know, each of those 30 employees had a huge impact on the success of the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=738.08s)]
*  organization. Sometimes it was harder to see that impact in a big company. But I think the impact of [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=745.7600000000001s)]
*  the collective work of the 72,000 was enormous. And depending on how you're measuring, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=751.52s)]
*  you come up with different viewpoints. So, I mean, if listeners didn't know that your CEO partner [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=759.28s)]
*  at flagship, the CEO at Generate, they might think you're still an executive part, very [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=766.4s)]
*  passionate about the work you did there. Why did you leave? You know, you could have stayed there until... [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=772.8s)]
*  I believe Merck, you know, it's a company that is near and dear to my heart. It's a company [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=778.32s)]
*  with some of my best friends, some of my proudest professional moments. I was really just fortunate [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=787.0400000000001s)]
*  to uncover an amazing opportunity, where I think it's a generational technology. And, you know, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=794.5600000000001s)]
*  when I was at Merck, one of the things that I was fortunate enough to do was lead Merck's vaccine [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=802.8s)]
*  business. While I was leading Merck's vaccine business, we had an early partnership with [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=807.5999999999999s)]
*  Moderna and vaccines. During that time, I got to know Stefan Banzel and Nubar Fahen. So, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=812.7199999999999s)]
*  Stefan is the CEO of Moderna and Nubar is the founder and CEO of flagship pioneer. And [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=820.4s)]
*  we had had conversations over the years around, you know, if I were to ever leave Merck, what would [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=827.6800000000001s)]
*  I want to do? And over time, I became increasingly convinced that the future of the industry was [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=833.36s)]
*  going to lie at the intersection of science and technology. And I became increasingly frustrated [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=842.72s)]
*  in many respects that the industry wasn't having enough success at changing the underlying [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=851.04s)]
*  productivity curve. We've talked about it forever that in four decades in a row, industry-wide, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=860.4s)]
*  R&D productivity has been going down. And I think somewhat interrelatedly, but not entirely, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=868.16s)]
*  that has led to bad pricing practices within the industry. And those pricing practices have [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=874.0s)]
*  undermined patient access to medicines. And that's what I think creates some of the reputation [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=882.0799999999999s)]
*  conundrum that the industry finds itself within. And I became the belief on why science and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=888.16s)]
*  technology would be this kind of potential answer. And it's simply, you know, the fact that I think [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=895.52s)]
*  it's inarguable to look at the fact that despite staring at biology in the eye for all of our [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=903.76s)]
*  existence as humanity, we only know a small fraction of the majesty of biology. And with [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=911.2s)]
*  the advances in technology that we were seeing all around us, we were entering an age where [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=920.6400000000001s)]
*  the combination of brilliant human ingenuity and computation and technology was going to start to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  help us understand the language of biology and ways that the human mind alone couldn't understand [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=936.96s)]
*  it. And fortunately, the team at Flagship was working on a company called Generate Biomedicines. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=942.08s)]
*  Generate was founded five years ago. When I first received this call, roughly three years ago, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=952.64s)]
*  a little over three years ago, generative artificial intelligence was not part of my lexicon [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=959.12s)]
*  or the common lexicon. Right. I mean, it's still a black box to most. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=965.6s)]
*  To most, yeah. But this team recognized that by applying a top-down approach to the language of [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=969.92s)]
*  proteins and using these sort of generative technologies, we would be able to understand [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=977.84s)]
*  that language in a way that would allow us to ultimately learn how to program novel protein-based [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=983.6s)]
*  therapeutics with desired advocates. And in the 20 years I've been part of the industry, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=990.4s)]
*  the early days, I had never seen anything like the early data. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=997.2s)]
*  Yeah. And if you think about how we discover [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1001.2800000000001s)]
*  protein therapeutics today, we immunize a human and mouse, a llama, we call through plasma, [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1003.68s)]
*  we find things that stick to interesting targets, and then we manipulate them. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1010.16s)]
*  In a pure trial and error process. Yeah. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1014.9599999999999s)]
*  We have no control over the antibodies our immune systems create. We then try and make them into [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1017.8399999999999s)]
*  drug-like entities. Think about the world where we say, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1023.68s)]
*  give me a molecule with this code to treat this disease. Yeah. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1030.32s)]
*  I mean, it sounds science fiction. And in many ways, we're not by any means there yet. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1037.52s)]
*  Sure. But we're on a path toward that destination. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1044.6399999999999s)]
*  And this technology was helping us start to understand that language of proteins in [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1049.04s)]
*  really profound ways. And some of the things that we were able to do were just beyond my [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1054.56s)]
*  wildest imagination. Some of the kind of interesting tidbits that I picked up as I was looking into the [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1061.36s)]
*  opportunity were the average protein, we have 20 natural amino acids. The average protein may be [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1069.44s)]
*  200 amino acids long. So if you think about the combinatorial possibilities of proteins, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1077.92s)]
*  at 20 to 200,000, that's atoms in the universe cubed. Yeah. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1084.0800000000002s)]
*  This search space is extraordinary. And oftentimes we think about nature as being this [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1089.6000000000001s)]
*  all-powerful, all-knowing being. The reality is that nature has always surveyed a small fraction [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1096.72s)]
*  of that search space. It's just too large. Right. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1106.48s)]
*  And if you have a technology that will allow you to survey those oceans, [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1110.48s)]
*  you're going to find some really interesting things. And we're finding that on a daily basis, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1114.56s)]
*  these technologies are helping us understand biology better, they're helping us come up with [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1120.3999999999999s)]
*  better answers to existing conditions, but also giving us new tools now to prosecute disease in [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1125.9199999999998s)]
*  very unique ways. Yeah. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1132.56s)]
*  We're going to get back to the science of the end. I was just clearly very excited about it. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1134.6399999999999s)]
*  We're going to get back to that because I want to pause for a minute at the moment of the [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1139.04s)]
*  transition. You were excited about it then, and you remain excited about it. You joined Flagship, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1143.12s)]
*  you come on as CEO at Generate 2021. That's right. How aware were you that you were signing up for [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1149.76s)]
*  a post that was going to face the headwinds at that time? How aware were you that you were [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1160.4s)]
*  not from a scientific and excitement standpoint? You're coming with the energy, I get it. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1165.76s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're like, yeah, I'm the CEO of this new company. We're [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1170.0s)]
*  destined to solve all these problems. And then all of a sudden, the whole space goes to shit. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1175.44s)]
*  Well, we were really lucky. If you think about the peak of the biotech market was February 2021. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1182.48s)]
*  I started March of 2021. Yeah. But I don't think people realized that, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1189.8400000000001s)]
*  I think people thought it was going to be a momentary blip for a while in 2021. During that [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1194.48s)]
*  period, we raised $370 million as part of our series B finance. And we raised it from an [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1199.76s)]
*  extraordinary group of investors who share our vision for the future promise of the technology. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1206.16s)]
*  And so, as I think the downturn started to be fully realized, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1216.08s)]
*  we were in a very strong position from a capital shift. And... [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1222.4s)]
*  Did you kind of know that coming in? Did you kind of know like, this is risky. There's always [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1227.2s)]
*  inherent risk in joining biotech and leading a biotech, but relative to the downward curve, [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1234.4s)]
*  we're in a good position. To be honest, I think this whole idea of risk is grossly overstated. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1242.08s)]
*  Every independent biotech endeavor has inherent risk. But if you think about the unmet need and [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1250.56s)]
*  the number of opportunities across the biotech ecosystem, failure is part of our model. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1258.0s)]
*  As long as you're failing for valid scientific reasons, sometimes the biology just is not going [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1263.44s)]
*  to work out. But if you're giving it a shot, there's going to be plenty of opportunity [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1273.76s)]
*  on the other side, as long as you can manage the business side of things well. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1279.44s)]
*  And certainly in 2021, if you thought about the biotech ecosystem, companies were springing up [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1286.4s)]
*  left and right. So opportunity was plentiful. So the risk of generating not working out to me was, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1293.04s)]
*  okay, I go do another opportunity. And I think you've seen that across this ecosystem for a long [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1302.24s)]
*  time. We're in a glorious era of scientific innovation. And the science, you've heard this [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1309.68s)]
*  from countless people, the science has never been better. So what needs to be better [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1317.44s)]
*  to sustain? Because we've seen over the course of the last 18, 24, 36 months, a lot of great [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1325.92s)]
*  science gets shelved. Back burner flush. So you hit an important point, as long as you [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1332.72s)]
*  manage the business. People are the rate linger. It's not capital. Great teams are the rate linger. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1340.88s)]
*  So I think there's plentiful science. And not always will the science work out. You can have [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  an extraordinary biological hypothesis. One of the things that you learn, this is part of like, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1355.52s)]
*  if you think about my time at Merck, it's like I got a PhD in this industry from Merck. And [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1362.0800000000002s)]
*  the best scientific minds that we've ever encountered in life sciences are wrong 80 to 90% of the time. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1371.0400000000002s)]
*  And here I'm in the business. And I'm certainly not in that category. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1380.88s)]
*  You know, failure is part of this model. So to me, as soon as you acknowledge that, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1385.2s)]
*  the way you manage that to a certain extent is you build an extraordinary team. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1394.24s)]
*  Really great people in a cross-disciplinary manner. If you have an opportunity, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1400.16s)]
*  you find a portfolio or platform. And part of what attracted me to the opportunity of flagship [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1408.0s)]
*  and the opportunity to generate was that it wasn't a single asset. Because again, I'm not smart enough [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1413.92s)]
*  to pick the winner. But if I have a portfolio, I can then manage the odds in a very different way. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1420.8s)]
*  Across 10 assets, the expected value starts to become greater than one. And in that sort of a [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1431.76s)]
*  world, I think it plays to the strengths of someone who has more of a business background. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1440.0s)]
*  And to me, the period of 2021, the biggest issue that we actually encountered [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1446.0s)]
*  was dilution of talent. You saw the skyrocketing number of biotech companies, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  of public biotech companies, of private biotech companies, of new startups. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1462.9599999999998s)]
*  And that created position in title inflation across the industry. And the world doesn't need [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1467.52s)]
*  the sixth and seventh and eighth in class approach to the same problem. There was actually too much. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1475.52s)]
*  Too many companies started. And unfortunately, I think we've had to go through a pretty rough [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1483.28s)]
*  data internal over the last couple of years. And we've seen a number of those companies struggle [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  to sustain financing through that period. But over time, that raw scientific foundation is in [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1497.84s)]
*  place. There still is a lot of capital. And certainly the assets that show real clinical [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1505.84s)]
*  proof are getting funded. And I think we'll see this pendulum swings back and forth on [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1514.56s)]
*  product versus platform. In 2021, it was in vogue to be a platform, largely because [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1522.0800000000002s)]
*  a platform technology and mRNA was saving the world. In 2022 and 2023, it was much less in vogue [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1529.2s)]
*  to be a platform. Over time that- Well, the RNA space still- [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1538.0s)]
*  There's still plenty of opportunities. There's still plenty of platform. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1542.48s)]
*  Absolutely. But those things will go back and forth in terms of sentiment. And so, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1545.44s)]
*  I think for me, for the industry, this period has been one where I think you rightly point out, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  some really great science will get caught up in this downturn. Some really great teams will get [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1561.52s)]
*  caught up in this downturn. Some teams will get caught up in a valuation trap in some respects, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1567.84s)]
*  where if you raise in 2021, 2020, at the peak of the market, major down rounds would be required [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1575.6s)]
*  to sustain organizations. And that's really hard. And so, it's been really a rough period, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  but I think as we enter this year, certainly we now have had the two best months on record [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1592.96s)]
*  in the biotech industry over the last couple of months. That gives us a lot of green shoots [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1598.8s)]
*  as we enter 2024 to start to make a big difference again. Yeah. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1603.44s)]
*  You talked about the fact that you probably wouldn't have signed on for such an endeavor, [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1608.32s)]
*  had it been a single asset company, and on the perfect sense, it's logical. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1613.6000000000001s)]
*  In the platform space or the platform play, what's sort of the, you got a single asset, [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1618.16s)]
*  you've got to hit milestones to make, you got to make the money stretch to the next milestone, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1626.4s)]
*  get more money. It's kind of that leapfrogging. So, I understand where the platform play gives [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1631.3600000000001s)]
*  you more to work with, but how does that change sort of the milestone picture? Like you've still [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1639.6000000000001s)]
*  got to produce something to reach a milestone. I think in terms of the executional rhythm that [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1647.44s)]
*  you want to instill within a company, I don't think it changes anything. There's just different [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1654.24s)]
*  milestones. I mean, I'm as accountable to my shareholders as a single product. So, if I say [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1658.72s)]
*  advance the technology on X, Y, and Z dimension, the compact and in some ways I have with my [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1670.24s)]
*  investors is if I say I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that. And if I say I'm going to have [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1678.72s)]
*  two programs at the clinic this year, I've got to show progress on that front. And so, it just, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1686.0s)]
*  it gives you more levers. And sometimes those levers, when something runs afoul, you can [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1693.12s)]
*  replace it with something else. So, it gives you a bit more flexibility, a bit more optionality. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1701.84s)]
*  But I think the executional rigor has to be the same irrespective of whether you're in a [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1708.8799999999999s)]
*  one product company or a platform organization. I mean, that's what builds trust with your board, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1715.92s)]
*  with other stakeholders, with your employees for that matter. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1723.92s)]
*  Mike Houdini You mentioned your 2021 Series B. More recently, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1726.0800000000002s)]
*  you raised the $280 million Series C. So, I'm hoping for some insight on that, how you made [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1731.3600000000001s)]
*  that happen. What was key to it? How it was executed? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1738.64s)]
*  Mike Houdini I think what was really key to it was [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1741.36s)]
*  when we look back at what we suggest that we would do with our finance, financing from our Series B, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1746.08s)]
*  we delivered that milestone. So, we had earned the trust of all of our existing investors [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1752.48s)]
*  participating in our Series C. We had 16 Series B investors, and all 16 of them stepped into [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1759.76s)]
*  our Series C financing. And as you can imagine, given market conditions, everyone was in different [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1767.1200000000001s)]
*  situations. They all decided to continue to put the trust in the team that generated. And that was [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1775.3600000000001s)]
*  really, really meaningful to me, to the entire organization. At the same time, we were able to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1783.76s)]
*  attract an array of different new investors in the process. It was much, I mean, the level of [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1788.88s)]
*  diligence that went into the round was night and day between 2021 and 2023. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1798.88s)]
*  Mike Houdini Yeah, to use an overused term, let's unpack [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1804.24s)]
*  that a little bit. That's one of the questions I have for you is, in more of a rudimentary way to [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1807.44s)]
*  put it, what not necessarily frustrates you the way the deals are being done today, but what's [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1813.28s)]
*  different about it? Michael Svigel Well, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1820.08s)]
*  listen, I think, again, I think of these things, and sometimes we hit different polls. In 2021, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1822.6399999999999s)]
*  it may have been a little loose. In 2023, it was probably, the orientation in 2021 was, how do I [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1829.52s)]
*  find a way to play capital? In 23, the orientation, the starting point for many investors was, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1837.6s)]
*  I don't want to play capital, but I want to look. And so you're always finding reasons not to invest [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1847.52s)]
*  versus finding reasons to invest. And listen, within the round that we were able to put together, [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1854.56s)]
*  a big key of it was our ability not only to show the track record of execution, but also show [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1862.88s)]
*  the enormous promise over the next 24 to 36 months. And as we were in the process of raising, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1870.56s)]
*  we talked about having multiple programs, homegrown programs enter the clinic. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1880.24s)]
*  These are programs that were started by Generate a couple of years ago using the platform. The [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1884.64s)]
*  first one that went into the clinic was 17 months from concept to clinic. The second one was about [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1891.2s)]
*  two years. They're addressing major medical needs, their technologies, their approaches that are very [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1896.32s)]
*  distinctive for the individual targets that we've gone after. So in many ways, we were able to show [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1903.52s)]
*  promise to both our existing and future investors that they said, this is a great time. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1912.0s)]
*  Is there a difference in your mind? I mean, obviously there are a lot of variables behind [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1919.2s)]
*  the decision to invest in a company, like Generate, any company for that matter. And you mentioned the [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1926.56s)]
*  importance of the support of your existing investor base. And then you mentioned you've [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1933.3600000000001s)]
*  got some new ones. Do you see any, I guess, lines of demarcation between what turned the new ones [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1939.2s)]
*  on to Generate versus those that you already had? Were the tire kickers more interested in the [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1946.56s)]
*  future? Were they happy to get on board with great investors who were happy to see results over the [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1952.72s)]
*  past 18 months? What was sort of... Well, I think every investor follows a slightly different [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1958.6399999999999s)]
*  formula. So anything we say is going to be somewhat of a generalization. But I think [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1965.1999999999998s)]
*  the commonalities that I would pull out, one is people usually back people. And I've been really [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1972.0s)]
*  fortunate to be able to recruit a world-class team. And that team, I think instills confidence in both [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1983.76s)]
*  new and existing investors. But on the jacking of the horse? And I think there's an element to that. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1990.72s)]
*  I think to the horse... We don't want to have this thread at the horse. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=1999.68s)]
*  But Generate AI has a pretty cool space room. I think certainly over the course of the past couple [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2005.2s)]
*  of years, it's become part of the common lexicon. And I think we started to see on an individual [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2012.96s)]
*  and personal level, the transformative impact that these sort of technologies can have. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2021.44s)]
*  CHAT GPT raised Generative AI to the collective consciousness. And it started to show people [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2026.88s)]
*  the enormous potential. Before the kind of Generative AI revolution, most people thought of [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2035.3600000000001s)]
*  AI and technologies as largely efficiency plays. It was about speed and efficiency. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. What Generative AI has shown now is it aids the creative process. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2052.96s)]
*  I can have CHAT GPT be a thought partner. While maintaining the speed and efficiency? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2060.4s)]
*  Mostly. Or it will enhance it. But the real value in our industry comes [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2065.76s)]
*  from novelty and creating the best assets. If I'm a month faster than someone and I'm inferior, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2074.08s)]
*  ultimately clinicians shouldn't use my product. If I'm a month faster and superior, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2084.88s)]
*  I'm going to have a whole lot of use of that product. And I think what we're finding with [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2092.96s)]
*  these sort of technologies and why I think part of it, you go back to your course analogy, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2098.72s)]
*  Generative AI is a really interesting course in applying it to biology because the early signals [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2105.44s)]
*  and some of the early clinical programs and some of the next waves of clinical programs [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2112.64s)]
*  are suggesting that we're getting better answers than historical approaches enable. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2116.56s)]
*  And I think that's something that if you kind of just keep pulling that thread, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2123.44s)]
*  if you've got a capability that can give you differentiated products consistently, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2128.0s)]
*  that's a pretty exciting proposition to get behind. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2133.36s)]
*  Right now, I had a conversation with a guy a bit earlier today and I don't want to put words in [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2138.0s)]
*  his mouth so I'm not going to name it. But he was getting to a point around, we were talking about [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2143.84s)]
*  the impact of artificial intelligence and its early impact on molecular discovery. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2148.88s)]
*  And he kind of alluded to a point where he was kind of saying like, to change the paradigm, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2154.0800000000004s)]
*  you talked about it earlier, the cost and access paradigm, there needs to be more than faster, [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2160.1600000000003s)]
*  better molecular discovery because things get really tight and expensive, totally complex [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2167.04s)]
*  at the clinical level. So I guess the big picture, if you look at the impact of artificial [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2174.16s)]
*  intelligence and the way that you're using it to generate, how far along the continuum [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2180.24s)]
*  do you envision it making an impact on better and faster? [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2187.8399999999997s)]
*  I'll challenge that underlying premise but let me kind of just start with the end-to-end view. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2198.24s)]
*  Artificial intelligence, machine learning are tools. They're tools to apply to all parts of our [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2204.0s)]
*  lives. They will be applied to all parts of our lives. And all pieces of the drug discovery and [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2215.68s)]
*  development continuum will ultimately be transformed by these underlying technologies. Today, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2224.7999999999997s)]
*  we've found the sweet spot for our core company is in molecularism. We're starting to use it [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2232.2400000000002s)]
*  on target discovery approaches and we're thinking about how we can use data-driven, digitally native [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2241.36s)]
*  approaches in trial execution and some of the biomarker discovery. But I think in the future, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2249.12s)]
*  consistently, humans who embrace AI co-pilots are going to out-produce humans alone. And that will [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2265.2799999999997s)]
*  be true across all parts of all industries. That point brings up an interesting conversation [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2276.64s)]
*  that I've had many times with AI for biotechs. And that's this concept of, especially those who [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2285.6s)]
*  maybe were born pre-AI acceptance or understanding, I've had many conversations about the [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2293.04s)]
*  nuance of successful integration of traditional biology and computational biology at a physical [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2301.04s)]
*  level, at a personal level, at an intellectual property level. So tell me how you manage that [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2309.4399999999996s)]
*  to generate. Is there a challenge there or is it a situation where from the company's outset, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2316.9599999999996s)]
*  we're looking for these very open-minded biologists who have some computational skill [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2326.16s)]
*  or are you marrying two different disciplines and throw them in a room and make them sort it out? [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2332.08s)]
*  Our two co-founders who still are very active at the company, Molly Gibson and Gabor Grigorian, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2338.4s)]
*  both are computational scientists that have studied biology. So Gabor was a professor [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2343.6s)]
*  at Dartmouth in both computer science and biology departments. Molly was a PhD in [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2352.56s)]
*  computational systems biology from Washington University with a computer science undergrad degree. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2359.04s)]
*  These folks have done a brilliant job of creating an organization and an ethos as of [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2366.24s)]
*  an organization where our computational scientists are not in service of our [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2378.32s)]
*  experimentals. Our experimentals are not in service of our competition. We are [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2386.56s)]
*  collaborative across the domain and we embrace people who have that multidisciplinary training. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2390.88s)]
*  And the single biggest predictor of success within GENERATE is intellectual curiosity. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2398.48s)]
*  And people who are voracious learners who are interested in the domains that none of us [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2406.2400000000002s)]
*  are experts in every component of this complex maze that we call drug discovery, development, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  manufacturing, commercialization. We all are dependent on certain handoffs, but I think [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  the people that can stretch across multiple parts of this, these problems are really profound that [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2429.84s)]
*  we're trying to address. Biology is extraordinarily complex and unfortunately we've seen, while we've [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2436.6400000000003s)]
*  had a lot of organizations with extraordinary depth in individual disciplines, we've only made [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2443.04s)]
*  so much progress. Having people that can span these different domains, I think they're going to give [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2449.28s)]
*  us a different set of answers. It's not going to solve everything. No, no, but it certainly. I [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2453.84s)]
*  think about it in the context of like a three-year-old going on a four-year-old [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2459.04s)]
*  GENERATE had the company launched with the same mindset even three years earlier, much less 10 [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2464.32s)]
*  years earlier. That talent deficit that you talked about earlier would have been even more [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2471.2799999999997s)]
*  exacerbated in what you're doing. Are you seeing improvement in terms of replicating Mali and who [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2478.16s)]
*  else did you mention? Are you seeing improvement in replicating those skill sets down the line, [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2485.92s)]
*  not just at the founder level, but down the line? Coming out of academia? There were about 100 [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2492.8s)]
*  people in the world when I started at GENERATE that were skilled at the intersection of machine [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2498.08s)]
*  learning and protein engineering. We knew all 100 by name. It was a small niche community. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2501.76s)]
*  Good place to be for those folks. But you know where they actually all worked? [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2508.96s)]
*  DeepMind, Microsoft Research, Facebook, Salesforce, all had protein teams. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2516.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. And obviously some were within academia as well, but [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2523.2000000000003s)]
*  it wasn't a classical path of training. And market dynamics are very powerful. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2527.52s)]
*  Supply and demand dynamics are very powerful. Let's just say when tech enters into the bidding war [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2534.88s)]
*  for those types of talent, salaries and connotations change. And so there has been an influx [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2542.08s)]
*  of people that are now entering these areas to the point where our ML team had an internship [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2553.6s)]
*  program last year and we had five spots. We had 2,000 applications. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2564.48s)]
*  And these kids, I say kids because I'm just kidding, these young aspiring professionals [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2572.96s)]
*  that are interested in a position like that, are they coming, these 2,000 people coming to the [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2580.08s)]
*  the opportunity with like biology? PhD, machine learning, math, biology experience. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2585.12s)]
*  That's what I'm wondering. Is it if they're coming at it with that sort of scientific [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2594.08s)]
*  background and curiosity that you would require in an ideal world? [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2599.2799999999997s)]
*  And some of our team may just be brilliant mathematicians that are extraordinarily versatile. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2602.7999999999997s)]
*  Others will be extraordinary biologists with a natural predisposition toward computation. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2610.56s)]
*  Some are computer scientists that are very versatile. And so I don't think there's one [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2616.7999999999997s)]
*  single phenotype, but we're really fortunate to have some extraordinary people on our team. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2623.2s)]
*  You know, both our computational team and our experimental teams [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2633.36s)]
*  are filled with brilliant people. And even our experimentalists oftentimes have competition. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2638.7200000000003s)]
*  Because this doesn't work. You know, one of the things that has been super important from [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2646.2400000000002s)]
*  the inception of Generate was how do you view data? And unfortunately, in many organizations, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2651.76s)]
*  data is power. It's my experiment. I have the data. And you know, when you have a machine [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  learning approach, data has to be a collective asset. And you need an orientation on the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2672.08s)]
*  experimental side that recognizes that every data point is captured to refine the computational [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2679.52s)]
*  approach. And that is not your data. It's our data. Because the whole machine operates on that [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2686.88s)]
*  currency. And so there's a huge cultural piece that I think is really important for these companies [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2697.6s)]
*  that are starting at this intersection. And one of the debates I had for a long time with colleagues [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2704.08s)]
*  at Merck was, will it be the incumbents or the insurgents that actually crack this code? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2708.8s)]
*  And the incumbents have huge advantages, right? Whether you're an attack incumbent or you're a [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2713.8399999999997s)]
*  pharmaceutical incumbent, you know, if you're an attack, you have some of the best computational [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2719.2799999999997s)]
*  talent. You have extraordinary resources, right? If you're on the pharma side, you have some of [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2722.8799999999997s)]
*  the best biological talent in the world and extraordinary resources. What these insurgent [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2730.16s)]
*  organizations can do, though, is create a culture that actually blends the best of both worlds. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2736.56s)]
*  I think it's really, really important that in pharma, oftentimes the computational scientists [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2743.6800000000003s)]
*  are in service of the biologists. And in tech, if you have biologists, they're oftentimes in service [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2750.56s)]
*  of the technologists. In these sort of organizations, the ability to create alignment [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2757.6s)]
*  and kind of a parody that these two, it's a symbiotic relationship in many respects between [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2767.84s)]
*  the computational team and the experimental team. And that is something that I think has been [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2776.0s)]
*  really, really extraordinary to watch, to cultivate. And if you're an experimentalist [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2781.6800000000003s)]
*  and you don't subscribe to one of our five core values, it is around being digitally native. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2787.6s)]
*  And around how data has to be a collective asset. If you don't subscribe to that, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2794.72s)]
*  generally it's just not the right place for you. It doesn't mean you're a bad person. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2800.0s)]
*  When you say collective asset, I'm curious about your take on collective meaning, you know, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2804.08s)]
*  within the four walls, so to speak, of generate versus data being a collective asset to [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2809.3599999999997s)]
*  the industry and where the lines fall. And I'm sure it's probably both, right? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2816.16s)]
*  But how do you, like when you look at it from an industry-wide perspective, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2826.56s)]
*  open source data, probably a valid data, which is incredibly important. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2831.6s)]
*  How does that kind of shake out in terms of generates approach to differentiation [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2837.7599999999998s)]
*  and competition? When the company was started, the ratio of public to proprietary data, obviously, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2841.92s)]
*  was one to zero. It's all public. And the reason generics was actually founded to solve the protein [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2849.6800000000003s)]
*  challenge in some respects was because there were two extraordinary public data sets. One was the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2857.04s)]
*  sequencing revolution has given us 180 million amino acid sequences across all species. And then [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2863.28s)]
*  number two, the structural biology community gave us an extraordinary database called the protein [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2870.24s)]
*  data bank where 200,000 high quality, high resolution structures of proteins were exceptionally [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2876.64s)]
*  well curated. And what that allowed me to start to do is establish the inner relationship between [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2883.6s)]
*  protein sequence and protein structure. And if you think about technologies like AlphaFlo from [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2890.24s)]
*  DeepMind, those in some ways were trained on these two data sets. So the ability to go from [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2896.96s)]
*  a sequence to a structure is a prediction challenge, right? And if I started to understand [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2903.12s)]
*  those two data sets, I started to make predictions around different sequences and different [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2907.04s)]
*  structure, structural or holding patterns. January was always oriented toward adding a third leg to [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2911.68s)]
*  the stool. As a therapeutics company, sequence and structure are interesting. Function is where the [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2919.36s)]
*  business is, right? We care about how proteins interact, how they drive biological function. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2927.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, there is no public database of function. And there's a [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2936.08s)]
*  number of inherent limitations in the industry to create a kind of an open source functional database. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2944.96s)]
*  Primary among them is inherent variability of measurements. So if you were to run an assay and [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2954.48s)]
*  I were to run an assay in different labs, we may get different values. And as we all know, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2960.88s)]
*  with machine learning based technologies, the quality of data is paramount. Garbage in, garbage [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2969.28s)]
*  out. So part of what we've tried to do within the company is create proprietary data sets [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  of extraordinarily well curated data. We use a lot of automation. We use miniaturization techniques, [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2982.32s)]
*  microfluidics to do experiments at greater volumes so that when we run experiments, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=2993.36s)]
*  we want to collect as much data as possible. And that's allowed the company over the course of the [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3002.4s)]
*  last five years to go from a starting point of a hundred examples to an individual experiment [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3008.32s)]
*  to the biggest experiment we've now run as a million defined variants. And every one of those [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3016.4s)]
*  data points, either biophysical measurement or functional measurement are captured and fed back [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3021.2s)]
*  to refine the computational approach. And so we've now generated sequences built into full length [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3029.4399999999996s)]
*  proteins and tested around 5 million proteins and all of that data now is informing our models. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3036.3199999999997s)]
*  And that's helping us now to understand what does it mean to go from a protein [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3044.0s)]
*  to a drug? Key parameters, affinity, how tightly do I bind to the target? Potency, [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3051.2s)]
*  immunogenicity, all of the manufacturability and developability parameters that are really important, [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3060.56s)]
*  those are things that are measured to actually help inform our modeling to say, how do I optimize [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3067.6s)]
*  to go from protein to optimal therapeutic as quickly as possible. And so [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3073.9199999999996s)]
*  the data sets are accumulating and there are major data gaps that we still see that we're making [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3080.96s)]
*  either sizable investments ourselves or we're looking to partner. And on the internal investment, [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3087.28s)]
*  we've made an investment in cryo-EM microscopes. So these are four, we have four cutting edge, [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3095.68s)]
*  world-class, high resolution cryo-EM microscopes. The reason we bought those were [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3102.48s)]
*  in that protein data bank of the 200,000 high quality, high resolution structures that I mentioned, [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3108.88s)]
*  only about 2000 are protein-protein interactions. Most of them are pre-sanded proteins. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3114.88s)]
*  And in medicine or in the pursuit of medicines, you want the interaction. You want to understand [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3122.16s)]
*  what residues are driving function in that antibody antigen interaction. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3131.36s)]
*  And we decided that let's figure out how to supplement that data set because that data is [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3136.72s)]
*  really valuable for our models. On the other side, there's a whole array of data that we're still [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3143.04s)]
*  very data-poor as a company and as an industry. Part of why we did the partnership we have with [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3149.04s)]
*  MD Anderson, MD Anderson Cancer Center, one of the world's busiest cancer centers and sees as many [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3155.68s)]
*  patients at any center in the United States, was we wanted to have understandings of the drivers [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3162.64s)]
*  of certain cancer types. We understood that at a foundational level, our technology would allow us [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3169.44s)]
*  to drug those targets. And it's been a great partnership because it brings the data from a [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3177.8399999999997s)]
*  world-renowned organization with our unique capability to create medicines for patients and [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3186.6400000000003s)]
*  hopefully get better medicines to patients faster. I've been trying to learn about spatial biology. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3191.84s)]
*  Yeah. Right? Like this is a new trend. But is that spatial biology? Are you guys, is that part of the [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3196.88s)]
*  play here? Maybe if not, we'll just move on. Not a huge part, but I mean, listen, we combine all [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3202.96s)]
*  components of these sort of technologies. The reality is that we're not just talking about [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3209.1200000000003s)]
*  technologies. The reality for us is when we step back and we think about [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3214.48s)]
*  the opportunity that sits before us, there are these data sets that you rightly point out that [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3222.3199999999997s)]
*  are missing. Ultimately, what we're trying to do is be able to master sequence to function [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3226.8799999999997s)]
*  in a relationship. Because if I know the sequence to function in a relationship, [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3237.92s)]
*  what that allows me to do is program. I can sit there and type in the code to drive the desired [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3245.76s)]
*  function. And that's what, if you think about like this, the real long-term massive transformation [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3255.76s)]
*  is taking drug discovery from the artisanal craft that it is today and making biology engineer. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3265.6s)]
*  Yeah. Making a program. Yeah. And we're on a path toward that. [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3272.24s)]
*  We've spent a lot of time talking to you about AI, and that's good. You're giving great concrete [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3281.92s)]
*  examples of the work ChinaAID is doing. I'm curious about your take on the investor appetite [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3286.8799999999997s)]
*  for it because there's no doubt a high curve, right? There's a high curve going on right now. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3293.12s)]
*  For the past three years, we've been talking about investor discernment. We've got all these [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3299.68s)]
*  reasons to be discerning. To your point, why? I don't want to invest in you. AI is one of those [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3304.96s)]
*  things that I feel like there are so many companies that are riding that high curve right now. That's [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3313.7599999999998s)]
*  an area where investors should be discerned. If you come at a conference like this and you say, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3318.4s)]
*  well, machine learning and AI, let's pull back covers and have a closer look. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3324.1600000000003s)]
*  So give me some color around how, if you're speaking to the investment community, which you [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3331.52s)]
*  are, I get a lot of VCs listening to those, how they should be discerning from reality around [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3338.08s)]
*  artificial intelligence, oral words, biotechs right now. I always start with the people. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3345.2s)]
*  I carefully scrutinize the team of the organization that we would potentially work with, partner with. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3353.7599999999998s)]
*  The people. Don't look at, well, we've got an app or we're outsourcing to a... [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3361.7599999999998s)]
*  Look at the individuals that are actually driving it. Technology. And are these folks among [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3368.96s)]
*  the world-class contingent in those domains? I look at the publications that they've done, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3376.48s)]
*  either while they're within their organizations or in prior lives, to understand the quality [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3385.04s)]
*  of their science. We recently published one of our models. It's a model called Chroma. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3392.72s)]
*  And it was in Nature. So when people ask me, how do I know the quality of your machine learning? [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3399.2799999999997s)]
*  You can see the Nature publication. Have a read at it. And you'll see that it's a very [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3409.2s)]
*  you know, have a read at it. And you'll see, we're really blessed with [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3418.3199999999997s)]
*  an extraordinary team of machine learning scientists. I think then, you obviously have to [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3426.56s)]
*  look at the technology as well, because it's great to have great people, but if they're not translating [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3434.3199999999997s)]
*  that into a technology that's really meaningful. And then the technology though, or the concept, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3438.7999999999997s)]
*  I think, you know, we can all use the same words. The question then becomes the translatability. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3446.32s)]
*  And you know, what I ultimately want to be judged by is the output. Are we creating better drugs [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3453.36s)]
*  than we could have otherwise? And you know, there are going to be a series of interim markers until [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3462.32s)]
*  we hit the real marker. Do these drugs make a difference in patients' lives? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3467.68s)]
*  And that is, you know, the definition of success that I aspire to, that Generate aspires to, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3473.36s)]
*  because of the nasancy of some of these technologies. We're just early in that journey. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3481.2000000000003s)]
*  And I think, unfortunately, sometimes the long lead times in pharmaceutical discovery and development [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3487.84s)]
*  obscure progress, or the view of progress. Right? The revolution is happening right now. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3494.88s)]
*  The outcome of that revolution, given the regulatory paradigm that we have in front of us, [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3503.36s)]
*  is maybe a decade away. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3512.0800000000004s)]
*  That long lead time, you anticipate that that lead time will remain in the interim? [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3513.92s)]
*  I know. I think we collapsed clinical trials under the current FDA guidance in the very short term. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3521.44s)]
*  So we're getting to clinical trials quicker. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3527.6000000000004s)]
*  We're getting to clinical trials quicker. I mean, you're taking, you know, a 10 to 15 year [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3529.76s)]
*  process, cutting off a couple of years, you know, to get to clinical trials quicker. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3533.52s)]
*  You're cutting off a couple of years. Ideally and theoretically, you should be getting to [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3540.48s)]
*  better answers with changes in probabilities. But again, we're going to have to wait time to judge [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3548.0s)]
*  that. I think, you know, will there be opportunities for further compression? Absolutely. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3553.2000000000003s)]
*  Will we find ways of compressing the clinical trial dynamics? I believe so. I believe both [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3562.32s)]
*  there'll be better free clinical models and ways of enriching clinical trials to do that better. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3567.6s)]
*  But, you know, the nature of our business right now, you know, is, you know, that is the path that [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3573.6s)]
*  we have to take. And these technologies should be held to the same level of scrutiny as, you know, [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3583.52s)]
*  a technology that was discovered through more traditional means. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3590.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I'll look in your crystal ball, right? Questions. Everyone hates that to answer. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3594.2400000000002s)]
*  How long before you and I are sitting here having a conversation about the impact of these [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3603.44s)]
*  technologies on clinical trials? Because that is at the inflection point that we're at right now [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3608.16s)]
*  in terms of its impact on molecular discovery and design. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3614.7200000000003s)]
*  I think we're going to start to see impact over the next few years. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3618.96s)]
*  Yeah. I think we'll look back in the very near future, and these technologies will be pervasive [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3622.32s)]
*  in everything we do. Yeah. Right. I mean, you know, we're just learning how to interact [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3632.96s)]
*  with the chat GPT's. Do you have any concerns? [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3639.84s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Of course. I mean, these are extraordinarily powerful tools. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3643.6000000000004s)]
*  But we already have some pretty extraordinarily powerful tools. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3651.84s)]
*  These are just something we're interested with. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3656.08s)]
*  That's right. And so, you know, I mean, like, all of these things have to be [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3657.92s)]
*  pursued with due caution and due consideration. But, you know, the reality is, I think the good [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3662.48s)]
*  outweighs the concerns in a pretty massive way. You know, for us, you know, it's interesting. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3669.28s)]
*  You know, one of the things that people are saying to me all the time is like, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3676.6400000000003s)]
*  well, Mike, how do you deal with the hallucinations of generative AI? [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3679.44s)]
*  Well, in a construct where you have this tight integration of dry and wet lab, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3684.2400000000002s)]
*  we experimentally validate everything. So the hallucinations actually are enormously [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3689.84s)]
*  powerful for our modeling. Because it helps you. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3696.64s)]
*  Yeah, because we learn. Right. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3700.32s)]
*  We learn from failure in a way that the industry's never learned from failure. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3702.32s)]
*  And if the model is ultimately hallucinating, that protein doesn't express and it doesn't work. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3706.7200000000003s)]
*  And that data is already fed back. Right. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3712.96s)]
*  And so it helps us get to a better answer faster. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3715.6s)]
*  Yeah. And, you know, those sort of bugs are [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3718.48s)]
*  actually features in many respects in this sort of world where you're experimentally validating. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3721.04s)]
*  I think if you're just thinking that computation is going to solve everything, [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3726.48s)]
*  you know, I greatly discount organizations in biology that think computational solver. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3730.32s)]
*  Our, you know, our workforce is skewed. You know, everyone considers us an AI ML [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3740.6400000000003s)]
*  drug discovery company. Our workforce is skewed toward experimentalists. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3745.6000000000004s)]
*  We have about two thirds of our workforce that are experimentalists. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3752.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And that's just because we have to validate. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3756.4s)]
*  We have to measure. We have to generate the data. [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3760.0800000000004s)]
*  The only way to do that is through experimentation. To do it reliably. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3762.8s)]
*  And so, you know, for us, certainly in the short medium, and I'd say medium to long term, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3769.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, the paucity of data, functional data, the data that we really care about [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3776.4s)]
*  across a number of domains in life sciences will lead us to a place where, you know, we are [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3785.92s)]
*  constantly needing more and more information to refine these computational approaches to [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3795.28s)]
*  get to the best answers as fast as possible. Yeah. That's fascinating. And I'm curious about [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3799.76s)]
*  where you are, if you want to share some information on where you are right now and [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3805.92s)]
*  what the next step might be for generating. Yeah. Well, I mean, excitingly, our first two [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3809.92s)]
*  molecules entered the clinic in 2023. You know, that is a major milestone for any company. And, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3816.32s)]
*  you know, we're extraordinarily proud that, you know, we're now starting to see the benefits [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3826.08s)]
*  you know, in people. And, you know, those programs we think could, you know, address [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3832.08s)]
*  areas, major areas of medical need behind it, though we have roughly 20 programs. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3839.76s)]
*  A number of those are in partnership. So we have six in partnership with Amgen. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3846.48s)]
*  I mentioned the MD Anderson partnership where we're now working on three different targets. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3850.7200000000003s)]
*  We're working with Roswell Park Cancer Center on a number of other targets. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3854.16s)]
*  And then we have an internal pipeline for generate, you know, around eight to 10 programs [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3861.44s)]
*  that we're working on from a proprietary standpoint. And so, you know, we're in this [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3867.44s)]
*  transitional state of an organization where, you know, for the first few years, we were really [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3871.92s)]
*  a pure technology company. We were developing a technology. Now we're kind of morphing into [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3876.7200000000003s)]
*  a technology company that discovers drugs and that develops drugs. And so, you know, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3886.96s)]
*  you're seeing a bit of a transformation within the organization to bring in some of the skills [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3894.88s)]
*  and capabilities. I think, you know, from a business, you know, building the organization, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3900.32s)]
*  that creates some interesting cultural dynamics we're working through. But, you know, clearly we [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3905.92s)]
*  need, you know, the experience of seasoned drug hunters and drug developers with the pioneering [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3912.88s)]
*  spirit of the original technology developers. And so it's something that we spend a lot of time, [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3922.88s)]
*  you know, thinking through. And then, you know, from a technology perspective, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3928.2400000000002s)]
*  we're scratching the surface of application. I always say to the team, like, the one thing I [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3932.4s)]
*  know definitively is I don't know the best use of the technology at this point. I know there are [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3938.72s)]
*  multiple, multi-billion dollar applications for the technology, but where this will have the [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3945.6s)]
*  greatest impact on humanity, we're still searching. And that leads to a bit of a dynamic where you're [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3952.08s)]
*  constantly balancing kind of exploration and exploitation, right? So when you find those [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3959.68s)]
*  areas where we can make impact, how do we do more of those versus expanding the aperture? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3965.84s)]
*  The technology is protein modality agnostic. So it works for us antibodies, peptides, enzymes, [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3972.4s)]
*  cell, gene therapy, all have protein. It's the ADCs, bispecifics. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3978.88s)]
*  That's a good place to be. Right. So you have a ton of real estate to cover. Which of these will [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3985.44s)]
*  have, which of those domains will we have greatest advantage over traditional approaches? [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3992.64s)]
*  We're still learning. My guess is it's going to be a more complex biology. If you think about [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=3997.7599999999998s)]
*  where computers routinely outperform humans, it's in complex multi-pronged optimization. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4005.68s)]
*  And the more complex the biological construct in many respects, I think the computer ultimately [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4013.68s)]
*  will show inherent advantage. So those sort of challenges as we go forward are super [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4021.44s)]
*  interesting. And you're trying to do that while you're trying to execute on these clinical [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4030.16s)]
*  programs, bring the next generation of programs to the fore and developing a technology that [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4033.68s)]
*  I believe will ultimately change the way the whole industry creates large molecules. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4039.68s)]
*  And I don't say that lightly. We can debate how long that may be. But I think it's inevitable [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4047.84s)]
*  that over time, these sort of approaches will provide a foundationally better way of coming [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4057.28s)]
*  up with the right answer than the traditional artisanal approach. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4067.92s)]
*  Well, I know we're running short on time here, so I can ask you questions well into the evening. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4072.32s)]
*  But I'm curious about one of the things you mentioned is sort of the cultural change [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4078.2400000000002s)]
*  generated into a drug development company, not away from a tech, but being built on a technology [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4084.08s)]
*  company. And I'm curious about how, if you're doing that, if you're leading a company that's [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4089.04s)]
*  doing that on an island, sort of unto itself, the challenge it occurs to me might be more daunting [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4094.0s)]
*  than it would be for flagship pioneering partner CEO. How much support, how advantageous is it for [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4100.32s)]
*  you? I'm not insinuating that perhaps you're sniping drug development talent from other [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4108.16s)]
*  flagship companies, but how advantageous is it for you to kind of be part of that ecosystem? [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4113.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, listen, it's a special ecosystem. What flagships have been able to build is really [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4118.4s)]
*  extraordinary. And it's not for the faint of heart. Most innovation occurs in an incremental fashion. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4125.36s)]
*  Most innovation from most organizations is around the edges. Flagship lives in the white spaces. And [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4134.88s)]
*  even the name of the organization is highly symbolic. Flagship Pioneering. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4144.4s)]
*  Yeah. A lot of the time we spend thinking about is what does it mean to be a pioneer? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  What does it mean to push into new areas, frontiers? How do you orient and how do you make it [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4157.52s)]
*  inhabitable for other settlers? How do you keep pushing boundaries? Right. The immigrant mentality. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4168.0s)]
*  Every time I talk about the flagship. Absolutely. And I think one of the other things that we spend [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4175.52s)]
*  a lot of time thinking about are kind of dualities of leadership. Oftentimes, we think about [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4181.68s)]
*  the world in black and white terms. And everyone says, well, no, let's live in the gray [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4190.400000000001s)]
*  zone. Oftentimes, what we believe is that you need polar experience. You need to be [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4197.360000000001s)]
*  able to balance between the two poles, not in between. And it's those sort of mindsets that I [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4204.48s)]
*  think become super valuable in these sort of domains. You probably have heard New Bar talk [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4210.959999999999s)]
*  about paranoid optimism. That's one of those dualities. Sometimes we need to be paranoid. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4220.32s)]
*  Oftentimes, we need to be optimistic. And how do you, rather than kind of sitting there in between, [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4227.12s)]
*  how do we embrace both of the poles as we develop these sort of organizations? And so certainly, [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4233.36s)]
*  it's really nice when you're doing things that people haven't done before. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4242.0s)]
*  And you have guides that have been on similar journeys that can help you understand from their [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4249.5199999999995s)]
*  own experiences. And the TMet flagship, as I mentioned, Stefan, who is a member of the board, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4256.8s)]
*  who's created obviously Moderna, they've been huge, I think, teachers for me, for the TMet [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4266.64s)]
*  Generate, sharing their experiences in a very open, transparent way. And most importantly, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4276.64s)]
*  not just the successes, but the failures. So we oftentimes talk a lot about what went well, [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4283.28s)]
*  but you sometimes learn the most from the mistakes that organizations make on these sort of journeys. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4292.719999999999s)]
*  Sure. We stated in the outset that failure is inherent, and if you're not taking it away from [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4299.44s)]
*  that, then it's on you. That's right. You're losing. And the TMet flagship, Nubar, Jeff, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4306.08s)]
*  that were kind of the founding team of Generate, have been extraordinary mentors, ambassadors, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4315.92s)]
*  teachers, guides, as we've gone on this journey. And for someone that is coming from a big company, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4326.8s)]
*  doing this for the first time, being able to surround myself with those sort of people, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4334.24s)]
*  and a whole cohort of other CEO partners that are also doing this journey for the first time, [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4340.88s)]
*  with an array of different backgrounds, that's an enormous asset. Because as you know, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4347.4400000000005s)]
*  and you talk to a lot of folks in these sort of roles, these roles can be really lonely. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4353.6s)]
*  Lonely. And having that sort of ecosystem to pull upon is a huge, huge value. And it gives you [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4359.360000000001s)]
*  a sense of calm in massive places of uncertainty. And I'm enormously grateful for that. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4369.12s)]
*  Well, I'm enormously grateful for you taking time out of this busy week to spend with me [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4377.92s)]
*  on the Business Biotech. So I really appreciate it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4382.56s)]
*  I'm Matt Piller, and you just listened to the Business of Biotech, the weekly podcast dedicated [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYuzT7of3D8&t=4385.2s)]
