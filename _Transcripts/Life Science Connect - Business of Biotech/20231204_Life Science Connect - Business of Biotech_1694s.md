Video Description: Combined Therapeutics President & CEO Dr. Romain Micol is operating his company in a very noisy space, where hundreds of new biotechs have popped up on the coattails of a COVID-driven renewal of interest in mRNA vaccines. Micol recognizes that noise and the competition it brings for capital and mindshare. He's not only aware of it â€” he welcomes it. On this quick episode of the Business of Biotech podcast, Micol shares the unique approach Combined Tx is taking to distinguish itself in the mRNA infectious disease and cancer vaccine space, from the delivery, safety, efficacy, and business perspectives.

*  work he's doing to lead combined therapeutics through the white-hot mRNA vaccine and therapeutic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=70.16s)]
*  space. Dr. Micholl, welcome to the show, and thanks for joining us. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=75.2s)]
*  Hello, Matt. Thank you very much. It's nice to speak with you today. Thank you again. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=80.48s)]
*  Oh, it's great to speak with you too. And I make this sort of joke about your academic accolades [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=85.84s)]
*  reading like alphabet soup, but it's a joke that I mean in a good-hearted manner. I tell my kids [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=91.6s)]
*  all the time, Romain, I tell them all the time, academic achievement and accolades equate to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  optionality. You know, like they give you optionality further down the road in life. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=102.8s)]
*  So I'm curious, I want to start there because I'm curious about like whether you were, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=107.6s)]
*  whether you considered yourself a degree in accolade collector, or if you were looking for, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=111.36s)]
*  or if you were looking for optionality, or if there was a method to your, you know, your, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=117.12s)]
*  I guess your academic strategy. Yeah, I think there is certainly some strategy in that academic, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  I think, but I'm passionate. And I guess I started with my, with my medical degree [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=129.36s)]
*  and specialization in infectious diseases. And I think the PhD bring you a lot of, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=137.12s)]
*  of serious in terms of science when you want to manage a biotech company. And yes, and the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=144.56s)]
*  optionality to learn about finance during the MBA is also a great tool to raise capital and [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=151.6s)]
*  manage also safely your company with different finance and planning tool. And I think a degree [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=159.84s)]
*  that was very, very nice and helped me a lot to manage combined therapeutics. It was the LLM at [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=167.28s)]
*  the London School of Economics to better understand intellectual property. So it's a very, very [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=174.24s)]
*  interesting area to learn when you want to manage your business in the biotech field. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=179.68s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, for sure. I'm curious about your, the transition from, from academia and practicing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=185.6s)]
*  medicine to the business side of biotechnology. What, what was your first foray into, like you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=195.12s)]
*  said, that LLM degree, you know, benefited the MBA sort of set you up in some ways from an academic [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=202.08s)]
*  perspective for biotech business leadership. What was the, I guess, motivation to move away from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=208.24s)]
*  academia and practicing medicine into the business side? Yeah, so, so I had a transition in, in, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=214.16s)]
*  in pharma company to learn about pharma company and how to manage, how to participate to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=222.0s)]
*  R&D program and then integrating the business development unit of that company. And that, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=228.88s)]
*  and the transition I made was particularly also to learn working at the international level. And I [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=235.60000000000002s)]
*  had the opportunity to learn, to work and learn from, from different countries such as USA, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=244.08s)]
*  India and China. And then I think I got really the, the, the passion and the entrepreneurship [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=253.12s)]
*  to develop my own companies with, with particular, particularly very great co-founders. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=263.6s)]
*  What was the, the hardest part about that transition moving from, you know, sort of [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=272.0s)]
*  an academic approach to medicine to, to the business part? Well, you know, I, I think the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=277.6s)]
*  other, the other part was really to, to stop practicing medicine and seeing patients because [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=284.24s)]
*  that's something I love. And, and, but then, you know, it's, it's a second life, new, new, new, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=292.72s)]
*  new challenges. And that's very exciting too. Yeah. Yeah. What were some of the things like for, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=301.36s)]
*  if you were going to advise people who are sort of in that same position, right? Like transitioning [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=309.20000000000005s)]
*  from academic careers or practicing careers into the business side, what, what advice would [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=316.0s)]
*  you give them in terms of making that adaptation? One of the, from my view and my personal view, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=322.64s)]
*  one of the most important advice would be to, to keep, to keep your passion, to, to keep your [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=334.08s)]
*  passion, to keep your wish to bring to the patient better treatment, to improve their quality of life. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=343.84s)]
*  And that's something that drives my personal development when I was practicing in hospital. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=352.0s)]
*  And I kept that same goal in terms of achievement for other, when I started combined therapeutics, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=360.32s)]
*  is to bring to population a better vaccine, to bring to cancer patient, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=366.96s)]
*  better immunotherapy to treat their cancer. And that's what has driven my, my [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=374.4s)]
*  excitation to start a new business. Yeah. And I think when, when, when you, when you keep as [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=384.32s)]
*  the main objective to bring, to bring better medicines to the patient, to the population, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=392.0s)]
*  you, you always federate investors and keep people to work with you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=400.16s)]
*  Yeah. It's and I'm going to ask you some questions about the, the formation of combined here in just [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=408.16s)]
*  a minute, but one more stop on your career journey that I want to dig into a little bit. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=413.28s)]
*  Like I said, like I said, from the outset, like I wondered if this, you know, this unique mix of [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=418.16s)]
*  degrees was strategic. Another stop on your career journey that I wonder if it was strategic was [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=423.68s)]
*  while you were at Transgene, you were there from 2010 to 2015 and you made the move from [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=429.6s)]
*  international scientific program manager to director of business development. And when you [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=435.44s)]
*  look at that, I mean, when you look at that on paper, you're like, wow, that's quite, quite a [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=440.64000000000004s)]
*  switch. So, so tell me about why you made that move into biz dev and how it, how it helped you. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=443.68s)]
*  That's yeah. I mean, it was, it was a very great opportunity from, from the company. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=449.12s)]
*  And for me that the company gave me to transition from a certificate and R&D position [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=456.88s)]
*  to a BD marketing activities and position. But it was, it was very, very full for me to understand [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=464.4s)]
*  how for my future business, by the way, how the R&D transition to a, to a BD, to a product [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=473.84000000000003s)]
*  development, because that's not the same, absolutely not the same work and that's not the same challenges. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=481.36s)]
*  So, so it was, it was very, very exciting to transition from science to the marketing and the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  business. And that experience was, was very important for me to better start combined [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=495.44s)]
*  therapeutics in 2016. Yeah. I can only imagine that when you started combined therapeutics, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=503.12s)]
*  coming into it with sort of that whole brain approach is an advantage. I think there are a [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=508.56s)]
*  lot of scientific founders who may lack some of that, you know, market facing kind of business [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=513.84s)]
*  experience. So I can see where that would be advantageous. So maybe, maybe the takeaway is [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=519.84s)]
*  for the, you know, the scientific listeners among our audience to consider a BD role, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=524.32s)]
*  at least for a little while to gain that experience. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. That's very powerful. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=529.36s)]
*  Yeah. All right. So combined, tell us, tell us the origin story. How did you come to co-found [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  this company with, with Robert Langer and Dan Anderson back in 2016? Yeah. So the, the, the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=542.96s)]
*  story of, of combined therapeutics in 2016 was to potentially, because it was really a vision at [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=551.92s)]
*  that time, without any scientific proof of concept to offer potentially to the patient, some [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=560.8s)]
*  therapeutic mRNA that will announce, I don't want to enter too much into the scientific detail, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  but that will announce some viral therapy. You know, viral therapy is like a virus that attack [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=575.84s)]
*  the tumor. And we, at that time, we, we were expecting, hoping to develop therapeutic mRNA [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=583.84s)]
*  to announce the virus that will attack the cancer, to have better viral therapy and immunotherapy [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=592.08s)]
*  products to treat cancer patients. That's the story of combined therapeutics. And we, we achieved [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=598.08s)]
*  in 2019, great proof of concept and, and then the company, because that's the business also [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=606.5600000000001s)]
*  of any biotech company to, to potentially evolve and, and, and show and change their, their [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=613.9200000000001s)]
*  objectives. We, we, I decided as CEO of combined therapeutics to, to apply what we learn from [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=621.2s)]
*  viral therapy and cancer to potentially develop better mRNA vaccine. And then the, the, the company [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=630.72s)]
*  has changed. The board has, has, has, has, has, has been, got some new board member and we decided [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=639.36s)]
*  to, to launch an activity around mRNA vaccine. And we, what we learned, sorry, I'm repeating myself, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=651.04s)]
*  what we learned from the cancer treatment for viral therapy on kinetic virus has been applied, [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=657.76s)]
*  a similar approach to the vaccine. It's totally two different worlds. There is no connection, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=665.68s)]
*  but when you success in one domain and particularly in an emerging biotech, and you believe that your [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=671.76s)]
*  team will, will accomplish a similar level of success in another field that is completely [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=679.36s)]
*  booming, and that's the mRNA vaccine in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic, you have to try when you [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=685.52s)]
*  are CEO. And it's what we try to combine therapeutics and the team has successfully [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=691.76s)]
*  developed a new generation of mRNA vaccine for infectious disease and for cancer. And we are [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=696.56s)]
*  now moving from pre-clinical development to clinical development next year. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=702.88s)]
*  Yeah. That, but just to, just to clarify, I want to make sure that I'm tracking [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=707.12s)]
*  correctly here that your, your mRNA work began pre-COVID pandemic, correct? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=711.12s)]
*  Pre-COVID pandemic. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  Pre-COVID pandemic. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=720.32s)]
*  Three concern with immunotherapy. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=720.6400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=722.48s)]
*  Yeah. You know, there are a lot of, a lot of startup companies that jumped on the mRNA bandwagon post [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  COVID pandemic for obvious reasons that we don't need to get into. So, you know, throwing your [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=729.7600000000001s)]
*  mind back in time pre-COVID pandemic, give us a little more light, shed a little more light on why [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=735.36s)]
*  at that time before, I mean, obviously, you know, we know mRNA therapeutics and vaccines were in [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=742.0s)]
*  development for a long time before the pandemic. And that just really shone a bright spotlight on [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=747.2s)]
*  that space. But why was mRNA your platform of choice at that time, even before it began to [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=752.24s)]
*  prove itself in a meaningful way in the COVID era? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=761.12s)]
*  So, okay. So why we choose the mRNA platform in 2016? That's your question. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yep. Yeah. You, you, you simplified my, you may, you simplified my question, [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=771.76s)]
*  but that's the heart of it. Yes. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=776.88s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I mean, you, you know, we know that nucleic acid therapies are a very versatile [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=779.52s)]
*  platform. And a lot of companies since said few decades tried to, to work on DNA. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=790.8s)]
*  The, the, but the DNA technology has some, has some main challenge in term of, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=799.76s)]
*  in term of manufacturing stability and in term also on potential integration in your genome. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=805.68s)]
*  So some companies in the early 20s and then in 2010 with, with Moderna, BioNTech, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=814.64s)]
*  TransfedBio has developed the mRNA and has applied the knowledge the scientists has developed [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=824.4s)]
*  on DNA to the mRNA with the particularity of the mRNA, of course. And, and the reason is mRNA are [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=833.68s)]
*  much more easier to produce and, and, and, and it's changed everything. And certainly in term of [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=843.2s)]
*  integration to your genome, there is much less risk with mRNA compared to DNA. So for safety, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=857.36s)]
*  efficacy, manufacturing purpose, the, the mRNA in term of, in, in the umbrella of nucleic acid [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=865.04s)]
*  therapy was really the technology, a very attractive to, to, to develop. And, and that [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=873.92s)]
*  technology can also answer cancer treatment and vaccine. So it has a huge versatility. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=881.28s)]
*  And that's the reason I think that the mRNA technology is a huge success today. Even there [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=892.8s)]
*  is room for improvement. Otherwise in medicine, that's a great technology. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=899.28s)]
*  Therapies based on messenger RNA offer many manufacturing advantages over traditional [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=907.84s)]
*  biologics, including cost, speed, and flexibility. On the Business of Biotech podcast, we delve into [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=912.88s)]
*  all things related to mRNA manufacturing, from making mRNA vaccines to their scale up, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=919.76s)]
*  regulatory approval, and more. The pod is brought to you in collaboration with Cytiva, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=925.6s)]
*  a global provider of technologies and services that advance and accelerate the development, [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=930.96s)]
*  manufacture, and delivery of therapeutics, including mRNA production and manufacturing. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=935.6s)]
*  Check out their resources. It's Cytiva.com backslash emerging biotech. That's C-Y-T-I-V-A.com [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=941.44s)]
*  backslash emerging biotech. It occurs to me that a company that was playing in the space, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=949.36s)]
*  doing good work and development in the space prior to the COVID pandemic. And as I said, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=959.0400000000001s)]
*  the onslaught of follow-on companies adopting mRNA as a platform. There are hundreds now, [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=965.36s)]
*  there are hundreds globally of emerging companies that are working on mRNA therapeutic and vaccine [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=973.12s)]
*  development. I imagine from your perspective, there had to come a point there where you went, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=980.9599999999999s)]
*  being a veteran in the space, like a company that had been playing in the space for quite some time, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=986.48s)]
*  there had to come a point where you were like, oh boy, oh boy, here we go. Here comes the [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=992.8s)]
*  competition. Here comes the crowd. And I say competition, not just from a therapeutic [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=996.9599999999999s)]
*  standpoint, but from a fundraising standpoint and from a noise in the marketplace standpoint. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1001.76s)]
*  So what are your thoughts there? When you saw this space balloon the way that it has? [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1007.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, competition is good. I think it's something that pushes you to develop and to assess [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1013.76s)]
*  your own challenges. So I think it's a good thing to have competition. Yes, I guess in [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1024.48s)]
*  terms of fundraising, it's certainly diluting the potential capacity to raise cash, but you know, [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1036.4s)]
*  at the end of the story, sophisticated investors invest according to the portfolio they have. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1043.76s)]
*  They try to de-risk to diversify their portfolio. So when you have the good technology, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1054.4s)]
*  that means you have generated good science and you have also a strong IP position. It's where [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1062.08s)]
*  some competitors can lose the race. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1072.16s)]
*  Yeah. So tell us a little bit more about that, the, I guess, competitive differentiation [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1078.0800000000002s)]
*  at Combined. What are you doing to distinguish yourself in this crowd? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1084.48s)]
*  So we have developed a unique technology at Combined Therapeutics because, you know, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1089.52s)]
*  a messenger RNA, to simplify the description, the messenger RNA is delivered with a lipid nanoparticle. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1099.6s)]
*  And today, what we believe at Combined Therapeutics is the need to develop better vaccine based on an [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1111.28s)]
*  improved bio-distribution and also based on an higher potency compared to the current mRNA vaccine, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1119.76s)]
*  both for infectious disease and cancer. To answer the better bio-distribution profile, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1126.4s)]
*  there is two, I would say, two different approaches. The first one is to work on the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1132.32s)]
*  excipient, that's the lipid nanoparticle that protects the mRNA. That's a lot of CDMO are trying [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1137.6s)]
*  to optimize or improve their lipid nanoparticle. That's not what we are doing at Combined. At [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1146.48s)]
*  Combined, we are modifying the mRNA, the mRNA is a very simple, very simple, very simple, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1153.36s)]
*  at Combined, we are modifying the mRNA to allow the mRNA or to instill the mRNA to produce the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1159.36s)]
*  vaccine in some part of the body and by definition, the muscle at the site of injection and to inhibit [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1169.1999999999998s)]
*  the mRNA translation or the vaccine production in your periferic organ. So currently, the mRNA [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  vaccine has a broad bio-distribution. It's publicly available information and our technology [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1187.92s)]
*  is focusing purely on the mRNA vaccine part, on the modification of the mRNA sequence. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  And we have a strong IP position on that technology. It's where we are blocking [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1201.76s)]
*  competitor to enter in that domain of technology. What does that mean in terms of the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1207.76s)]
*  delivery vehicle? So are you saying your technology requires no LNP or doesn't require a... [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1218.16s)]
*  No, no, no. Our technology, Recreate LNP or our technology, I would say, can be used by any [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1223.44s)]
*  delivery particle. Okay. Lipid, polymer, whatever you want to use or to use as a delivery vehicle. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1230.64s)]
*  Mm-hmm. Yeah. Are you tackling or facing... I mean, you mentioned that a lot of that is [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1239.68s)]
*  available in the outsourcing community. I mean, just the other day, I interviewed a company that's [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1249.04s)]
*  solely dedicated to the development of delivery vehicles for nucleic acid therapeutics. At present, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1254.64s)]
*  they've built a company on that and they don't even have a therapeutic molecule just yet. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1263.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's... The companies that develop new lipid nanoparticle to improve the bio-distribution [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1269.44s)]
*  we are not seeing those companies as competitors of combined therapeutics. They are complementary [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1280.48s)]
*  approach. And both of them said, if you want to reach almost 99% of bio-distribution success, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1285.68s)]
*  you may want to combine new lipid and a great, more sophisticated mRNA technology. And that's [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1292.8s)]
*  our vision, by the way, at Combined Therapeutics. We are working with our own mRNA technology, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1303.2s)]
*  but we are also assessing the newly-peed generation because we believe that together, [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1308.24s)]
*  they will bring much more safer and with higher efficacy vaccine. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1314.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. How are you doing on time, Dr. Michaud? Are you okay? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1323.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1328.08s)]
*  Yeah. Okay. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1328.72s)]
*  I think we can have a last or two last questions. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1329.36s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. All right. Good. Give us an update, if you can, on the pipeline effort at Combined. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1333.6s)]
*  Where are you in terms of your lead candidate and any follow-ons? [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Absolutely. So we have a pipeline of infectious disease vaccine and cancer vaccine. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1345.44s)]
*  The good news for the companies, we reached two months ago a very important milestone in [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1355.76s)]
*  terms of R&D and product development. That's the selection of our lead platform. That means we have [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1360.96s)]
*  selected the mRNA platform that will better redistribute any vaccine, infectious disease [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1367.6s)]
*  and cancer, and also molecular adjuvant to improve the potency of the vaccine. So in terms of pipeline, [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1377.04s)]
*  we are very pleased to start the manufacturing of our first lead candidates early next year, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1386.1599999999999s)]
*  between the end of this year and early next year. And we have a pipeline including infectious disease [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  vaccine and cancer vaccine with or without molecular adjuvant to improve their efficacy. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1403.1999999999998s)]
*  Very good. As you head into manufacturing there, you mentioned from the outset that mRNA presents [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1413.84s)]
*  some unique manufacturing challenges that your technology seeks to overcome. What challenges [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1419.92s)]
*  remain for you? What do you see as potential risk factors in the manufacturing process that [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1426.0s)]
*  still need to be overcome? Yeah, that's a very good question. I think the landscape is changing [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1432.72s)]
*  rapidly. Probably you would ask me the question two or three years ago, what will be the challenge [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1439.92s)]
*  of the manufacturing? And I may have answered the access to a great CDMO. And currently, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1447.36s)]
*  the CDMO, I think, I mean, it's what you can read in different journal. The CDMO are facing [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1454.4799999999998s)]
*  a decrease in terms of the demand because the vaccine, the current mRNA vaccine, are less used [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1463.6799999999998s)]
*  post-pandemic than during the pandemic. So now I would say the challenge is ready to then select [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1473.36s)]
*  with your own risk factors, depending to your company, the best CDMO to manufacture the drug [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1485.12s)]
*  product. So it's a completely different paradigm in terms of CDMO selection where a few years ago [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1492.56s)]
*  it was, you know, who's got capacity? We'll take, you know, all comers. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1500.56s)]
*  Absolutely. Two years ago, the supply chain was the main risk factor. I want to access the lipid. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1504.8799999999999s)]
*  I want to manufacture the mRNA. The supply chain of the drug substance, the supply chain [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1509.84s)]
*  of the excipients were probably the main risk factor. Today, it's really, I think, to access [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1516.48s)]
*  to the best CDMO that integrates everything, but it's not the access to the raw material. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1526.4s)]
*  That's really the risk factor is purely linked, I would say, to the capacity of the CDMO and the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1533.92s)]
*  company, Combined Therapeutics, to work together and they risk the execution of the program. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1542.4s)]
*  Yeah. Any specific attributes of a CDMO that Combined looked or looks for [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1550.08s)]
*  to make sure you're checking those boxes? Yeah. So currently, we are discussing with a few CDMO [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1558.48s)]
*  because we have started the process of done selection. And I think one of the main challenge [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1569.52s)]
*  is to integrate a CDMO that may be able to achieve [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1579.04s)]
*  everything from the manufacturing of the mRNA to putting your vaccine in a vial [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1590.4s)]
*  and controlling everything, I would say, from A to Z with, of course, the capacity to de-risk [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1601.04s)]
*  if something happened during that process. Yeah. Very good. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1609.04s)]
*  Instead of working with two, three, four different CDMOs. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1613.92s)]
*  Yeah. There is pros and cons for the two organizations. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1618.48s)]
*  What was that? There is pros and cons for the two approaches. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1624.72s)]
*  Sure. Yeah. Well, I know you're short on time, Dr. Mikol. I'm thankful for the time that you gave us. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0YRqaECl6U&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
