# BoB@JPM: Peter Anastasiou, Capsida Biotherapeutics
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU)
*  Peter Anastasiou got his start in Big Pharma with the likes of Lilly and VMS. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=0.0s)]
*  Before too long, he followed the siren song of biotech and never looked back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=10.24s)]
*  I'm Matt Filler. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=15.8s)]
*  This is the Business of Biotech JPM 2025 edition. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=16.8s)]
*  And I'm here with Peter, who is now CEO at Capsida Biotherapeutics. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=20.34s)]
*  Peter had a few stops along the way and those stops are on the agenda for our talk about [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=25.48s)]
*  the lead up to his tenure at Capsida and how he's navigating the ebbs and flows of the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  gene therapy space. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=35.44s)]
*  Peter, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=36.88s)]
*  Nice seeing you too. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=38.08s)]
*  Thanks, Matt. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=39.08s)]
*  I appreciate you taking the time out of a very busy, busy week to spend with the Business [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=40.08s)]
*  of Biotech. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=43.64s)]
*  Yeah, looking forward to it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=44.64s)]
*  It's going to be fun. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=45.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=46.64s)]
*  So I want to start with you and get a little bit of background on where you came from and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=47.64s)]
*  what you've done prior to Capsida. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=50.18s)]
*  You got your start, like I said, in Big Pharma and in sales and marketing. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=51.92s)]
*  So tell us a little bit about that and tell us about when you sort of moved from sales [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=55.52s)]
*  and marketing and transitioned into a new man of... [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=60.96s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  So as you said, I had a fairly traditional start to my career at Big Pharma, Lilly and [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=65.48s)]
*  VMS. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=69.16s)]
*  I was a Lilly 12 years, VMS three years and started always on the commercial side of things. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=70.16s)]
*  Even when I was in commercial in most of that time at Lilly and all the time at VMS, I was [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=76.39999999999999s)]
*  really embedded in working cross-functionally with RD. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=84.03999999999999s)]
*  At Lilly, I was embedded into a drug development team that was focused on coming up with a [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=88.64s)]
*  successor for Prozac. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=92.6s)]
*  Prozac was the biggest drug for Lilly at the time. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=94.28s)]
*  So we had this, it was like a men's project to get a successor to the important franchise [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=96.67999999999999s)]
*  that was already created. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=102.84s)]
*  So I had a deep exposure to drug development, even though I represented the commercial function [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=104.04s)]
*  by being embedded in that team. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=109.44000000000001s)]
*  And I saw the value of what we were doing in terms of commercializing product was only [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  possible if we had products to commercialize. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  So the discovery team, all the preclinical work that was going on, the clinical work, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  certainly regulatory, is what enabled us to ultimately commercialize those products. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  So I had a desire as my career progressed to want to be involved more broadly in drug [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  development and later commercialization and not just commercialization. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=138.92s)]
*  I imagine that having that experience in commercialization, the allure of building is great. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  But when you do that, you sort of give up the rush and excitement and adrenaline of [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  success, right, of commercialization. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=159.44s)]
*  Was there any kind of push-pull going on there? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=161.72s)]
*  No, because there's a different level of adrenaline. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=163.72s)]
*  So as I moved later on in my career to even being more involved in drug development and [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=166.76000000000002s)]
*  eventually overseeing all the operations for later when I was at Lundbeck in North America, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  there was a different level of enthusiasm and adrenaline. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=179.52s)]
*  Every time a study would be in blinded and looking at the study results or even making [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  a shift from phase two to phase three and how do you design a phase three program that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=188.64s)]
*  captures all of the important elements of phase two and not makes a lot of changes? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=194.67999999999998s)]
*  Because obviously, the more changes you make, the more risk you take that the phase three [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  will repeat. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=202.32s)]
*  But at the same time, you learn things from phase two. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=203.32s)]
*  So it's that knife's edge of how do you make the necessary change without making too many? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  So there were always these sources of adrenaline, excitement, enthusiasm, regulatory, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  the negotiating labels with the FDA and what can you get into the label, which then enables you [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=218.2s)]
*  to tell your story commercially. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=225.32s)]
*  All of those things were different levels of a rush. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=228.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=231.88s)]
*  But at the end of the day, all the stuff that we do is to get a medicine to patients. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=232.6s)]
*  And so there's a lot of those points that create a lot of enthusiasm, sometimes some tears. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=239.24s)]
*  There's a lot of failures along the way, but it hooked me, all of that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  So was Lundbeck the first stop post-Big Pharma? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=253.24s)]
*  No. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=257.24s)]
*  So after BMS, I actually joined a medtech startup. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=257.72s)]
*  That was my first entrepreneurial experience. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=262.12s)]
*  So it's not quite biotech, but very similar venture-backed, cash strapped, having to do [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=264.44s)]
*  things on a shoestring budget. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=269.8s)]
*  But we developed the product, first of its kind, in the CNS space, got it FDA approved, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=273.8s)]
*  and then launched it, so being part of that whole journey. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=281.16s)]
*  And then at Lundbeck, so Lundbeck is a 100-year-old company, but in the US, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=284.68s)]
*  Lundbeck didn't have any presence. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=290.2s)]
*  They had always sold their products through other companies, primarily forest pharmaceuticals. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=291.64s)]
*  So I got joined as part of their concerted effort to build out into the US. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=296.2s)]
*  So at first, I came on board to be the head of a business unit, to create a business unit, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=301.32s)]
*  actually from scratch, which we did. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=305.56s)]
*  Then I became the chief commercial officer across all the commercial functions and all [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=308.12s)]
*  the products, and then became the president of US and then later North American operations. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=317.16s)]
*  And we're going to get into some of the more scrappy entrepreneurial experiences. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=318.92s)]
*  But did Lundbeck set you up for what was to come, or do you feel like... [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=324.6s)]
*  I was just kind of curious about how well resourced, being an old company, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  established company overseas, how well resourced you were here in the state. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=333.56s)]
*  It was very similar to like a biotech. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=337.96s)]
*  I mean, we were setting up things from scratch, setting up processes, setting up systems, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=341.64s)]
*  SLPs, and building things from scratch. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=346.84s)]
*  And the way I think about it is we had one venture investor, and that venture investor [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=349.88s)]
*  was the headquarters in Copenhagen that funded our build out of the US. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=354.84s)]
*  We had to deliver for the investors, we had to report back to the investors. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=360.11999999999995s)]
*  So it was a very similar experience of going from very little, kind of a little bit of an embryo, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=364.59999999999997s)]
*  and then growing and building, and the growing pains that come from that. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  And all of that has been applicable to the kind of stuff that we're doing at Capsula. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=374.76s)]
*  And so I love that experience, and I wanted to get back to that experience like that, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=380.04s)]
*  which is ultimately what drove me to Capsula. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=386.68s)]
*  Yeah. So Lundbeck didn't necessarily feel like it came with a safety net? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=389.24s)]
*  No, well, not necessarily. I mean, we had investors that expected us to perform, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=394.12s)]
*  and those investors were the headquarters. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=399.56s)]
*  And so anytime we had a company we wanted to buy, a partnership we wanted to do, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=401.64000000000004s)]
*  if we wanted to do a DTC campaign, which is a huge investment, all that had to be aligned with [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=408.76s)]
*  the main investor back in Copenhagen. So a lot of parallels and similarities that I really learned [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=415.48s)]
*  from, and that I apply every day in what I'm doing at Capsula. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=421.72s)]
*  Yeah. Did you go from Lundbeck directly to Capsula? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=425.40000000000003s)]
*  I did. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=429.32s)]
*  Okay. And you've been there for three years? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=429.88s)]
*  Three years, yeah. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=431.72s)]
*  So what have you observed in that time that you've been at the helm at Capsula in terms [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=433.24s)]
*  of sort of the macroeconomic environment that you've dealt with? I mean, you can draw your [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=438.76s)]
*  own assumptions. You think about the past three years in biotech, but tell us about firsthand [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=444.35999999999996s)]
*  perspectives. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=450.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's really interesting. My timing, not for Capsula. Capsula did great, but for the [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=450.91999999999996s)]
*  macro environment, my timing couldn't have been worse. I was joining Capsula January 2022, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=456.84s)]
*  right off of 2021, which was the best year in biotech ever, arguably. The fundraising [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=463.23999999999995s)]
*  environment was great. The investments people were making, the progress that people were [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  appreciating, investors were appreciating because of the COVID pandemic, our industry and what we [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=476.67999999999995s)]
*  do, and we're willing to put money behind it. And then that kind of came to a screeching halt in [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=481.96s)]
*  2022, right around the time I was joining Capsula. So that was a challenge to deal with. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=486.52s)]
*  And we navigated through it very successfully. And a big part of the way we navigated through [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=493.79999999999995s)]
*  it was we have great investors in Westlake and Burson, great support and great guidance [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=498.2s)]
*  that they give us. But also we embarked on a partnering effort. And so throughout 2022, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=502.84s)]
*  we talked to a lot of companies, but all ended up towards the end of 2022 and beginning of 2023, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=510.84s)]
*  consummating new partnership relationships with Lilly and then expanded partnership with [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=515.56s)]
*  Advie. And so those were great validation of the work we do, but also were an important [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=521.72s)]
*  source of capital for us to not only support their programs that we just partnered on, but also [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=526.76s)]
*  the other work we were doing in terms of building capabilities and moving our own programs forward. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=532.6s)]
*  Yeah. Tell us a little bit about what you can share about how you establish those partnerships, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=537.4s)]
*  like what mechanisms went into making those partnerships happen. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=543.0s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I think it all starts with having something that people want. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=547.72s)]
*  And that comes from solving challenges that exist. So we're in the genetic medicine space, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=551.64s)]
*  specifically gene therapy. And gene therapy has had so much promise and some really good successes [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=556.84s)]
*  with like Algenzma and Alvarez and DMD with Sarepta, but also had a lot of challenges too. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=563.1600000000001s)]
*  Some safety issues, underperformance issues in terms of efficacy, but also commercial performance. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=571.1600000000001s)]
*  And so what we do is we exist to solve the challenges that some of those, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=577.48s)]
*  many of those first generation gene therapy space. And so the partnering effort really is by [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=583.64s)]
*  starting by having a solution to a problem that exists. And so specifically what we focus on is [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=590.68s)]
*  delivery. So a lot of these gene therapies are using naturally occurring viruses like AAV9. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=597.56s)]
*  And for certain tissue targets, that's great. Like if you're targeting the liver, you injected [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=605.56s)]
*  in the IV and most of it accumulates in the liver. So that's no problem. But for other targets, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=611.64s)]
*  like the brain, where there's biological barrier, like the blood brain barrier, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=618.28s)]
*  it's really tough to get to the brain. And so what we do is we engineer capsids, [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=622.12s)]
*  we take those viruses, we engineer them to be able to cross the blood brain barrier. And we're not [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=629.0s)]
*  just CNS focused, those are our lead programs. But any tissue that has a biological barrier, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=635.3199999999999s)]
*  which most do. So getting tropism to where you want to go and at the same time engineering them [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=640.36s)]
*  to not accumulate where you don't want it to go. And in this instance, the liver. So, and as a [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=646.6s)]
*  result of that, we're able to deliver IV. So it all starts with the solution that we're offering [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=651.88s)]
*  to the problems of first generation gene therapies that a lot of these pharma companies have had. So [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  that's what enabled us to get a lot of meetings. We kicked off at this meeting, J.P. Morgan, 2022, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=661.72s)]
*  a partnering process. And it was because of that solution that we have, that we were able to get [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=667.72s)]
*  those meetings, we showed them the progress we were making. We have a great CBO who has great [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=671.96s)]
*  relationships and managed a beautiful process. And that's how we ended up having not just one [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=678.44s)]
*  partnership, but two that came out of that effort in 2022. Yeah. All right. So without getting too [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=683.64s)]
*  propeller head on me, can you talk a little bit about the engineering that enables this? Because [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=690.28s)]
*  you know, there have been, it seems like for years, there's been discussion around, you know, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=697.72s)]
*  outside the liver, right? Yeah. So can you share with us just a little bit on the fundamentals, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=702.84s)]
*  I guess, of that? In a very high level way. So first, the technology that we're based on [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=709.24s)]
*  comes from Caltech. There's a woman named Viviana Brodunaru who has a lab in Caltech, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=714.9200000000001s)]
*  two of the people in her lab, Nick Flizzanis and Nick Godin. Together we call them the NICs. So I [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=719.32s)]
*  may refer to them as the NICs during this call. The three of them are the scientific co-founders. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=726.04s)]
*  And what they did was they take that virus and manipulate the amino acid sequence on the surface [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=731.0s)]
*  of the capsid. And that creates literally billions of variants by doing that, you know, manipulation, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=738.12s)]
*  it can use directed evolution to create billions of capsid variants. And then what we have built [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=744.76s)]
*  is a screening process using robotics and that automation that can filter and screen, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=752.2s)]
*  you know, all the different NHP tissues. The important part is we're doing all our work in [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=759.24s)]
*  NHPs and in human cells, not just in mice. And so we go from the billions of capsids down to [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=764.84s)]
*  thousands of capsids, down to dozens of capsids, down to the one that has the criteria we're looking [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=771.4000000000001s)]
*  for for each disease. So for any disease, you set out in advance almost like a target product [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=776.92s)]
*  profile, like you would for, let's say, a clinical stage product. Here we create what's called the [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=781.88s)]
*  target capsid profile and say, okay, if we want to get to Parkinson's, here's the cells we need to [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=787.9599999999999s)]
*  impact, here's the brain regions we need to get to. And so we set out that criteria in advance and [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=796.4399999999999s)]
*  that filtering process, screening process allows us to get down and identify that capsid. So that's [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=802.76s)]
*  hopefully that wasn't too- No. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=808.76s)]
*  ... overhead. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=810.52s)]
*  Yeah, no offense to the propeller end. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=812.76s)]
*  Yeah, propeller end. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=814.76s)]
*  Oh, that's great. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=815.48s)]
*  Yeah, but hopefully that explains the secret sauce. And so that is our platform, but that platform [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=816.28s)]
*  has been productive. And now that platform has created assets that are on the cusp of going to [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=823.64s)]
*  the clinic and helping to treat patients that have our target diseases. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=829.8s)]
*  Yeah. Then that process, is it a very time-consuming process? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=833.8s)]
*  It started, it's almost like, I'm not in the software world, but they say that once you have [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=839.88s)]
*  your first software, every successive version goes quicker, the turnaround time is quicker. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=845.24s)]
*  It's the same sort of thing. So the first time we did it, took a little longer. And every single [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=850.3599999999999s)]
*  time that process has shrunk down, now to the point where it's in the weeks and not months. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=856.28s)]
*  Yeah. That's an ML, AI enabled process, I'm assuming? [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=863.64s)]
*  No. I mean, no, it's mostly robotics and automation. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=867.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=873.16s)]
*  ... enabled. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=873.64s)]
*  Yeah. For us, certainly AI and all of that has great promise in our industry. But for what we're [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=874.4399999999999s)]
*  doing, doing biological screening, we think is the best way to get the end result that we're [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=880.84s)]
*  looking for versus modeling it or AI and so it approaches. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=886.36s)]
*  Yeah. So we talked a little bit about the macroeconomic environment in 22. And I mean, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=891.1600000000001s)]
*  if you're able to pull through that, you've got a leg to stand on, there's a foundation. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=897.96s)]
*  And then in this field of genetic medicine, there is a microeconomic environment. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=902.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=908.0400000000001s)]
*  On any given day, don't ask me what investors are thinking about or you're looking for, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=908.6s)]
*  but you've got to differentiate, right? You've got to create something that keeps genetic medicine [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=914.36s)]
*  in the therapeutic du jour. Tell me about that. What's that been for you? And what levers [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=919.88s)]
*  and buttons do you have control over to navigate that? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=930.28s)]
*  Yeah. I think everybody understands the potential of gene therapies and genetic [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=934.4399999999999s)]
*  medicines more broadly. And we've seen some of those successes, but we've also seen a lot [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=940.3599999999999s)]
*  of failures. And so I do think genetic medicines in some ways have fallen out of favor in the [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=945.0s)]
*  marketplace. And people are certainly excited about things like obesity and immunology. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=953.3199999999999s)]
*  But we exist to solve the challenges that led to this falling out of favor. So I think what's [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=958.6s)]
*  fallen out of favor is some of those Generation 1 therapies that are using AAV9 and can't be [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=967.48s)]
*  delivered IV without accumulating the liver. Or you have to do direct brain injection. And so [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=974.52s)]
*  all the things that have made genetic medicines, at least in our space and gene therapy fall out [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=980.2800000000001s)]
*  out of favor is why we exist to solve those challenges. So sometimes it's a little frustrated [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=985.16s)]
*  that we get swept up in that broad view. But the important part is that the progress that we're [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=989.8s)]
*  making and its tangible progress, I think will certainly help continue to differentiate us out [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=996.28s)]
*  of the pack of the group that has kind of been a little bit laggards. But I also hope we're going [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1002.6s)]
*  to be at the forefront or the tip of the spear of helping bring a new set of enthusiasm and [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1008.8399999999999s)]
*  a new era of enthusiasm to what we're doing. Yeah. I get the sense that some of the enthusiasm around [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1015.64s)]
*  cell and gene therapies, most cell and gene therapies, some of that enthusiasm gets quelled [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1024.52s)]
*  by the complexity of manufacturing, supply chain, last mile supply chain, if you will, [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1031.32s)]
*  delivery patients, big challenges there. How does Capsida approach or address some of those [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1038.36s)]
*  kind of backend challenges? That's a super important point. So in addition to what I was [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1046.52s)]
*  describing about our differentiation around Capsida engineering and getting to where you [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1051.8s)]
*  want to go and not going to where you don't want to go, one of the other challenges that has set [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1057.3999999999999s)]
*  back a lot of gene therapies is quality of manufacturing. So thanks to our investors, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1061.96s)]
*  again, Westlake and Burson, who understood that and were willing to make an investment in our own [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1068.1200000000001s)]
*  manufacturing facility. So we have a 15,000 square foot manufacturing facility that's in [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1075.16s)]
*  same building where our research labs are in Thousand Oaks. And so we have complete control [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1080.8400000000001s)]
*  over timelines, cost, quality through that manufacturing facility. And on top of that, [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1088.84s)]
*  we build in manufacturing screen room, that screening process that I talked about going [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1094.6s)]
*  from the billions down to the one. Not only are we looking in that screening process for capsids that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1098.36s)]
*  meet the profile that we're looking for, but we're also looking for capsids that are manufacturable, [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1103.56s)]
*  at least in as much quantity and scale and ease as AAV9. So that's one of the early screens that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1109.1599999999999s)]
*  we do to help us select the capsid. And that wouldn't be possible if we were using a CDMO [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1117.0s)]
*  or if we didn't have that capability. And I'm sure there's great CDMOs out there, no criticism, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1122.6s)]
*  but you lose control. And anytime you do a tech transfer, you introduce risks and you can't have [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1127.64s)]
*  the screening as early in the process as you would like. And you don't have that collaboration [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1135.08s)]
*  of being in the same building between the research team and the manufacturing. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1140.28s)]
*  For all those reasons, we made the decision to invest in that facility and it's been a [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1143.96s)]
*  wonderful decision. And not only has it enabled our programs, but quite frankly, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1149.08s)]
*  we're enabling our partners' programs. So I mentioned the partnerships that we, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1154.28s)]
*  and Appy and Lily, we also have a partnership with CRISPR and Stally, but we just got an option as an [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1157.8s)]
*  example opt-in for one of the lead programs from the AAV9 collaboration in neurodegeneration. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1165.0s)]
*  We are going to be the manufacturer for that program. So that's great validation, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1170.84s)]
*  but not only did building that facility enable our programs, but it's enabling the Appy program to [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1176.1999999999998s)]
*  go forward. We have a relationship with a sister portfolio company in the West Lake and Burson [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1181.6399999999999s)]
*  portfolio called Gate Therapeutics. And they don't have a manufacturing facility, and we do. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1189.6399999999999s)]
*  So we've created a relationship in 2023 where we would be a manufacturer for them. Novartis bought [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1195.64s)]
*  them and now they're a Novartis company and they're going to continue to use us as the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1201.88s)]
*  manufacturer. So that capability has been gold for Capsida, but it's proving to be that for the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1207.4s)]
*  Appy program and hopefully other programs from Appy and for these now Novartis programs. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1215.8000000000002s)]
*  Did that manufacturing facility come online under your watch or did that come online? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1223.0s)]
*  It was built, it came online just as I was joining. So I joined in January of 2022 and that's when it [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1228.1999999999998s)]
*  was coming online. But the decision to make that investment was made just prior to when I, well, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1236.52s)]
*  about a year prior to when I came and the great manufacturing team that we had built that out. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1242.6799999999998s)]
*  Our friends at Alston and Bird set us up with some amazing space to record during JPM week. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1249.0s)]
*  The firm's National Healthcare and Life Sciences practice has more than a hundred attorneys [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  actively involved in the healthcare industry across the full spectrum of legal disciplines. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1261.16s)]
*  The signature strength of this practice is its ability to master complex representations [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1267.48s)]
*  that draw on the coordinated expertise of its regulatory, compliance, public policy, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1273.0s)]
*  transactional, corporate governance, securities, FDA, biotech, IP, government investigations, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1278.92s)]
*  and litigation practice areas. Alston and Bird represents life sciences companies and their [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1287.64s)]
*  partners in corporate stages ranging from private to newly public to well established [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1293.3200000000002s)]
*  and in a variety of stages of product development from preclinical to post-approval commercial [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1299.4s)]
*  launch. Learn more at Alston.com and tell them you learned about them on the business of biotech. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1304.8400000000001s)]
*  Do you have any insight into what kind of a heavy lift that took to [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1313.24s)]
*  convince investors that manufacturing analysis is the way to go? [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1317.4s)]
*  It was not cheap. I certainly won't quote what it is that it costs, but I've certainly heard [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1321.5600000000002s)]
*  the discussions with our investors and with our team. It was expensive, but it was worth it for [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1328.5200000000002s)]
*  all the reasons that I mentioned. It would be way more expensive if we had all the reasons that you [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1335.0800000000002s)]
*  even brought up the question is if we have these great programs and they weren't manufacturable on [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1340.3600000000001s)]
*  the right scale or quantity and we had to then go to another CDMO and do a tech transfer and then [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1345.3200000000002s)]
*  delay in our programs or hopefully not having any quality issues or the FDA shutting you down [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1351.8000000000002s)]
*  because of your quality issues would have been way more expensive than making that initial [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1361.4s)]
*  investment. Like I said, we have great investors that had enough wisdom and willingness to make [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1368.2800000000002s)]
*  that investment. I'm thankful that they did. Yeah. The previous episode to this one was with [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1374.0400000000002s)]
*  Stefan Scherr from 3T. We have a common investor at Wesley. Right. Yeah. He spent some time there, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1381.0s)]
*  I believe, in fact. That discussion sort of centered around the shape shifting that an [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1388.12s)]
*  R&D focused company moving into the clinic has to endure or the decision making that a CEO needs to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1394.44s)]
*  make about personnel and where resources are allocated. Obviously, they are not manufacturing [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1400.2s)]
*  in-house, but I would imagine that would be a pretty big sort of shape shift, not only to do [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1406.76s)]
*  in the first place, but to maintain. So, 30 years in now as CEO, tell me about how you're [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1411.56s)]
*  maintaining expertise, qualification, momentum in that manufacturing facility. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1418.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, first of all, we have a great, great team that's super experienced. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1425.4s)]
*  They've been making biologics for literally a lot of 30 years, super experienced team. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1429.88s)]
*  And they're committed to our cause and our mission. They're a really great team that has, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1438.92s)]
*  a lot of them have worked together for a long time and kind of came over as a team. And they've been [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1445.0s)]
*  great for the rest of the organization as well in terms of culture. And so they are pretty [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1449.72s)]
*  self-motivated. But yes, of course, there's a few pivots that you make. You kind of pivot from [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1457.32s)]
*  being a platform to having assets, from having assets to getting them into the clinic, which [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1465.3999999999999s)]
*  that's the state we're at, and going from, let's say, on the manufacturing side, [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1470.9199999999998s)]
*  kind of vector production, small scale for animal experience to then expanding to suspension, [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1475.8s)]
*  broad-based manufacturing for humans at its different quality level of specifications. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1485.0s)]
*  And so all those have been super exciting pivots that we've made successfully up until this point. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1492.3600000000001s)]
*  And the next and most important pivot we're making is filing INDs, which we'll do here in [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1499.24s)]
*  the first half of the year, two INDs, one for our program in developmental and epileptic [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1505.0s)]
*  encephalopathy caused by specific mutation by the STX-DP1 mutation, and then a Parkinson's [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1511.72s)]
*  program caused by GBA mutations. Both of those, knock on wood, will be submitted and approved [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1519.08s)]
*  INDs in the first half of the year. And hopefully we'll be treating our first patients in K-3 [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1525.48s)]
*  for both programs. So all of those have been exciting evolutions. Next steps, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1530.92s)]
*  that at the end of the day, one of the things that we've talked about is the great science [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1537.16s)]
*  that we have isn't just for science sake or not an academic institution. We created the science [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1543.24s)]
*  so that it helps in the service of patients. And so that's also been kind of a north star for all [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1550.3600000000001s)]
*  of us, whether it be the research team, manufacturing team, certainly the clinical team, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1556.28s)]
*  why all of us are here. And so it's a really exciting time for us making that big, big pivot. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1561.48s)]
*  Will that manufacturing facility support clinical trial? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1567.96s)]
*  Yeah, GMP. Actually, we just finished the GMP manufacturing for our first program, [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1572.76s)]
*  the STX-DP1 program, and we're in the middle of finalizing our GMP for the Parkinson's program. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1579.8s)]
*  And so that is at the FDA's quality specs. We've had pre-ID meetings where we've submitted [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1589.08s)]
*  the data that we have, we got positive or supportive feedback from the FDA. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1596.4399999999998s)]
*  So this is a clinical and commercial-grade manufacturing facility. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1602.84s)]
*  Yeah, I asked that question in part because so often when we think about genetic medicine, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1609.32s)]
*  we think rare disease, ultra rare disease. Some of the indications that you guys are looking at [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1615.16s)]
*  are not so rare, certainly not ultra rare. So it seems to me there's a different sort of capacity [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1620.52s)]
*  requirement potentially as you move the products. We certainly have the capacity to do the upcoming [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1627.72s)]
*  clinical trials. But as those programs progress and as our partners' programs progress, I hope [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1635.0s)]
*  we'll be in a situation that we need to expand our facility. We have the capability to expand [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1640.8400000000001s)]
*  our facility in our current footprint. That would be a wonderful situation to be in. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1645.16s)]
*  Yeah, so you were talking about indications. We purposely picked indications that would, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1649.96s)]
*  well, first of all, that have an unmet need that we think we can help these patients. That's first [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1656.68s)]
*  and foremost. But we selected them to be kind of book-ed. So to your point, in gene therapy, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1660.52s)]
*  a lot of the traditional programs are in pediatrics, ultra rare or small diseases. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1666.92s)]
*  So the STXPP1 program is certainly not ultra rare, but it is considered rare. It's about 5,000 [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1673.32s)]
*  patients in the US and Europe and in pediatric population. That's kind of the traditional place, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1679.48s)]
*  gene therapy is at play. And on the other end, we selected Parkinson's GBA, adult population, [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1685.96s)]
*  neurodegeneration, bigger patient population, about 300,000 patients in the US and Europe. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1693.6399999999999s)]
*  We wanted to show the bookends of what's possible with our capsids, with our cargo optimization [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1701.8s)]
*  capabilities, everything. And so that's why we picked those two as elite programs. And it also, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1709.0s)]
*  to your point, showcases what's possible on the manufacturing side too, to be able to accommodate [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1713.96s)]
*  both of those population of adult patients that require more and broader populations, as well as [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1720.76s)]
*  the rare condition in the spin of younger patient population. So I think those indications, [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1728.44s)]
*  those programs, besides being best in class to help patients who are desperately suffering, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1735.16s)]
*  also are a great showcase of what's possible through our technology. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1740.28s)]
*  Yeah. We talked a bit about the investment community and its appetite for genetic therapies. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1744.44s)]
*  Like I said, given that so much of the nucleus of activity in this space has been in ultra rare, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1751.56s)]
*  what's different? Sort of compare and contrast for me, what's different in terms of your approach [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1757.08s)]
*  to the partner investment community in broader indications than what these small, like ultra rare [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1762.04s)]
*  indication developers are experiencing? Is there a difference? I mean... [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1772.1999999999998s)]
*  Well, so we've had a receptive audience from the investment community, just like we have from the [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1777.0s)]
*  pharma community, because again, we're doing things, we're solving problems that exist. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1784.6s)]
*  And certainly just like pharma companies, some are into rare diseases, some are not, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1790.04s)]
*  some are into broader diseases. There's investors that have a thesis in each camp. And so everybody, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1794.52s)]
*  they have to be focused on where they invest, so they can invest in everything. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1803.8s)]
*  Sure. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1807.1599999999999s)]
*  But it's been a receptive conversation. I think even the rare disorders, I mean, look at [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1807.7199999999998s)]
*  company like Surepta and the success they've had. I just saw that they announced that they're [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1814.6s)]
*  performing ahead of their plan in the commercial uptake of their product. All that creates great [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1819.48s)]
*  momentum for the types of things we do. And while there have been challenges in CNS, even on the... [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1825.24s)]
*  I'm sorry, not in CNS, in gene therapy, on the commercialization side, in the CNS part of gene [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1831.24s)]
*  therapy, there's been some good successes with Avexis, Nautilus Vardis, and Zolgensma, and [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1838.76s)]
*  Surepta, what they're doing with Elvetis. And we think we're going to have similar success, [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1845.48s)]
*  even in the rare population and certainly in the broader population with the Neurodegeneration [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1850.92s)]
*  program. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1858.36s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. You've talked a bit about what Kepcita is doing to change the paradigm in gene therapy, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1858.84s)]
*  and you bear a responsibility to do that apparently. What do you see across the greater [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1866.76s)]
*  landscape? What does the rest of the... I don't mean to make it an us versus them kind of thing, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1871.72s)]
*  but from your perspective, what does the rest of the field need to do to bring gene therapy back [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1877.32s)]
*  to the development stage that it needs to be at, right? [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1883.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think the field needs to be more selective about what indications we're pursuing, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1888.04s)]
*  what the technology you use. Like I said, certain diseases, it's perfectly fine to use [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1894.36s)]
*  AAV-based therapies because you can easily get to certain tissues, but for those more difficult [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1899.24s)]
*  tissues to get to, like the brain. And like many other organs, I mean, the kidney has biological [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1906.52s)]
*  barriers, the lung has biological barriers, the eye has biological barriers. So just being smart [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1911.6399999999999s)]
*  about the indications, being smart about the delivery technology that's being used. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1919.96s)]
*  And then of course, cargo and things like that. But I really think that, again, I'm quite hopeful [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1926.52s)]
*  that with some of the successes that are happening, particularly in some of the CNS [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1933.08s)]
*  gene therapies that I mentioned, but also progress we're making, and quite frankly, others [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1937.16s)]
*  are making as well, I think will help, I hope, but I think will help to restore some of the [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1941.32s)]
*  momentum and enthusiasm. Because at the end of the day, it's undeniable the benefit that gene [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1947.88s)]
*  therapies can have for patients if they're done right. I mean, if you have a clear genetic cause [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1952.8400000000001s)]
*  of a disease and you can fix that genetic cause, whether it be through a gene therapy or a gene [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1958.3600000000001s)]
*  editing approach, those are disease modifying and possibly curative. So the power is undeniable. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1964.92s)]
*  These aren't symptomatic treatments like in our Parkinson's program. I mean, levodopa is [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1974.04s)]
*  so critical, but eventually it wears out. I mean, it's a symptomatic treatment. What we're trying [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1981.72s)]
*  to do is alter the course of the Parkinson's caused by the GBA mutations. That's just so powerful. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1986.76s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of companies that understand that. That's why there's many that [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1996.28s)]
*  are still quite engaged in gene therapy. And there's a lot of investors that see that. So [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=1999.8s)]
*  then it's incumbent upon us and others to deliver on that promise. And that's why we exist. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2005.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. What is the greater gene therapy landscape in CNS disorders look like? Is it a [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2010.84s)]
*  competitive space? Do you find a lot of people working there or people moving toward CNS? [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2019.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. I think there are people working in it certainly. I think again, the unmet need, [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2026.36s)]
*  the problems that exist are undeniable. So it's certainly attracted some interest. I'm quite proud [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2032.92s)]
*  of where we're at and the programs that we have are all, the potentially would be best in class. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2038.84s)]
*  Again, we're about to be in the clinic. And so I'm a believer, I think competition brings the best [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2044.92s)]
*  out of people. Fear of competition. The old saying is the best thing that ever happened to [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2052.36s)]
*  Coke was Pepsi. And so there is something about having all boats rise when a couple of members [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2058.36s)]
*  are in a category and are working together, working men and men not together, but are working [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2066.44s)]
*  towards solving problems. It just brings a little bit of vigilance and a little extra something from [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2071.6400000000003s)]
*  all of us. But I wish anybody who's in this space, I want the whole field to succeed. Because again, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2077.0s)]
*  it'll bring momentum back to the field. It'll bring more investors in. It'll bring even more [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2082.84s)]
*  pharma companies in. And ultimately, it'll just help more patients. So that's how I think about [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2088.44s)]
*  competition field. Yeah. Give us a snapshot of where CAPSED is today in terms of that march [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2094.6s)]
*  toward the clinic. Yeah. So we're very much in execution mode to get ready for our IND filings. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2101.56s)]
*  We've done all the IND enabling work that needs to be done for those two programs. We've had pre-IND [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2109.88s)]
*  meetings with the FDA. We've done dose range finding studies. We've dosed our GLP thought studies. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  And we've done manufacturing scale up for one of the programs or almost done with the other. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2121.8s)]
*  So now we're just waiting for the final results of those studies. And then we'll package those INDs [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2125.7200000000003s)]
*  both in the first half of this year. And in parallel, we're preparing for the clinic. So [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2132.52s)]
*  we have a great chief medical officer who's hired a great team and also a network of [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2137.72s)]
*  CROs and outside consultants that are busy talking to sites and getting those sites up and ready. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2143.3199999999997s)]
*  We don't want to start that process after the IND is approved. We started that process months ago [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2149.64s)]
*  so that we're ready as soon as the IND is approved that we can start planning for and first patients [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2154.68s)]
*  to get treated. So that's what our focus has been. I mean, this has been, the company's been around [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2161.56s)]
*  five years. This has been the, and actually the people at Caltech were working on for many years [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2167.24s)]
*  before. This is the culmination of the work that's gone on for many years is to get to this point to [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2173.16s)]
*  help patients. Yeah. Yeah. It's always interesting to me to have a conversation around sort of that [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2180.68s)]
*  metering of the shape shifting of the growth of the hires, pre-IND, we need to put a clinical [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2186.68s)]
*  team into place. There's all this risk involved in that, right? Planning for the next step and [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2194.2s)]
*  building for the next step. Give us some insight, advice if you will, to aspiring biotech builders [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2200.6s)]
*  on that element of it. Obviating for the next step, being a step ahead and embracing the risk [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2207.96s)]
*  of being ready for the next step. Yeah. I think you have to have the passion for building and you [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2215.0s)]
*  have to have the tolerance for risk and you have to understand that innovation is not a straight [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2221.32s)]
*  line. It's usually like this, but as long as you're heading upward, then you're doing well. But if [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2227.0800000000004s)]
*  you were off cooling ourselves and we think it's going to be a completely straight line, no setbacks, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2234.84s)]
*  that's just not reality. I think it's a mindset that someone needs to have. You're asking about [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2242.04s)]
*  my career earlier, even though it was a little bit different, it was the same kind of experience [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2247.8s)]
*  that I had at Lundbeck. So when we were building and taking on risks of developing products, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2254.2000000000003s)]
*  licensing products, buying companies, all of those take risk, all of those have setbacks. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2259.8s)]
*  You're building new capabilities, you have SOPs, you make some mistakes and you learn from those [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2266.84s)]
*  mistakes. It's all very similar as the capabilities we're building, building a clinical [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2275.4s)]
*  regulatory team, moving from a new phase of manufacturing, moving into the GMP scale. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2281.56s)]
*  All of those are exciting, fun. There's challenges you run into that you have to overcome, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2291.96s)]
*  and I think you have to be ready for that ride. And then the other thing I would say is, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2298.6s)]
*  especially as a CEO, sometimes people expect the CEO to be an expert at everything. I personally [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2303.72s)]
*  think the best CEOs are those that understand what they're expert at and hire people who are [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2309.88s)]
*  expert at the things that they're not and creating a clear strategy, creating a clear set of objectives [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2316.68s)]
*  and goals that they hold people accountable towards delivering, inspecting on what's happening, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2323.72s)]
*  but at the same time and holding people accountable, but at the same time, giving people [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2329.16s)]
*  the latitude to exert the expertise you hire them for. And also as a CEO to be the biggest champion, [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2333.48s)]
*  storyteller of the company, chief fundraiser, all of those things. So for those who are interested [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2344.2799999999997s)]
*  in a career or aspire to become a biotech CEO, I think those are some of the thoughts I would share. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2350.3599999999997s)]
*  No, they're all good thoughts. Now level with us and tell us what's not fun. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2357.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, the inevitable setbacks are not fun. The funding environment hasn't been fun, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2365.4s)]
*  even though we've navigated it well. We're a five-year-old company and still the only [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2372.92s)]
*  equity route we raced was the original Series A. All the rest of the funding has come through [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2378.6800000000003s)]
*  pharma partnering and we've been very successful at that. But not having the kind of momentum [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2383.32s)]
*  in the macroeconomic environment and biotech or the momentum behind genetic medicines and [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2391.32s)]
*  few therapy, those things haven't been fun, but we've navigated through that. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2398.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So what's on the agenda here at JPMorgan25? And it's an interesting question to ask because [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2402.84s)]
*  there's the obvious. Well, I'm here to meet with investors and find partners, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2409.48s)]
*  but there's obviously nuance in the response that I get to that question. So specific to Capsito, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2413.8s)]
*  what are you doing? Yeah. Well, first and foremost, we have a speaking slot at the conference, [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2418.6800000000003s)]
*  which is great. And so this is the biggest meeting of the year and kicks off the year and couldn't be [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2425.2400000000002s)]
*  better timing for us because of the transition we're about to make from preclinical to [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2432.76s)]
*  clinical. And it really is that transition in addition to the presentation that we're [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2438.6s)]
*  communicating here to pharma companies, to investors about the progress that we made and [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2443.88s)]
*  getting these lead programs on the cusp of being in a clinic and treating patients. So it's mostly [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2451.72s)]
*  awareness building around the progress. We've always maintained and worked hard to maintain [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2458.68s)]
*  relationships with pharma companies, investors, et cetera, and make sure that they know what we're [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2464.76s)]
*  up to and the progress that we're making. I'm a big believer that you don't just show up to somebody [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2469.6400000000003s)]
*  when you're looking for something, whether it be a partnership or an investment. I think telling [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2476.5200000000004s)]
*  our story, building awareness, creating a base of knowledge for those communities of what we're up [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2482.2000000000003s)]
*  to just makes it so much more easy when there is something specific or tangible that you're [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2489.4s)]
*  working on, whether it be with pharma companies or with investors. So it's mostly awareness building [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2496.44s)]
*  about as you use a phase shift that the pretty significant one we're about to embark on. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2501.88s)]
*  Yeah, very cool. I want to ask another question about the meeting, the JPM meeting. I was just [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2509.32s)]
*  having a conversation about this with a colleague of mine and I've sat in on a number of them and [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2515.72s)]
*  I see what happens on stage and we talked about, we're just having a speculative conversation about [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2519.7999999999997s)]
*  how important what happens off stage might be. So I'm curious if you can give our listeners [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2526.04s)]
*  some insight into the mechanics of that meeting. So I'm assuming you'll be presenting? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2531.08s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be presenting. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2535.16s)]
*  You'll be presenting. Now, did you bring... So you'll present, you'll do the pitch deck, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2536.12s)]
*  you'll hope that you got all the right points, right? A lot of prep that goes into that. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2541.3999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2546.12s)]
*  Now, did you bring a support team? They got some more scientists like on propeller heads, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2546.52s)]
*  so we're going to take questions off stage. What does that look like? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2552.44s)]
*  Yes. So the short answer is yes. Our chief medical officer, our chief technology officer, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2557.3199999999997s)]
*  and our chief research and innovation officer, as well as other members of the leadership team will [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2561.8799999999997s)]
*  be there, but they'll be part of the Q&A at the end. But it's interesting when you say off stage, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2567.08s)]
*  my time on stage is total of 25 minutes and we're here for five days. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2573.88s)]
*  So most of the action for us, but almost everybody is not even related to the specific conference. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2580.2799999999997s)]
*  It's the magnet, the conference that has attracted all these people that are here. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2587.24s)]
*  So it's really outside of the conference that we're having this conversation, talking to [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2594.12s)]
*  pharma companies, talking to investors, meeting with our current partners. We have the partnerships [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2600.44s)]
*  with Abby, Lily, and CRISPR, so we're taking advantage of the fact that we're here and working [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2605.88s)]
*  with them, meeting with them, update on the programs, the progress, meeting with our old [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2611.0s)]
*  investors. Since we're all in the same place, it's an opportunity to make sure to communicate, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2618.04s)]
*  stay connected with our current investors. So that's how we're spending our time. And again, [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2624.6s)]
*  I think for everybody, most of the action's outside the conference. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2631.24s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. Yes, Stephane earlier talked about how it's like an 8 to 11 day. That's [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2634.2s)]
*  probably conservative. Yeah, certainly it was yesterday. First night with all the receptions [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPnAyhGgfvU&t=2640.44s)]
