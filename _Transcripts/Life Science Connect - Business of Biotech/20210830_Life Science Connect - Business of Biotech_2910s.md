Video Description: Dr. Ian Walters' company, Portage Biotech, is focused on addressing the 75% of cancer patients who show no, or limited, response to existing therapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Leading that charge are the company's invariant natural killer T cell agonists, designed to activate the innate and adaptive immune system, as well as a growing portfolio of proteins, antibodies, and small molecules. On this episode of the Business of Biotech, Dr. Walters shares what's fueling the company's progress, including its unique financing strategy and its approach to de-risking platform development for novel immuno-oncology therapies.

# iNK T-Cell Immuno-oncology For Solid Tumors With Dr. Ian Walters
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [August 30, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE)
*  If you've been listening to the Business of Biotype podcast for a while now, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=0.0s)]
*  you'll recall that Erin Harris has joined me to co-host a few episodes. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=3.44s)]
*  Erin's my friend, colleague, and chief editor over at sellandgene.com, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=7.2s)]
*  and she just recently launched a podcast of her own. It's aptly named Sell and Gene, the podcast. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And if you're working in the Sell and Gene space, you should give it a listen. It's a collection of [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=17.04s)]
*  interviews with the industry and academic leaders moving the space forward. And you can find it at [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=21.2s)]
*  sellandgene.com or anywhere you listen to podcasts. Sell and Gene, the podcast. Check it out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=25.68s)]
*  Multi-time founder, Dr. Ian Walters could serve up a masterclass on the business of biotech. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=40.24s)]
*  The current CEO of Portage Biotech has founded about a half dozen life sciences companies on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=46.32s)]
*  the back of big pharma leadership experience at companies including Takeda and Bristol Meyer Squib. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=51.84s)]
*  He also sits on and or chairs a handful of biotech company boards. The dive into the business and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=58.32000000000001s)]
*  board side of biopharma came shortly after he departed academia, where he earned his MD [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=64.72s)]
*  at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine before doing translational research at Rockefeller [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  University and then moving along to Wharton for his MBA. At Portage, Dr. Walters and his team are [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=75.36s)]
*  building a broad and deep multidisciplinary pipeline. But some of their most important work is on [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=82.0s)]
*  invariant natural killer T cell agonist liposomal formulations. We'll dig into that and more on this [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=87.84s)]
*  episode of the business of biotech. But first, let's learn a bit more about our guest, Dr. Walters. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=95.28s)]
*  I'm honored you could join us and thank you. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=101.11999999999999s)]
*  Great to be here, Matt. Thanks. I'm excited to tell you more about what we're doing at Portage and [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=104.0s)]
*  help your followers understand this business of immuno-oncology. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=109.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm looking forward to the conversation too. But before we dig into the nuts and bolts of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=115.28s)]
*  the conversation about Portage, our mutual friend and colleague, Alan Shaw, has told me a little bit [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=119.44s)]
*  about you. And among other things, he tells me that you are a more than proficient drummer. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=125.76s)]
*  And he also tells me that your son holds the distinction of hitting the longest home run in [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=133.52s)]
*  Little League. I don't know if it's Little League World Series history. Am I getting that right or [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=143.52s)]
*  am I completely, am I wires completely? Yeah, when I'm not developing drugs, I'm in the backyard [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  throwing BP. I got two boys playing baseball and we were lucky our team won the state and went to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=153.52s)]
*  the divisionals in the Little League World Series and my son hit one over the trees. And the interview [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=160.24s)]
*  afterwards, they said he hit it halfway to Miami. Wow. It was quite an experience for a 12-year-old [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=166.08s)]
*  to have in his lifetime, efficiently captured by ESPN in every angle and broadcast online. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=173.52s)]
*  So if you search up Dustin Walters Little League, you'll see the video on the Little League World [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=180.72s)]
*  website. Yeah. Well, I'm definitely going to do that. Thanks for acknowledging that and [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=188.16s)]
*  acknowledging all the hours that I spend throwing balls in the backyard. Throwing balls to the point [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=194.4s)]
*  that the arm is too sore to go in and practice your drums. You're a drummer as well. That's true. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=199.36s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I came from a background where I grew up working on cars. So I didn't really have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=205.68s)]
*  any role models in the science or medicine fields. And I had played a lot of music. I got accepted to [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=210.8s)]
*  Juilliard. And of course, my parents said, no pressure, we'll support you if you want to be a [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=218.08s)]
*  musician. Of course, we'd love it if you became a doctor. And now I can say that I do both and I do [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=222.56s)]
*  both well. So I'm excited that I can keep my passion going at the same time that hopefully I [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=229.28s)]
*  can develop treatments to help a lot of cancer patients. Yeah, that's excellent. Well, thank you [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=234.56s)]
*  for allowing me to share your proud dad moment too on your son's home run. That's pretty incredible. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=238.96s)]
*  So all right, let's turn it away from baseballs and drums and back into science. And again, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=246.08s)]
*  I want to get to know kind of what drives Dr. Walters a little bit more clearly. Your background [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  is, you know, it's comprehensive, right? You've got business chops, clinical, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=259.52s)]
*  clinical experience, biotech expertise, you're trained MD, PhD, MBA. You've overseen the [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=263.84s)]
*  development of the development process for oncology compounds with pharma leaders like BMS. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=271.03999999999996s)]
*  How do you, you know, how do you rationalize the step that you took to found Portage? Why did you [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  choose to focus exclusively there on novel immuno-oncology discovery and development with this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=283.12s)]
*  this startup? Yeah, I, you know, I try not to focus at the letters after my name, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=289.28s)]
*  but I focus on the skills that I've acquired over the years. So I practiced medicine for a while. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=295.76s)]
*  I obviously spent my time in the lab and even added some business acumen to that. And it's really how [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  I combine those three different disciplines to try to accelerate the development of new treatments. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  And I think you recall, and you've said that I've spent seven years at Bristol Myers and [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=313.92s)]
*  being there, you really helped me develop my kind of own interests in a couple of ways. One, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=319.68s)]
*  you can see what the, you know, I don't want to say unlimited, but what you can achieve in a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  situation where you have plenty of resource. We had essentially acquired products from a small [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=334.96000000000004s)]
*  biotech company, so we didn't discover them. But, you know, we put the full resource and knowledge [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=342.72s)]
*  base of a big international pharma company behind them, brought them to market in record speed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=348.72s)]
*  And we essentially changed the whole landscape for the treatment of oncology. So in the past, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  most companies were focused on, you know, attacking the tumor. And when you do that, you know, you [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=363.04s)]
*  would be excited if you could improve survival by, you know, a couple months, you know, because that [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=368.8s)]
*  was, you know, meaningful. What happened when we shifted our focus from the tumor to the immune [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=374.8s)]
*  system, we saw that if we could get the immune system to recognize the cancer, we could get [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=380.32s)]
*  patients to survive for years and in fact be cured. And we tended to be less toxic. So that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=386.16s)]
*  really changed our expectation. And a lot of the, you know, effort in the oncology space has been [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=394.48s)]
*  shifted to how do we get more patients to respond and how do we get them to stay in response for [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=400.8s)]
*  longer periods of time. And that really influenced me. I met these patients who were told they had [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=405.6s)]
*  three months to live and they've been alive 10 years and they're in perfect health with very [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=411.52000000000004s)]
*  little limitations on their lifestyle. So, you know, I really got involved in that and I got [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  involved with that on the strategy side for Bristol Myers, you know, really looking externally [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=422.88s)]
*  at what was out there and trying to figure out how we can bring in new technologies to [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=428.24s)]
*  make advances in this area. And unfortunately, when you're at a big pharma, you know, the decision [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=435.2s)]
*  process is slow. There's a lot of people who get involved in decisions and typically these small [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=440.32s)]
*  companies were not developing the drugs the way a big pharma likes to see them. Right. So they didn't [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=446.48s)]
*  have the right data or they didn't have the right, you know, types of experiments and the right [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=452.8s)]
*  presentation to get a big pharma to want to partner with them. That was sort of a light bulb [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  moment for me. I saw that as an opportunity potentially to leave the auspice of a big pharma [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  to go out there and figure out a way to do that. Now I wasn't the founder of Portage by any means, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=471.12s)]
*  that company had been founded prior to my arrival. I joined the board first of Portage [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=476.72s)]
*  and actually started developing, you know, cancer technologies on the side with the same investors [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=482.56s)]
*  of Portage. And then in 2019, we decided to combine my cancer business with Portage. And now that's [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=490.40000000000003s)]
*  the iteration I then took over running Portage. And now we have a company that's focused on cancer [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=497.76s)]
*  immunotherapy and specifically identifying products that address known resistance [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=504.08s)]
*  to the current standard of care. And these are the standard of care that me and members of my team [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=511.35999999999996s)]
*  helped develop when we were at BMS. So we know the area inside and out. And a lot of the work [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=516.0799999999999s)]
*  that we're doing now really started back when we were working with the big resources of a company [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=522.48s)]
*  like Bristol Myers. Yeah. Yeah. So traditionally, this has been, you know, the development of novel [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=529.12s)]
*  immunotherapies for solid tumors has been pretty tough. It's been a tough field. What's your [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=535.44s)]
*  approach? Give us a little bit, I guess, behind the curtains glimpse of what that approach looks like. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=541.84s)]
*  So, you know, like success is more than just having good science, right? So, you know, there's a lot of [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=548.72s)]
*  people doing work in this area. And part of what we have really tried to do is to identify promising [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=556.08s)]
*  areas and really figure out from a strategic perspective, what's needed to really de-risk and [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=563.76s)]
*  to understand these things first in animals, then in humans, and what experiments are needed to really [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  attract the interest of big pharma. We have to understand that we're in a very unique time frame [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=578.48s)]
*  in this field. We've never seen a situation like what we have today in oncology. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=585.1199999999999s)]
*  And I'll kind of elucidate that. Yeah. So BMS and Merck were really the first to come to the table [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=589.76s)]
*  in this space. They both developed PD-1 antibodies. And you fast forward to today. And now there's 14 [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=595.68s)]
*  approved antibodies that address PD-1 as a target. And for all intents and purposes, these are very [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=602.16s)]
*  similar products. So, you have 14 drugs by all the major players in this space that are not very [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=608.8s)]
*  well differentiated from each other. The only way that these big companies can differentiate [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=617.8399999999999s)]
*  is by developing a novel combination. So, this is an interesting kind of dilemma for the industry, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=623.92s)]
*  right? Because these drugs are starting to become more like a commodity, you know, with lack of [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=631.68s)]
*  differentiation. We've always had to develop drugs that were either safer or more effective. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=636.08s)]
*  And in this case, you have 14 very similar drugs. So, you know, I view that as a business [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=641.2s)]
*  opportunity, right? Companies need to differentiate. They need to define combinations that could [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=646.96s)]
*  help them differentiate their product over one of the competitors. And, you know, I really set out [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=653.9200000000001s)]
*  with our team to try to identify compounds that could do that. And one of the nice things about [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=660.4s)]
*  being some of the pioneers in this space is that we know a lot of the players. So, we know that, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=667.1999999999999s)]
*  you know, all the people, well, a lot of the people at the companies that could partner with [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=672.9599999999999s)]
*  us and or could acquire these technologies. We know the people in the academic space that are doing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=678.0s)]
*  the work on the science. And it allows us to, you know, try to pre-vet or pre-understand what the [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=683.12s)]
*  bar and the hurdle is. So, we have a pretty good sense of what we need to achieve. We have a really [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=690.8s)]
*  good understanding of the science from our work. We have a good understanding of what all the [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=697.52s)]
*  competition's doing. And the idea is that, you know, we want to go out and build a pipeline of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=702.0s)]
*  products that could be best in class or first in class in this space where we know how to develop [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=707.12s)]
*  them and what hurdles we need to achieve. And if we can achieve that, then we want to kill it as [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=715.68s)]
*  quickly as possible because we don't want to get into expensive development when there's a very low [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=721.36s)]
*  probability of success. We have this, you know, mantra, which is, you know, we're not doing [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=727.28s)]
*  glorified science experiments. We're doing experiments we know are going to contribute to [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=734.24s)]
*  helping people make decisions about the future of this, these mechanisms and these products [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=739.6800000000001s)]
*  that are going to help us gain the confidence of potential pharma partners. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=746.0s)]
*  And then, you know, then you put the process in place to execute and to execute upon that. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=750.4s)]
*  And we're in a very unique position, you know, over the past five or six years now, we've built [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=755.76s)]
*  a rather large pipeline for a company of our size with very diverse products and technologies. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=760.72s)]
*  And, you know, we have the opportunity in the next, you know, two years to turn over some of [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=768.08s)]
*  these cards to get some of these data reads and to hopefully, you know, build upon our early success [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=774.08s)]
*  in starting a company called Biohaven. I don't know if you're familiar with that company, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  but that was one of the original successes of Portage where we, you know, started a company. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=785.6s)]
*  We guided them through the process of development. That company was the second largest IPO [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=792.64s)]
*  in the year 2017. It's now a $6 billion plus company with a commercial product. And we were [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=799.12s)]
*  able to kind of distribute that value creation to our shareholders. I think, you know, with the [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=806.08s)]
*  pipeline that we have now, we have multiple chances to do that again in the oncology space. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=811.68s)]
*  Yeah. You mentioned the diversity of that pipeline, the breadth and depth of it. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=816.2399999999999s)]
*  Was that strategic and were there any, so two part question, was that strategic and were there any [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=821.52s)]
*  sort of guardrails or limitations coming in that you wanted to maintain or was it just [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=827.76s)]
*  the breadth and depth of that pipeline sort of a result of not having parameters around what you [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=835.28s)]
*  were setting out to do? Yeah. Well, it was certainly nice to be constrained in doing this, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=840.4s)]
*  right? Like the constraints we had when we were at BMS and our other companies that we've all worked [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=845.76s)]
*  at. So we started with the blank space, I think, you know, but we had clear parameters of where we [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=850.88s)]
*  thought the unmet needs were and what we thought the areas of opportunity. So we mentioned earlier [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=857.28s)]
*  resistance. So we're not looking at everything in the oncology space and we're not looking at [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=864.0s)]
*  everything in the immuno-oncology space. We're looking at what we learned over the years contribute [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=868.32s)]
*  to the mechanisms why certain people don't respond to the existing drugs. And they really fall into [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=874.88s)]
*  two or three mechanistic buckets, right? Either tumors are cold, immunologically cold, meaning [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=882.08s)]
*  they don't have an existing immune response. So you need to make sure that you can generate [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=888.6400000000001s)]
*  an immune response and a tumor that doesn't have one already. So that's a key mechanism. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=896.0s)]
*  And that involves immune priming and antigen presentation and things like that. We also know [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=901.28s)]
*  that tumors exist in an organ. And that organ has what we call a tumor microenvironment. And many [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=907.8399999999999s)]
*  times in that microenvironment are the hostile players that keep the immune cells out and prevent [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=914.4s)]
*  them from killing cancer. So you have to fix the immune microenvironment and the tumor. And lastly [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=921.12s)]
*  is an immune cell is designed to remove and to attack things that are foreign to the body. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=929.52s)]
*  And you really don't want your immune cells attacking your normal tissue. That's how people [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=939.44s)]
*  get autoimmune disease. And in many cases, the tumor types that respond to immunotherapy are the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=944.48s)]
*  ones that are the most foreign, meaning they have developed the most mutations. I'll give you an [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=954.72s)]
*  example. We get skin cancer primarily because we're outside and we're exposed to radiation all the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=961.12s)]
*  time. It causes a lot of mutations in our skin cells. And one of the most responsive tumor types [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=966.24s)]
*  to immunotherapy is skin cancer. So melanoma was the first tumor type that we got these drugs [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=972.8s)]
*  approved. And it's because they're highly mutated. But if you start looking at things like colon [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=977.28s)]
*  cancer or pancreatic cancer, they tend to have a very low level of mutations. And immunotherapy has [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=982.88s)]
*  for the most part not shown any benefit in those tumor types. So those are kind of key mechanisms [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=989.12s)]
*  that we say, all right, well, we want to take a colon or pancreatic tumor and we want to make it [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=995.28s)]
*  recognized by the immune system so that we can leverage the power of this type of treatment [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1000.48s)]
*  in those settings. So we didn't just pull these things out of our backpack. We spent many years, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1006.48s)]
*  as I said, some of that was while we were at BMS with hundreds of people kind of helping to [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1013.0400000000001s)]
*  understand the landscape, to pick products that, as you said, span very diverse technology platforms. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1018.96s)]
*  We're not, when you're at a pharma company and you have an antibody platform, you tend to develop [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1028.3999999999999s)]
*  antibodies. And we said, look, we're starting from scratch. We can develop antibodies, but we can [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1033.04s)]
*  also develop other drugs. So we've started with a very focused effort to try to find these key [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1037.84s)]
*  mechanisms and in particular, how to combine these key mechanisms in a single patient. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1046.1599999999999s)]
*  Because the solution, as you might anticipate, is not going to be one drug is going to cure all of [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1052.08s)]
*  cancer. It's going to be a series of products given in combination, addressing these key mechanisms [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1056.88s)]
*  that really give the most patients the ability to hopefully have a long-term response. And that's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1065.3600000000001s)]
*  really what the goal is, really long-term response, off of treatment, which we think will translate [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1071.0400000000002s)]
*  into effective cures. I really appreciate that explanation. Dr. Walters in it, that's sort of [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  the simplification of the construct of the company for me. And I'm going to take that [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1085.76s)]
*  simplification one step further, because that's what I tend to do, think simply. And I'm just [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1091.2s)]
*  going to throw the, I guess, the observation out there that if I begin a factory with a blank slate [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1096.48s)]
*  and I determine that I want to make four or five, six, eight different parts in that factory, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1102.56s)]
*  I create for myself a manufacturing challenge in that I need to have the equipment and [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1109.04s)]
*  infrastructure and personnel to create four or five, six, eight different parts within that [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1114.24s)]
*  factory. So it's much the same when you have a wide open, broad, diverse pipeline of candidates. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1118.24s)]
*  What manufacturing challenges did you encounter from the get-go and how are you addressing them [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1124.24s)]
*  with such diversity, not being a one-trick? Clearly, manufacturing is very complex. It's [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1133.1200000000001s)]
*  a regulated field. And very early on, we made a strategic decision that it doesn't make sense [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1138.96s)]
*  for us to build that capacity internally. It's just too complicated. That being said, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1147.28s)]
*  there are many, many different groups that you can partner with and create strategic relationships [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1156.08s)]
*  where you can accomplish your goals of making high quality products without building that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1161.8400000000001s)]
*  infrastructure. And that's the decision that we made. And yeah, and just like you said, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1168.32s)]
*  there's different expertise even to oversee these contract manufacturers that are needed for [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1175.76s)]
*  somebody to make an antibody versus a small molecule versus a particle. And one of the [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1182.0s)]
*  things that we didn't really talk about in our model, and it was something very influenced by [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1187.6799999999998s)]
*  one of my previous companies, which you mentioned, which was Millennium, it was acquired by Takeda [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1192.6399999999999s)]
*  after I left. But the guys who started Millennium and who I worked with started Third Rock Ventures. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1197.36s)]
*  And if you're a biotech, you know Third Rock has been extremely successful at building companies. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  And one of the ways that contributes to their success is their broad network of very senior [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1208.32s)]
*  people. And that's something that I admired and I brought to the table in this venture, which is [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1214.56s)]
*  make sure that we have access to the best talent and the best people in every discipline. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1221.04s)]
*  And it's not, you know, and one of the advantages of having a broad pipeline is that we can [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1227.44s)]
*  sometimes spread the cost out of these people over multiple different products. So it doesn't [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1233.76s)]
*  become prohibitive. And it enables us to have, you know, 20 to 30 year veterans working in every area [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1239.36s)]
*  on our different products and people that have done very similar products before. So they know [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1246.56s)]
*  where all the potholes are and they know how to avoid those kind of things. We brought on, you know, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1253.1999999999998s)]
*  people as needed on the manufacturing side. We've created strategic relationships with firms that can [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1258.24s)]
*  help us in that. And we feel that that's the best way to go in the early phase. I'm not saying that [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1264.1599999999999s)]
*  we're going to do that all the way to commercialization. You know, as products [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1271.68s)]
*  are advancing, there is a time and a place where you may need to start developing in-house [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1278.16s)]
*  manufacturing capabilities. But certainly when we're doing, you know, animal testing and early [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1283.92s)]
*  human testing, you know, we're very efficient at managing that on an outsourced basis. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1290.48s)]
*  Yeah. Well, the approach seems to be, it seems to be working. You had a very busy year and I'm [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1296.0s)]
*  going to turn to my notes so that I don't miss anything here as I rattle off a few portage [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1301.8400000000001s)]
*  achievements over the course of the last 12 months. You've accelerated operations to achieve [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1309.04s)]
*  some milestones, including your recent NASDAQ listing, public offering, first patients dosed [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1314.48s)]
*  in studies of your port three lead assets, interim data from a phase two study of your port one [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1321.44s)]
*  platform. I'm sure I'm missing some big milestones that you would add to the list. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1328.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, there was a lot, lots of wood to chop, so to speak. That's a phrase Alan likes to [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1334.08s)]
*  use. You know, I think, you know, I highlight a few of the business achievements because I [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1338.72s)]
*  think that's critical to understand as we are planning to, you know, get more data, which is [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1344.88s)]
*  always nice for our clinical assets. But, you know, the company not too long ago was listed on the [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1350.64s)]
*  Canadian stock exchange. We were trading at 10 cents and it was majority owned by insiders, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1357.76s)]
*  which led to the challenge that there were very little trading of the stock. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1365.6s)]
*  So that made it difficult for institutions to get in. And as part of our strategy, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1371.68s)]
*  we wanted to grow the business as quickly as can and part of the best way to do that is to, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1380.4s)]
*  you know, attract partnerships with, you know, foundational biotech funds and do that. You know, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1386.56s)]
*  we were able to consolidate the shares. We were able to up list to NASDAQ and delist from Canada. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1394.24s)]
*  So it gets us on a major exchange. As part of that process, we filed a registration statement. We [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1399.36s)]
*  put a shelf in and we put an ATM, all the kind of tools to kind of attract institutional investors. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1405.6799999999998s)]
*  And then just recently we announced our first institutional round, NASDAQ, where we brought in [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1412.0s)]
*  enough resource to extend our runway so that we can deliver on the clinic side. So I can stop [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1418.56s)]
*  focusing on raising money and focus more of my time on designing clinical trials and interacting [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1424.72s)]
*  with the pharma companies. And, you know, we really set up the company for future growth. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1430.96s)]
*  We're able to attract, you know, good consortium investors in this round and really position the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1437.3600000000001s)]
*  company, you know, by issuing more stock, we improve the liquidity. We were recently added [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1444.56s)]
*  to the Russell index. So we really kind of fixed a lot on the business side to kind of enable the [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1449.2s)]
*  company to, you know, proceed to the next area of growth. You know, but, you know, even though we're [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1456.32s)]
*  a small, lean organization, we don't forget our day job. So while we were doing all that, you know, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1461.76s)]
*  we were enrolling patients and studies, getting new drugs into the clinic, you know, working with [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1466.96s)]
*  our partners and so on, because, you know, the real, you know, milestones for any business in [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1473.2s)]
*  our space is clinical data. And that's what we're laser focused on is how to get these trials going. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1481.6000000000001s)]
*  It's a little bit challenging with COVID, you know, that we work internationally, we're not [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1487.76s)]
*  just in the U.S. and different, you know, countries did better than others with respect to the COVID [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1492.56s)]
*  crisis. We definitely suffered some setbacks and delays on that front. But, you know, we're pushing [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1497.44s)]
*  drugs into human testing, we're trying to get as many patients on study as quickly as we can, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1505.44s)]
*  so we can get the data that people want to see to understand whether or not these drugs perform as [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1509.84s)]
*  well in the animals as they do in humans. That's really the critical thing. I mean, you know, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1515.6s)]
*  we didn't talk about this, but, you know, knowing which animal experiments are most likely [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1522.1599999999999s)]
*  going to translate to what you see in human, that's important, right? Because we really don't want to [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  waste anyone's time, effort or resources in doing human studies that don't have a good probability [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1533.4399999999998s)]
*  of success. So, you know, we focus a lot first on understanding, do we have a real drug? Does it have [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1539.1999999999998s)]
*  the right profile? At what dose do you see its effects? Can we achieve those doses in humans? [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1545.92s)]
*  What are the right studies to do? What are the right studies in humans? Because we're trying [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1551.92s)]
*  to plot the most efficient line to get us to the point where we can get these drugs commercialized, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1557.28s)]
*  and that's what we do. The business of biotech is brought to you in partnership with Cytiva. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1562.88s)]

*  So tell me, let's talk a little bit more, I guess, more specifically about some of those candidates. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1605.44s)]
*  Tell me about port two and port three, the invariant natural killer T cell agonists. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1613.04s)]
*  Why are they unique? What makes them sort of the object of your attention at this point? [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1618.16s)]
*  Yeah, thanks. This was the first products that we brought into the company. So we were introduced [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1625.52s)]
*  to the head of immunology at Oxford in the UK over a 20-year period. I collaborated with a [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1630.48s)]
*  nonprofit group, the Ludwig Institute, on these and developed five small molecule agonists, [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1637.04s)]
*  which means stimulators of a type of immune cell called INKT for short. That stands for invariant [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1644.8799999999999s)]
*  natural killer T cell. So that's a mouthful. I'm going to use INKTs from now on. And as you can [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1651.36s)]
*  imagine, it's got NK in it, and people sometimes get them confused with natural killer cells. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1657.52s)]
*  And it also has a T in it, and it has some features of a T cell as well. So it's this [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1664.08s)]
*  interesting cell type that bridges both two arms of the immune system that we think are very [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1669.84s)]
*  important in fighting cancer. The NK part, which is sort of the innate or the first line of defense [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1676.8s)]
*  against cancer, meaning that these cells can directly kill cancer. They sit in your tissue. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1684.6399999999999s)]
*  They're out there surveilling the body for cancer. I'll give you an example. In mice, this is how we [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1689.9199999999998s)]
*  typically try to understand things. So we knock out the cells. So we have two groups of mice, one [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1697.12s)]
*  that have INKT cells and one that don't. And then you give it a cancer challenge. And the animals [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1702.88s)]
*  that don't have these cells develop cancer, and the ones that do don't. So it tells you that these [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1708.8000000000002s)]
*  cells are pretty important. They're out there surveilling the body for cancer, and they're [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1714.96s)]
*  able to kind of clear a cancer challenge. So you have that kind of, which is the innate part of the [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1718.8000000000002s)]
*  immune system. They sit in the tissue. They monitor for abnormal cells. But what's also very [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1725.6000000000001s)]
*  interesting is they work to drive an adaptive immune response as well. So that adaptive part is, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1731.04s)]
*  you know, just like the immune response, you need to clear COVID or a virus, which involves, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1737.6s)]
*  and everyone seems to know more about immunology today than they knew two years ago. You know, [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1743.28s)]
*  it involves T cells and it involves antibodies and all that other stuff. The INKTs can actually [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1748.24s)]
*  promote an adaptive response, which includes activation of multiple other cell types, besides [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1755.36s)]
*  NK cells. And you get a B cell and a T cell response and so on and so forth. So you really [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1762.4799999999998s)]
*  have this really broad reprogramming of the immune response. But we're not done there. We talked a [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1768.7199999999998s)]
*  little bit about tumor microenvironment before. We also have some data that these agonists [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1774.6399999999999s)]
*  can reprogram the tumor microenvironment. So it takes some of the suppressor cells that are holding [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1780.64s)]
*  the immune system back and it down modulates those. So you're promoting all these good cells to fight [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1786.3200000000002s)]
*  cancer and you're decreasing some of the bad cells that prevent the immune system from clearing [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1793.76s)]
*  cancer. So it's pretty interesting stuff. And then we talked a little bit earlier about PD1 therapy. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1800.24s)]
*  Well, in fact, you can take a cancer cell. Now, PD1 antibodies tend to work better in tumors that [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1809.0400000000002s)]
*  express PD-L1. So that's obviously the target of the antibody. And we can take tumor cells [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1817.0400000000002s)]
*  in the B2 dish and expose them to our drug, the INKT agonist, PORT2. And we upregulate this PD-L1 [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1824.72s)]
*  on the surface. So we're essentially converting a tumor that's negative and wouldn't typically [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1833.52s)]
*  respond to a PD-1 inhibitor to one that's positive. And when you give our drug and the animal models, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1838.6399999999999s)]
*  you can see an animal that's resistant to PD-1, which is the standard of care, which is selling [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1847.12s)]
*  about $20 billion annually. Very potent drugs work great. You take an animal that doesn't respond to [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1852.4s)]
*  that drug. You give the combination of our drug and that same PD-1 therapy. And all of a sudden, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1858.88s)]
*  you restore sensitivity to that drug, which really is pretty interesting because not only [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1865.6000000000001s)]
*  a potential partner that works with us be able to sell our drug, we're going to make them sell [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1874.48s)]
*  more of their own PD-1. So there's a lot of commercial implications to these studies. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1879.92s)]
*  So in a nutshell, without going too crazy into the immunology, we're really excited about the [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1887.3600000000001s)]
*  mechanism here. It's different. It's not what many other companies are doing. It really represents [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1894.24s)]
*  a broad way of reprogramming that immune response in the tumor microenvironment and the tumor cell [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1901.76s)]
*  directly. And we've designed some really interesting trials to prove all those things [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1909.6s)]
*  in a single trial, in our first in human study. It's really somewhat unprecedented. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1916.48s)]
*  Where we are taking a drug, we're going to evaluate what's a safe dose. And then we go [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1921.6799999999998s)]
*  right into randomized studies where we compare our drug alone to a PD-1 to the combination of the two. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1927.9199999999998s)]
*  So you'll really get a good sense of why, do these drugs work by themselves, which they certainly do [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1936.24s)]
*  in the animals, and do they add anything to the current standard of care drugs beyond what they [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1942.96s)]
*  can achieve themselves? We're excited about those trials starting and getting to some of these [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1949.2s)]
*  endpoints as quickly as we can. Yeah, a lot of wood to chop yet, as Alan Shaw would say. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1957.2s)]
*  So PD-1 to start with, what about other combinations? What are the combinations [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1963.12s)]
*  you're looking at? Obviously, you can't tackle them all in clinical studies in one fell swoop, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1969.36s)]
*  but is there the potential for additional layers of clinical study of more high target? [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1974.56s)]
*  Like I said, I'll try to give you an analogy. And since I worked on cars, [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1983.76s)]
*  I'm going to use in a car analogy. Getting an immune response against cancer is like driving [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1988.24s)]
*  a race car. You need three components to do well in a race. You need to have an expert driver. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=1994.0s)]
*  So you need to be able to instruct the immune system on what's a cancer cell, what's a healthy [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2002.16s)]
*  cell, because we don't want the immune system attacking all your normal tissues. You need to [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2008.88s)]
*  have somebody pressing on the gas. That's priming and boosting the immune response. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2014.72s)]
*  And these INKT things really press on the gas. They do a fantastic job of that. And then lastly, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2020.48s)]
*  you need someone taking your foot off the brake, because if your brakes are locked, the car's not [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2027.68s)]
*  really going to go that far. And that's what the PD-1 drugs do. They take the foot off the brake. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2033.68s)]
*  So when you think about that, we want to make sure that every patient gets a little bit of all three. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2038.96s)]
*  And they may have some already before they come to us, or they may not. And that's kind of what [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2045.76s)]
*  our job is to try to figure out. So the PD-1 combo is a natural one, because we want something [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2051.76s)]
*  to take the foot off the brake. Now, is that the only checkpoint or brake signal out there? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2059.2s)]
*  Absolutely not. But right now, it's the most commonly used with approvals in 16 different [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2064.48s)]
*  tumor types. So that's the natural first step. We're clearly interested in studying combinations [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2070.64s)]
*  with other things that remove the brake signal. As far as the expert driver, so we didn't really [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2077.2799999999997s)]
*  talk about port three, but three is a unique co-formulation of our INKT agonist, the same one [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2085.6s)]
*  in port two, with the tumor antigen. So the tumor antigen is a way of kind of steering the immune [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2094.72s)]
*  system on what it should attack and what it should leave alone. So we have that combination [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2101.2s)]
*  in a single product. That's part of port three. And we started that clinical trial. And we were [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2106.88s)]
*  really lucky to receive a grant from the EU to develop that product. So it's a kind of, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2110.8s)]
*  you know, a neat, neat way to develop multiple products. We picked our antigen as NYESA1. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2117.6000000000004s)]
*  If you've heard of that antigen, it's expressed as a cancer testes antigen. It's expressed in a [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2124.88s)]
*  whole bunch of different tumor types. We have IP against that antigen and all the other known [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2129.1200000000003s)]
*  antigens too. So if we see proof of concept with that product, we can go and quickly put four or [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2134.64s)]
*  five more new products into the clinic with different antigens. And then lastly is, you know, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2141.12s)]
*  kind of a new strategy, which this, you know, recent fundraise is enabling us to start thinking [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2147.92s)]
*  about, which is cell therapy. I don't know how interested you are in cell therapy and how much [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2153.8399999999997s)]
*  you followed, but there's a lot of excitement about cell therapy. Certain blood tumors, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2159.84s)]
*  we're seeing response rates 70, 80, 90%. Hasn't been so lucky in the context of solid tumors, [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2166.8s)]
*  right? Because these tumors sit in a micro environment and, you know, they're easy to [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2174.8s)]
*  attack when they're floating around in the blood and you inject the cells in the blood. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2178.5600000000004s)]
*  Harder when they have to get into an organ and fight the cancer. But there's been some really [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2183.28s)]
*  interesting work on this cell type in, as a cell therapy. So I'm sure you heard of CAR T cells. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2188.72s)]
*  You might've heard of CAR NK cells, but there's now CAR NK T cells. Okay. Part about this [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2195.2799999999997s)]
*  particular cell therapy, it's off the shelf, right? These are not cells that you have to take out of [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2203.12s)]
*  the body and expand them and then we give back the same cells to the same patient. These are cells [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2208.0s)]
*  that you can get universal donors, expand them and then have an off the shelf product. So we've [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2213.2s)]
*  begun to study combinations with cell therapy and we've seen very interesting kind of results. One [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2218.24s)]
*  is we can help during the manufacturing process. So while the cells are, you know, being manufactured, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2225.52s)]
*  we can help create more cells and help them educate them to be more cancer fighting. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2231.52s)]
*  And we're starting to think about studying them in combination when the cells are re-infused to the [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2237.12s)]
*  patient. Because not only can we activate the transplanted cells, we can activate a lot of the [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2242.64s)]
*  endogenous cells as well. So those are some of the initial thinkings on combos. You know, I still [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2248.0s)]
*  firmly believe it's not going to be a single product, right? That's going to help everybody. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2254.4s)]
*  And the goal is to try to rationally design combinations, understanding the immune system, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2258.72s)]
*  understand what's worked in the past, what hasn't worked and how we can try to advance the field. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2264.56s)]
*  Yeah. You've got to have a, so with that philosophy in mind, you've got to have a pretty [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2269.92s)]
*  strong level of confidence, I would say. I'm assuming in your ability to make good calls on [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2279.04s)]
*  winners and potential losers. I mean, I would think anyway. So tell me about that. What goes into, [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2286.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, Dr. Ian Walters' thought process around, okay, here's a combination that I think we should [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2292.4s)]
*  invest our hard-earned resources in. Here's a combination that perhaps I wouldn't touch with a [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2298.72s)]
*  10-foot pole. Yeah. You know, it's interesting. I mean, developing a drug, and it's funny, a friend [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2304.0s)]
*  of mine uses an analogy, is like driving a truck full of gold across a minefield, right? You know, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2311.2s)]
*  you got something valuable when you start, but if you can't go to the other side, it doesn't really [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2319.52s)]
*  matter. Right. And, you know, our team, you know, has been involved in a lot of drugs. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2323.84s)]
*  You know, over the years in my career alone, I've helped five cancer drugs get to the other side [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2333.76s)]
*  and get a breed. And you learn a lot about, you know, how to do that process. So picking, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2339.6800000000003s)]
*  you know, either drugs or technology to bring in or trials design, all that stuff, [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2348.32s)]
*  is an exhaustive process where you try to evaluate all the data. And a good mentor of mine always [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2354.0s)]
*  reinforced more data doesn't enable better decisions. Right. You get stuck. And oftentimes, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2361.6s)]
*  I saw this in the big pharma space and just, well, yeah, but if we had more data, maybe we would do [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2366.96s)]
*  things this way. And then you could be in that position forever and ever. And just saying we [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2373.28s)]
*  need more data, we need more data. And you get stuck and you don't really advance stuff. And [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2378.96s)]
*  what's nice about being in this entrepreneurial environment is, you know, you could take bigger [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2384.1600000000003s)]
*  risks and, you know, and you base that on your decision making and your experience. So, you know, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2389.1200000000003s)]
*  I would say in the field of drug development, about 20% of it is picking the right stuff. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2397.44s)]
*  The other 80% is knowing what to do when things don't go right. Because it's not a straight line. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2406.48s)]
*  Things never go exactly like you planned them. And then the question is, what next? [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2414.0800000000004s)]
*  What do we do? You know, we thought this experiment would do would say something and it doesn't. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2420.8s)]
*  Does that mean we call it quits? Does that mean there's another experiment that we could do? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2426.88s)]
*  Does that mean we rethink everything we know? And how do you navigate, you know, the ups and downs? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2432.2400000000002s)]
*  I think that's really, you know, the majority of what it takes to develop successful products. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2439.6800000000003s)]
*  And again, you know, having been down this process so many times and bringing diversity [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2446.32s)]
*  of opinions to the table really help us to kind of make good decisions. So I don't know [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2453.04s)]
*  if that answered your question, but, you know, it is definitely a challenging job. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2460.08s)]
*  I really appreciate the opportunity. And this is kind of back to my introduction where my, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2467.2s)]
*  not only my medicine and my science experience comes to play, but also my business experience. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2472.56s)]
*  And, you know, effectively leading these teams to make these difficult decisions and to figure [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2478.48s)]
*  things out. And we know that not everything is going to succeed. Right. So from the get go, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2484.32s)]
*  and I apologize for the sirens in the background. That's okay. As long as it's not your building [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2491.76s)]
*  that's on fire. We're good. You know, we said that we wanted to have a bunch of programs that we can [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2496.0s)]
*  do because we, you know, we see this peril where companies only have one product. And even though [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2504.8s)]
*  the data is saying, you know, you probably should call it quits, you know, the scientific founders, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2511.36s)]
*  the investors, nobody wants to walk away. Going and throwing good money after bad, hoping that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2517.1200000000003s)]
*  they can find it's like, it's like playing, you know, poker and you're waiting, you know, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2522.8s)]
*  you keep betting with the hopes that you're going to pull a card at the very end. You know, that's [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2527.6800000000003s)]
*  not the way we operate. We have a lot of things going. We take a very structured and disciplined [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2532.16s)]
*  approach. And if we can't, and we think that the probability is very low, that, you know, a given [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2537.52s)]
*  product or strategies to succeed, you know, we'll try to monetize it, but we're not going to put our [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2544.64s)]
*  resources towards that. We're going to focus our resources where we think we have the highest [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2549.8399999999997s)]
*  probability and chance of success. Yeah. And if the, and if the goal, the truck full of gold taps [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2553.8399999999997s)]
*  a mine along the way, you get, get out of the truck and scoop up what you can and figure out [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2560.16s)]
*  what's next. Absolutely. I don't know if that's a, I don't know if that's an accurate, you know, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2564.08s)]
*  parallel with that analogy. It is. I mean, like I said, you know, it is a difficult business, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2570.16s)]
*  right? I mean, if you look at the pure stats on developing drugs, I think one in 10,000 succeed. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2578.0s)]
*  The average cost is $2 billion to develop a drug. You know, this is a high risk, high reward [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2584.16s)]
*  business. And, you know, there's a lot of people that made money on biotech companies. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2589.44s)]
*  You can discharge risk efficiently and, you know, you can minimize the amount of money that you're [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2597.44s)]
*  putting at risk at any one point until you have more confidence, which is what we do, you know, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  with these early experiments. And then you're really, you know, then focusing the larger [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2609.92s)]
*  investment on things that have a much higher probability of success. And we don't need [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2615.84s)]
*  everything to succeed for our investors to make money. Right. So, you know, we think we're in a [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2620.32s)]
*  good business and we think we have developed a good strategy to, to return, you know, money to [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2626.88s)]
*  our investors. And we've shown that we can do that again with companies like Biolavent. We can do it [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2633.84s)]
*  again. Excellent. Well, we're running short on time here, Dr. Walters. But before I let you go, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2639.36s)]
*  I do want to give you an opportunity to just give me an update on what we can expect to see next [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2646.56s)]
*  out of Portage. If there are any newsworthy coming up or any points you'd like to bring [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2651.1200000000003s)]
*  up that we should be looking out for. Yeah. So, look, I think Portage today is a lot different [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2656.2400000000002s)]
*  than Portage even six or eight months ago. So we're now, you know, a NASDAQ listed company [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2663.36s)]
*  with institutional backing with two years of runway in the bank, which will enable us to take [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2670.1600000000003s)]
*  advantage of the pipeline we built and the experience of our team in doing this. So I think [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2677.04s)]
*  we're in a unique position right now where with our diverse pipeline, and we didn't even get to [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2683.84s)]
*  talk about things beyond Port 2 and 3. I know, yeah. We'll... Other ports and other technologies, [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2689.28s)]
*  maybe for another time. Yes, well, I was just thinking that, you know, as you know, Alan is a [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2696.32s)]
*  regular guest of mine on this podcast. He comes on quite frequently. Between he and you, part two [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2702.2400000000002s)]
*  is certainly in the works. Great. Yeah. Now, Alan has made a huge contribution to our success. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2708.48s)]
*  So, you know, we're in a position now where in the next 18 to 24 months, you know, we're expecting, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2715.2s)]
*  you know, greater than 10 phase two trials to read out. Yeah. Any one of which can be [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2722.4s)]
*  transformational to the company. So the key, you know, with all these business moves that we made [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2728.0s)]
*  was to position the company for growth. You know, we have now a much broader institutional base that, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2733.6s)]
*  you know, should we see the next cure to cancer come through our desk, which, you know, we're [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2740.48s)]
*  always reviewing stuff, we now have, you know, a bigger backing to kind of take advantage of that. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2745.04s)]
*  We have enough resources now to take advantage of what we currently have. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2750.8s)]
*  Our goal is really to put one to two new drugs into human testing every year. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2755.92s)]
*  You know, just to benchmark that, that was the same goal that BMS Oncology had, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2761.28s)]
*  you know, and here we are, a small little biotech entrepreneurial company. We're able to kind of [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2765.44s)]
*  do that through our creative model. So, you know, as far as looking forward, you know, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2769.92s)]
*  stay tuned, look at all the oncology meetings, we should be there with our data, with our products. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2775.36s)]
*  We continue to meet with pharma partners and other strategic partners to kind of advance our mission. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2781.04s)]
*  We continue to evaluate new products and the hope that we can make a dent in this space. I mean, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2786.88s)]
*  you know, everybody's been touched by cancer. You know, we're reminded every day, I just went [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2793.28s)]
*  to a funeral last week of, you know, a friend, my age, young kids, who's dying, which reminds me, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2797.76s)]
*  my work is not done. So, you know, there's a lot of, you know, people out there that need our help. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2806.0s)]
*  So my goal is to try to do the best I can to advance exciting technologies, get them to the [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2814.0s)]
*  patients who need it, and, you know, to try to make a dent in my lifetime. My dad doesn't know why I [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2820.0800000000004s)]
*  don't want to be a doctor anymore. I don't understand it. I said, look, Dad, I've got five drugs approved [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2826.4s)]
*  over the course of my early career. I still got room to go. And I helped way more people than I [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2833.84s)]
*  could have helped as a practicing physician, and I'm not done yet. Yeah. Well, I respect the work [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2839.92s)]
*  that you're doing. Dr. Walters, I thank you for it. It's very important work. And I congratulate you [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmQHDHOOsoE&t=2847.12s)]
