Video Description: Success at multimodal, multi-indication, deep-pipelined Incyte—where commercial operations are as familiar as pre-discovery activity is—begins at the earliest opportunity to achieve research and discovery efficiencies. The company’s a bit larger than those we typically cover on the Business of Biotech, and that’s okay! Sometimes, the smartest approach to creating your own masterpiece is to study the masters. On this episode of the podcast, we sit down with Incyte’s Group Vice President and head of its Inflammation and AutoImmunity Group, Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D. for a dissection of the company’s approach to the comprehensive and efficient R&D that leads to repeated clinical and commercial success.

# Multimodal R&D Management With Incyte's Jim Lee, M.D., Ph.D.
**Life Science Connect - Business of Biotech:** [January 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI)
*  The business of biotech is produced by LifeScience Connect and its community of learning, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=0.0s)]
*  solving, and sourcing resources for biopharma decision makers. If you're working on biologics [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=5.2s)]
*  process development and manufacturing challenges, you need to swing by bioprocessonline.com. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=11.44s)]
*  If you're trying to stay ahead of the cell or gene therapy curve, visit cellandgene.com. When it's [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=17.12s)]
*  time to map out your clinical course, let clinicalleader.com help. And if optimizing [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=22.72s)]
*  outsourcing decisions is what you're after, check out outsourcepharma.com. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=28.4s)]
*  We're LifeScience Connect, and we're here to help. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=33.199999999999996s)]
*  Wide-ranging success is no stranger to the pharma company Insight. The company boasts eight [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=40.16s)]
*  approvals, all but one in its oncology, inflammation, blood disorder, and GVHD portfolios. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=46.32s)]
*  The most recent commercial win for the company has come from its most recent major endeavor into [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=52.64s)]
*  the dermatology space. That effort has been fueled in large part by the addition of Dr. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=58.24s)]
*  Jim Lee, Group VP and Head of Inflammation and Autoimmunity at the company since 2018. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=63.6s)]
*  Right about the time, it dove headlong into the dermatology space. I'm Matt Piller. This is the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  business of biotech. And on today's episode, we're sitting down with Dr. Lee for an inside look at [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=76.08s)]
*  managing R&D and pipeline progress in a large multimodal multi-indication company. Dr. Lee, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=81.52s)]
*  welcome to the show. Thank you. It's nice to be here. It's really nice to have you. I appreciate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=89.11999999999999s)]
*  you coming on. And as I mentioned, Insight is decidedly a multimodal company having successfully [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=94.16s)]
*  developed and commercialized both large and small molecule therapies in those multiple indications [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=101.12s)]
*  that I mentioned. And I want to get a sense from your perspective how this multimodal kind of broad [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=108.16s)]
*  indication environment impacts the research function at a larger company, larger than we [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=117.12s)]
*  typically cover, frankly, on the business of biotech company like Insight. So I guess I'd start [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=124.96s)]
*  at the sort of the highest level. Why, like what's strategic at Insight about this multimodal [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=131.52s)]
*  approach? Why not just focus on biologics or just small molecules or maybe just focus on [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=139.36s)]
*  oncology or a specific indication? That's a great question. And it really comes down to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  our DNA at Insight and that's keeping the patient out in front and center. But we're trying to figure [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=151.44s)]
*  out how we can develop a drug for patients. But utilizing our science, we have a great group of [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=158.96s)]
*  biologists, of chemists. And so we're agnostic to the modality, whether it's a small molecule [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=166.0s)]
*  or a biologic. We first look at the diseases we incorporate and come up with a list of potential [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=175.12s)]
*  targets that can help these patients. And then we figure out a way or try to figure out a way to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=182.24s)]
*  develop a drug for these patients. And sometimes it's a small molecule that you apply onto your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=188.24s)]
*  skin. Other times it would be a biologic that you inject in yourself. So it's really, we seem to be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=195.12s)]
*  taking a multimodal approach. And it's really because we utilize the best science to try to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=203.28s)]
*  figure out or try to develop and get drugs approved for patients. That's really how we think. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  That's our approach that we take. And as a result, it does look like we take or look at, develop [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=217.12s)]
*  multiple types of drugs, biologic small molecules. But it's just the opposite. We look at the patient [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=225.04s)]
*  and then we figure out what the best approach should be. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=232.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's a logical approach. One that can certainly create [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=236.16s)]
*  compli- not complications, but complexity, I guess. Right? Like, I mean, you, when you, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=244.32s)]
*  when you take a patient first approach and then you pursue the modality or the target or the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=248.96s)]
*  indication that makes best sense. And you do that in an iterative fashion in multiple, you know, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=254.72s)]
*  multiple places with multiple patient groups, you end up with, you know, the necessity of a lot of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=263.04s)]
*  intellectual property, a lot of expertise in different areas, right? Like I'm thinking at it [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=268.64s)]
*  from a very simplistic point of view. And I'm curious how that, how that impacts the research [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=273.44s)]
*  function. I mean, I want to get a sense for how the research function gets structured at Insight [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=281.12s)]
*  as a result of that will choose the best, most efficient path to patient centricity. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=287.52s)]
*  That's another great question. And- [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=295.2s)]
*  Is it clear? I mean, you understand where I'm going with that question? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=297.36s)]
*  I hear you because you're right. It's as, as you try to develop multiple options for patients, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=300.16s)]
*  that, that does increase the complexity of the things that we do because of all of the, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=310.72s)]
*  of the drugs, all of the various pathways that, that need to be considered. So, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=316.16s)]
*  it does create complexity. And the way we address that complexity is to structure ourselves by [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=321.44s)]
*  function. So, within the R&D function, we're, you know, basically broken up into, you know, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=328.56s)]
*  clinical development, research, which include biology and the chemistry. And then we also have [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=335.76s)]
*  our chemistry manufacturer controls, is what we call the CMC group. And so that's how we're [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=342.96s)]
*  broken up by function. But, but in terms of the project work itself, that's really done via, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=348.24s)]
*  you know, a matrix environment. We have representatives from all the different functions, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  clinical, regulatory, et cetera, that contribute and make sure that, that we have considered all [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=361.6s)]
*  the critical things when you develop drugs. And obviously those change depending on the stage of [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=369.12s)]
*  the drug. But, but so we have, you know, in terms of how we're structured, we have the functions. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=375.28s)]
*  And then in terms of the processes that we use, we use a matrix team-based approach to develop [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  drugs. We think that's the most efficient, at least for us, obviously other companies take [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=387.11999999999995s)]
*  slightly different approaches, but for Insight, that's been successful and we continue to use [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=393.76s)]
*  that approach. So there's not like an oncology R&D department and a, you know, a dermatology R&D [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=399.12s)]
*  department. It's- No, so we do have therapeutic area focuses in the clinical development group. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=406.48s)]
*  But, but for the most part, that's really the only area where we have separate groups, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  just because of the specialized nature of the different disease, diseases that we study. So [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=420.56s)]
*  obviously oncology, hematology, those are all very specialized areas. And so, so for the clinical [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=427.52s)]
*  development stage, we do have those different therapeutic areas. That's one of the therapeutic [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  areas that I head up, the inflammation and autoimmunity group. But all the other groups [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=438.96s)]
*  really are broken up by, by function chemistry. We don't have a separate inflammation, autoimmunity [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=445.2s)]
*  chemistry group. The chemistry team works on different projects. And if it happens to be an [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=450.8s)]
*  inflammation autoimmunity group, that's great, but they don't belong into that sort of separate, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=457.76s)]
*  distinct function. It's really only the clinical group that is broken up by therapeutic area. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=462.72s)]
*  Does that create a very specific, I guess, sort of persona? Like, you know, let's say that you're [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=468.16s)]
*  looking at adding some research scientists. Does that approach dictate sort of the approach that [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=477.12s)]
*  the company takes in terms of the specific research scientists that it pursues? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=484.8s)]
*  I guess it does have an impact on, on the type of talent that you're looking for to join the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=490.0s)]
*  R&D departments? Absolutely. And so, you know, when you, when you're in a therapeutic area, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=494.88s)]
*  get experience, that's the type of person that we want to bring on board from the outside, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=500.4s)]
*  to join our team. You know, we do bring in people who are less experienced and, and obviously they [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=507.03999999999996s)]
*  get training, they have exposure to the therapeutic area. But when, when we look outside for external [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=513.84s)]
*  candidates, we definitely want experience in the therapeutic area of interest. And in my case, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=520.56s)]
*  when I hire, I look for people with experience in the dermatology space. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=528.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, which you have plenty of. I'm sure you can recognize that experience in a hurry given, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=533.04s)]
*  given your, we'll get into that in a little bit, some of your experience in that dermatology space. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=537.84s)]
*  But I'm curious also about the research strategy there. I guess the molecular discovery slash [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=542.0s)]
*  acquisition slash partnership strategy, you know, there, there are a million ways to build a pipeline. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=550.8s)]
*  You know, you can, you can turn to academia and acquire novel molecules that are newly discovered. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=556.56s)]
*  You can buy novel molecules that are at any point in their, in their development, design development, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=563.1199999999999s)]
*  or even, even clinical stages. You can rely solely on internal discovery and kind of come to market [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=569.1199999999999s)]
*  with your own thing. What's the modus operandi at Insight? Well, as you mentioned, there are [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=577.4399999999999s)]
*  many different approaches to build out your pipeline and then to continue to grow your [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=585.84s)]
*  pipeline. And our main focus is we have such good scientists, biologists, chemists, that the core, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=591.44s)]
*  most of our projects, most of our molecules are developed internally. They're identified [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=600.24s)]
*  internally and then we work on them. And, and, and many of those projects get into the clinic, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=605.9200000000001s)]
*  into human studies. But we also recognize that, you know, not everything you work on is going to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  be successful. We are doing research and so we're doing experiments and we don't know what the [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=620.56s)]
*  results of those experiments are going to look like. So we understand there's always going to [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=626.64s)]
*  be an attrition rate internally for our projects. And so we have to also supplement our internal [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=630.0s)]
*  research with, you know, potential business development, licensing or acquisitions, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=637.12s)]
*  collaborations, as you say, with academic sites to look for, understand potentially new targets [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=644.88s)]
*  for the diseases of interest. So we, we take, we pretty much take all of the things that you just [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=652.64s)]
*  said. We do consider that, but our main, our main, the core of what we do is really internal, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=658.5600000000001s)]
*  developing molecules, getting them to the clinic and developing them ourselves. But we also [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=665.2s)]
*  recognize that you would be foolish not to look at the external environment for potential [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=670.72s)]
*  partnerships. Yeah. You mentioned, you briefly mentioned failure. And I'm curious about this [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=677.36s)]
*  failure being the sort of the, I don't want to say the norm, but the common denominator, right? In [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=685.36s)]
*  early drug research and discovery. Failure is an interesting thing in this space because [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=692.08s)]
*  it's not always black and white, right? There are varying degrees of potential for, for [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=699.12s)]
*  therapeutics at the discovery stage and decisions have to be made from a business perspective about, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=707.0400000000001s)]
*  you know, is this close enough to failure to shelve it, to can it, or is this, you know, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=712.88s)]
*  maybe close enough to showing signs of potential success to maybe put it on a back burner and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=719.2s)]
*  revisit it, or, or, you know, maybe put some secondary resources on it while we pursue [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=724.88s)]
*  more promising options. It's a very broad kind of gray, gray area. And when you have that, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=730.1600000000001s)]
*  and when you have individuals, humans, human beings who are invested in their, in their daily lives [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=736.4000000000001s)]
*  in a specific project, you have inevitably, you know, emotional and professional connections [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=743.28s)]
*  to those projects that sometimes get shuffled, sometimes get canned, sometimes get shelved. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=751.2s)]
*  So it makes me curious in an environment like, like the one at Insight, where there's a lot of [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=756.64s)]
*  activity going on and a lot of different modalities and a lot of different indications, what sort of [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=761.6800000000001s)]
*  competition, and healthy, I don't mean this in a negative way, but what sort of healthy competition [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=767.84s)]
*  may or may not exist at Insight for the resources to move a project forward? [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=774.1600000000001s)]
*  And I think you mentioned it, that we are very emotionally invested into the projects that we're [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=781.6s)]
*  working on. And the reason for that is we learn about the disease state, about the patients and [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=790.4s)]
*  the suffering, the unmet needs. And as we progress a project, you know, it's natural to [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=795.6s)]
*  invest some emotion into that. And so that does complicate decision-making. And it's a good thing [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=803.6800000000001s)]
*  that it complicates decision-making, right? Because we always want to keep the patient front and center. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=811.2s)]
*  And, but when, as you say, when there's some data, you know, we run a study, and perhaps the study is [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=815.6s)]
*  not what we expected, what we'd hoped for, that can, or that leads to decision-making in terms of [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=824.16s)]
*  prioritization. Do you continue? Do you invest more resources? Or do you then terminate or hold the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=831.28s)]
*  project and deploy those resources into another important area? And, you know, those are questions [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=839.6s)]
*  that we all struggle with, you know, throughout my 25-year career at various companies. It's an [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=848.08s)]
*  ongoing challenge to, you know, make that decision. But ultimately, you go back to data, and you really [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  try to make a data-driven decision, looking at the data objectively, and really setting aside [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=863.2800000000001s)]
*  the emotion, the biases, even though it can be very painful for many individuals, knowing that [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=870.96s)]
*  you're walking away from a disease. So, but if you take the data and look at it objectively, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=877.84s)]
*  if it's not going to really help the patients, I think that has to be part of decision-making. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=885.2800000000001s)]
*  If the data isn't good enough where it's going to help the patients, then you have to make the [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=891.12s)]
*  decision that, obviously, you should stop that program and deploy and focus on another disease, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=896.4s)]
*  another program that can help either the same set of patients or perhaps a different disease [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=904.72s)]
*  condition. So that's how we think about it. In terms of that creating any internal competition, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=912.24s)]
*  it really doesn't, because as long as the organization is really focused on patients, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=919.92s)]
*  I think everyone can agree and does agree that we've made the right decision. And then, you know, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=924.8s)]
*  any potential competition among resources or for resources within the organization, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=932.8000000000001s)]
*  they really never materialize. And so, I think that's one of the things that Insight does so well, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=938.48s)]
*  is, you know, we're on it together, we're one team, and when we do make a decision, yes, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=943.84s)]
*  certain individuals, certain project team members will be disappointed. But we get over that, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=950.72s)]
*  we move on, and then we focus on trying to help other patients. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=955.92s)]
*  Mike Farris Yeah, sort of the old saying, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=960.0799999999999s)]
*  and God, we trust all others bring data, all others must bring data, right? I want to try to [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=962.9599999999999s)]
*  get a sense for, you know, obviously without physically being there and seeing the quote-unquote [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=968.4799999999999s)]
*  operation, I want to ask you to try to help give us an illustration of what the R&D function at [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=973.36s)]
*  Insight looks like. So maybe share some stats, if you can, around like people and facilities and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=981.6s)]
*  just what it looks like there, like what it takes to keep this big multimodal, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=989.9200000000001s)]
*  multi-indication engine on its toes. Mike Farris [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=994.72s)]
*  So we have approximately 2,400 employees spread across three continents, countries, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=997.52s)]
*  so Europe, North America, and Japan. A little over 1,000 of those 2,400 patients are scientists [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1005.12s)]
*  and work in the R&D space. Our main R&D hub is here in Wilmington, Delaware, where we have two [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1012.4s)]
*  laboratory buildings, and many of us, even though we're in the research space, many of us don't [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1019.52s)]
*  work in the laboratory buildings. And so it's a very resource-heavy and intensive company. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1026.6399999999999s)]
*  We spend probably 44, 47% of our revenue. We actually reinvest that into R&D. So we're one [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1035.12s)]
*  of those companies that, you know, we put a lot of resources into developing these drugs. And so it's [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1045.28s)]
*  a very large part of the insight culture. It's a large part of the organization. And so if you work [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1052.56s)]
*  in the R&D space like I do, it's a great place to be. Mike Farris [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1061.28s)]
*  Just a quick follow-up on that. I'm curious, you know, you can, to the extent that you're able or [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1065.52s)]
*  willing to share, when you came on in 2018, as I said, you came on as the head of inflammation [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1070.48s)]
*  and autoimmunity at the company. Your appearance on the scene kind of coincided with an added [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1076.32s)]
*  focus on dermatology. When a new program comes into view at Insight, is it immediately given the [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  same access to those, you know, that 47 plus percent of resource to execute its job? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1095.12s)]
*  Mike Farris It's eventually, it does get there. You know, it's like any research project. Earlier on, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1104.48s)]
*  there's healthy skepticism, as there should be in terms of the potential for that project. And as [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1113.6799999999998s)]
*  you generate data and the data looks very promising, then obviously the company has invested a lot more [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1120.0s)]
*  resources into the dermatology space as well as other immunology projects. And so just to give you [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1129.04s)]
*  an example, when I joined the company five years ago, I think in my group there were five of us, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1135.28s)]
*  and within the larger inflammation, autoimmunity space within the various functions, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1141.44s)]
*  I think there were a total of 50 people working on these projects. And right now, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1147.2s)]
*  I think we have over 300 people on the project. And so it's been a steady growth. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1150.96s)]
*  And at various milestones, when we've looked at the data and the data was very good, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1158.0s)]
*  we've obviously, Insight has obviously invested a lot more resources into the space because of [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  the opportunity to help patients. Dr. John B. Daly [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1171.84s)]
*  Yeah. Just to wrap up sort of this section on sort of the, I guess, illustration or description of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1174.08s)]
*  the R&D function at Insight. If you were looking at, I guess, if you could go back in time and give [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1181.76s)]
*  Jim Lee, Dr. Jim Lee and his more formative early years of R&D management, specific to management, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1190.48s)]
*  like managing the departments, managing the people, if you could give yourself some advice going into [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1198.4s)]
*  this endeavor, what would it be? And I'm sure we could probably go very long on this, but maybe [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1204.8s)]
*  give us some of your best nuggets. Dr. Jim Lee [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think knowing what I know now, what would I tell my earlier self? I think it's, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  just can always stay on top of the science, stay on top of the research, not only what you're [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1221.12s)]
*  working on, but others are working on because you just don't know when that next opportunity [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1226.6399999999999s)]
*  will come up or present itself. And whether it's an internal discovery or another company [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1233.04s)]
*  approaching you, having the broad breadth as well as expertise in our space as immunology, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1239.6s)]
*  that's going to serve you well. And it's really about following the science, understanding [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1250.56s)]
*  all of the scientific pathways, the pathogenesis of the various diseases, because [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1256.56s)]
*  science is a slow process. I mean, if you think about it, JAK inhibitors were discovered probably [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1261.52s)]
*  30 some years ago, and only about five or six years ago, was it really observed that it could [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1267.36s)]
*  help a disease called vitiligo. And so it took a long time, 25 years, before someone connected the [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  JAK-STAT pathway to actually working in a disease, a condition like vitiligo. So that's the advice [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1282.56s)]
*  I would give my younger self is always stay on top of the science, always continue to read and look [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1290.0s)]
*  both internally and externally at new pathways that can help patients. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1296.16s)]
*  Dr. Jim Lees Yeah, very good. Like I said, I want to get into a bit of the story about how you came [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1300.24s)]
*  on the scene at Insight. And in order to do that, we need to sort of take a retrospective of Dr. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1306.24s)]
*  Jim Lees' career. So your previous three posts were on the derm space, as we mentioned, you were [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1311.76s)]
*  CMO at Graceway Pharmaceuticals, VP and Head of Clinical Medical Dermatology at Stiefel, Stiefel, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1317.68s)]
*  Stiefel? Dr. Jim Lees Stiefel. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1325.52s)]
*  Dr. Jim Lees Stiefel. Stiefel. You need to brush up on my German. I think that's German. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1326.72s)]
*  Dr. Jim Lees That's correct. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1331.2s)]
*  Dr. Jim Lees And you were Chief Medical Officer at Dermavant Sciences. So as I said, it's really no [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1331.92s)]
*  coincidence that you would join Insight at this juncture, just prior to its establishment of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1339.28s)]
*  Insight Dermatology. So tell us the story, I guess, of that move to Insight, the company's [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1345.36s)]
*  subsequent focus on dermatology and where this head of inflammation and autoimmunity [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1352.64s)]
*  role at the company kind of intersects with the dermatology effort. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1359.1200000000001s)]
*  Dr. Jim Lees No, I, you know, I always say it's better to be lucky than good. And, you know, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1363.44s)]
*  opportunities arise. And if it's a good time for you to consider these new opportunities, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1368.8000000000002s)]
*  then then you really should consider yourself very lucky. And then that was the case when, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1376.3200000000002s)]
*  when Insight approached me five years ago, a little over five years ago, actually, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1381.04s)]
*  they had an opening, you know, for the head of the inflammation autoimmunity group. And so when I [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1385.12s)]
*  looked into the opportunity and learn more about Insight, I saw that it really matched up with [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1392.96s)]
*  what I was looking for. And that is a company that's patient focused, that has excellent science, [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1399.92s)]
*  and, and have good molecules to work on. And so that that's those are the main reasons why I [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1405.52s)]
*  joined Insight. And it's been, it's been a great five years, I'm actually very, I feel very [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1413.44s)]
*  fortunate to have this opportunity to develop drugs, we've gotten two approvals with Rexalibut [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1419.28s)]
*  cream, we're advancing other other drugs, hopefully we can get approved in the next few years. And so, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1425.1200000000001s)]
*  you know, it's actually, for me, it matched up perfectly with what I was what I was looking for. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1431.84s)]
*  And to your early question, you know, how did that, that, you know, sort of line up, or what did my [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1437.52s)]
*  previous experience do? Well, you know, when you work in the field, I'm not a dermatologist, I [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1444.32s)]
*  actually was going to be an academic ophthalmologist. That's how I started my training after my MD PhD, [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1450.16s)]
*  and realized that I probably to focus in on research, I probably should have should get out [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  of a surgical subspecialty. And so I finished up in internal medicine, and happened to to start [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1463.76s)]
*  working at 3M on asthma studies, of all things, worked on asthma studies for a couple years, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1469.6s)]
*  and then was able to to work start working on a topical product called Aldera, which got three [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1476.72s)]
*  approvals, basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis, and general torworts. And that was my foray [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1483.52s)]
*  over 22, 23 years ago into the dermatology space. And as I've been, I've just been very fortunate [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1490.96s)]
*  to have been able to work on at companies that focus in dermatology, but also on some great [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1498.96s)]
*  products as well. And all of that sort of helped me really look at this insight opportunity and say, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1505.68s)]
*  wow, this is a great opportunity. It's a great company with great molecules. And so again, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1512.8s)]
*  it was just my good fortune to have this opportunity to come up when it did. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1518.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it makes me curious. You mentioned a couple of times there in your response, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1522.48s)]
*  the great molecules, right? And when you're a scientist and you have the opportunity to [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1526.96s)]
*  work on great molecules, it's obviously intriguing. But it makes me curious about [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1532.24s)]
*  when you were in that sort of recruiting stage and getting a look at the company and rationalizing [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1538.16s)]
*  the move in your own head, how deep behind the curtain does a company like Insight allow a [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1544.0800000000002s)]
*  recruit in a role like yours to analyze what it's working on? Right. I mean, obviously, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1552.5600000000002s)]
*  you're going to be very deeply ingrained from day one. But at the same time, they're not going to [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1560.0800000000002s)]
*  have a parade of potential people walking through their labs analyzing the R&D function, right? I [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1566.48s)]
*  mean, there's some secret sauce there. It just makes me curious. How far do you press that when [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1572.08s)]
*  you're looking at a new opportunity and how much do they let you in? Yeah. So they didn't let me [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1579.6s)]
*  do a deep dive, obviously. And they didn't need to because they had presented enough data [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1586.88s)]
*  externally out in the public domain. I could do my own diligence reading up on the data that they [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1593.44s)]
*  had generated, that they had presented, as well as in the space they were competing in. And so [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1601.04s)]
*  that's what I did. So anyone who is considering a move should really do a deep diligence about [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1608.1599999999999s)]
*  the company that they're considering. And when I did that, when I learned more about Insight, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1615.9199999999998s)]
*  it was clear that they had some very good molecules and good products that had [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1620.32s)]
*  a lot of potential. And that's what excited me about the opportunity and really swayed [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1625.28s)]
*  me to come over and join the team. Previous to the three roles that I just mentioned in the [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1631.04s)]
*  derm space, you were director of immunology at Sentecor, which is obviously focused on antibodies. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1638.72s)]
*  I think their biggest claim to fame to date is in Fliximab. That makes me curious how your [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1644.32s)]
*  sort of straddle of the large and small molecule research worlds influences your personal drug [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1651.6799999999998s)]
*  discovery approach or your philosophy. Yeah, it had a significant impact on how I think about [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1661.04s)]
*  treatment paradigms, treatment options for patients. It was my first exposure to the [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1670.24s)]
*  biologic space, and I was able to work on Eustachymab, which eventually became Stellara. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1674.88s)]
*  And ironically, we had a molecule in the freezer that eventually has become Tramfya [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1681.6000000000001s)]
*  that was approved many, many years later. And so it was a great experience, a great company. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1688.0s)]
*  Obviously, they were part of Janssen and J&J at the time. And so getting that exposure to the [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1694.48s)]
*  biologics was very helpful in terms of how I look at things because since I left and in my [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1701.6s)]
*  subsequent jobs and positions, I've always looked at biologics. And clearly since then, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1709.92s)]
*  the use of biologics has grown dramatically. They've really helped a ton of patients. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1715.68s)]
*  And so you really do have to look at biologics and small molecules as potential treatment options [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1723.2s)]
*  of solutions for patients. And so, yes, it had a major impact on how I look at things. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1730.48s)]
*  It also helped me in terms of the differences in regulatory approach for submissions and the data [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1736.88s)]
*  and the differences in the presentation and the testing, et cetera, and things like that. So it [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1743.8400000000001s)]
*  was a great experience, an experience that I'm very grateful for. And it definitely impacted [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1749.84s)]
*  how I look at things and my approach subsequently. Yeah. So given this patient-centric worldview, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1755.12s)]
*  modality, agnostic, I guess, perspective, when you survey the biotech landscape, and when I say [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1764.9599999999998s)]
*  biotech, I'm talking about new and emerging biopharma companies, preclinical companies, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1773.36s)]
*  early-stage clinical companies. We're seeing, it's a trend. We're seeing a lot of companies that are [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1778.0s)]
*  decidedly specific. We're seeing a lot of platform companies coming about where perhaps it's a [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1785.28s)]
*  platform that's purpose-built and dedicated to a single modality. A lot of companies that are [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1792.08s)]
*  focused on very specific indications. What do you make of that? Does that bode well? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1799.6s)]
*  Does it, do you feel like perhaps that platform spinning off products in a specific place [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1806.8s)]
*  approach is maybe a little bit myopic? I mean, what's your general take on it? [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1814.24s)]
*  You know, I think it's very useful to have platforms and technologies that scientists [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1819.6s)]
*  are able to test and clinicians are able to develop. And I think if it ultimately leads to [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1827.76s)]
*  better drugs, safer drugs, I think it's a great thing. But I think as, you know, I think your [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1835.44s)]
*  last point alluded to, sometimes people can just latch onto the platform itself, forgetting about [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1842.0s)]
*  the science, forgetting about the pathway and the disease. And that, I don't think, is a very [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  useful or helpful approach. And the reason for that is you're not developing a platform, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1856.64s)]
*  you're really developing a treatment. And so the platform, if it can lead to a better treatment, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1862.48s)]
*  that is a great thing. But it's not a one size fits all or never should be looked at as a one [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1867.68s)]
*  size fits all solution or approach. You really do, I mean, this is science we're doing, right? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1873.44s)]
*  We, human body is very complex. And so to think that one thing is going to sort of be the cure [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1878.88s)]
*  all for everything is probably not likely going to happen. And so it's a great tool. It's a great [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1887.04s)]
*  addition to the armatarium in terms of addressing and trying to solve solutions or solve problems. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1893.6s)]
*  But I think if you're presenting it as sort of the next best thing since sliced bed, it's probably [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1902.08s)]
*  an overreach. But I think it's an important advancement and an additional tool that we have [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1909.12s)]
*  access to get patients better drugs. Yeah. I want to jump back real quick to some of the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1915.92s)]
*  commentary you were making about your academic years, right? And your moves, right? Like lateral [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1923.2s)]
*  moves, like ophthalmology, dermatology, right? You kind of covered a lot of ground there. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1930.72s)]
*  But when you were considering, back when you were considering practicing, when you were considering, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1936.0800000000002s)]
*  you know, perhaps staying in academia and ophthalmology research, what, when you decided [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1941.6s)]
*  to make the move to industry, obviously you did that for some specific reasons. There's opportunity, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1949.28s)]
*  you know, opportunity to reach more patients, et cetera, et cetera. But at the same time, [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1957.04s)]
*  that's a considerable move. I mean, it's a different world. There are different expectations. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1960.3999999999999s)]
*  I guess the question I'm getting at is like, what were the primary motivations and what were the [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1967.12s)]
*  primary anxieties, you know, perhaps that you pondered before you made that move? [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1973.4399999999998s)]
*  No, it's a fair question. And, you know, I hadn't really hadn't thought about a career [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1980.2399999999998s)]
*  in the pharmaceutical industry or clinical research space. You know, when you train in medicine and [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1987.28s)]
*  when you're doing research, you don't get exposed to that side, or at least I didn't back in the 90s. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1993.76s)]
*  And so during my training, you did this first time I get exposed to clinical research and it intrigued [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=1998.72s)]
*  me because basically you're asking a scientific question, but you're testing it in human subjects, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2006.0s)]
*  which is a very complex and challenging environment to run experiments. And so, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2012.08s)]
*  and as I learned more, I became very intrigued and, you know, I was very interested in the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2017.28s)]
*  and then I learned more and realized that area was a great space to apply sort of the scientific [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2023.76s)]
*  knowledge, the information into human diseases. And that's when I really became interested [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2031.68s)]
*  in a career. And so once I learned more, once I learned about what you get to do and ultimately [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2039.12s)]
*  developing drugs and taking care of, you know, it's great clinicians, you can take care of lots of [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2047.04s)]
*  patients, but in a way when you develop a new drug, you can take care of thousands of patients, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2051.28s)]
*  right? You can help thousands of individuals. And so all of those things sort of led me to make the [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2056.5600000000004s)]
*  jump into pharmaceutical research. And in terms of apprehension, I didn't really have any [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2061.44s)]
*  apprehension because it was a research-oriented job, which is what I wanted, but it still had [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2070.88s)]
*  that connection to the patients, which I also wanted to maintain. And so I, you know, I look [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2076.48s)]
*  back at it. I really didn't know what was involved. But to your previous question, what would I tell [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2082.48s)]
*  myself? I say, this is a great field. You know, knowing what I want to do, what I was interested [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2088.32s)]
*  in doing back then, I would tell myself, this is the perfect role, this perfect opportunity [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2094.0s)]
*  to, based on what my interests were at the time. And so, you know, I look back on it. I just feel [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2102.0800000000004s)]
*  very fortunate to have had this opportunity to work in this space and also very fortunate to have [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2108.8s)]
*  different exposures, different companies to work at, because that in itself also, I think we haven't [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2115.44s)]
*  touched upon that, but every company is different and I've had many different experiences. And so [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2120.7200000000003s)]
*  I've been able to see how companies, different companies approach things, how they do things, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2126.4s)]
*  and that also has helped me in my current role in terms of, you know, managing processes, managing [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2132.4s)]
*  people. And so all of the above, it's been a great experience, great learning, and I continue to [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2140.32s)]
*  learn. I learn from everyone around here and that's what I love to do. I love to continue to learn. I [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2146.4s)]
*  love asking questions. I'm still very curious about pathways and about why things happen. And [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2152.4s)]
*  so this has been a great career move for me and I'm very happy that I did it. Yeah, very good. You [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2158.32s)]
*  mentioned, you know, the desire to impact patients and the fact that you can still do that when you're [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2164.88s)]
*  working in pharmaceutical research and perhaps on a broader scale, right, if things are going right. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2171.44s)]
*  At the same time, you know, when you enter an R&D lab at a mid-cap or larger pharmaceutical company [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2177.04s)]
*  as a research scientist perhaps, or even as someone who's leading those research scientists, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2185.12s)]
*  it can be difficult to maintain that connection to the patient-centric kind of mission-driven [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2191.12s)]
*  mentality. So how do you maintain that and how do you maintain that for your troops, right? Like how [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2196.64s)]
*  do you, you know, I guess it's one thing if you're working in the clinical department and you're [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2201.52s)]
*  making direct connections with physicians and practitioners who are participating in your [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2209.92s)]
*  trials, patients even that are participating in your trials. But when you're in an R&D lab, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2215.68s)]
*  is it challenging to kind of like go in every day and maintain that like, hey, what we're doing is [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2221.36s)]
*  drawing a direct line, connecting a direct line between this important work and the patient [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2226.96s)]
*  community? That's a great point and it is a lot more challenging. So if you're working in a basic [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2231.92s)]
*  research lab, and it is because you don't have the sort of the frequent exposure, you don't have the [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2237.6s)]
*  frequent interactions with people who take care of patients. And so what we try to do internally is to [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2246.4s)]
*  to, you know, always remind people why we're doing this, right? And that's the patients. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2253.36s)]
*  And so just that reminder in itself can have a good impact and remind folks who are in the trenches, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2259.6000000000004s)]
*  so to speak, in terms of the research, why we're doing this and why we continue to work hard [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2268.0s)]
*  and dedicate ourselves to our work. And then we also, you know, try to get people to scientific [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2275.36s)]
*  meetings. Sometimes those meetings will include presentations on clinical topics. And so, you know, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2281.6s)]
*  we can try to connect our employees in that way to the closer to the patient that way. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2290.0s)]
*  And then insight also for our approved indications, we do bring in patients who actually [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2296.08s)]
*  asked to speak to the scientists who worked on the product so they can thank all of the scientists [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2303.6s)]
*  for their past work and continued work on behalf of patients. And so, you know, we take a multi-prong [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2310.16s)]
*  approach to try to help connect everyone within the company to that patient. Yeah. I want to get [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2316.56s)]
*  back to the sort of the strategy at insight a little bit and get some understanding around you. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2324.08s)]
*  I feel like inflammation is a good place to be because it's got so much and it's inherently [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2329.6s)]
*  connected with so many disease states, so many that frankly, insight has a legacy and I mean, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2334.4s)]
*  oncology, for instance, you know, and the understanding of inflammation's role as, you know, [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  a product of or causal of so many different disease states. It's a great place to be. I mean, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2347.04s)]
*  I think generally speaking, but I'm curious about how, you know, the strategy insight dovetails or [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2352.1600000000003s)]
*  intertwines or recognizes common threads of connection between inflammation and oncology [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2360.24s)]
*  and dermatology and even, you know, perhaps some of the other indications that the company has [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2369.04s)]
*  found success in. You know, you absolutely nailed it. There are common threads between cancer [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2374.64s)]
*  and inflammation. And so we've, you know, we've known that for a while. We actually have leveraged [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2382.4799999999996s)]
*  our expertise in both of those areas. And so just give you an example. Chronic inflammation [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2389.28s)]
*  contributes to some of the many of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, the disorders [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2394.8s)]
*  that ruxolatinib is approved for, the oral version of ruxolatinib is approved for, [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2401.2000000000003s)]
*  but it also contributes to many of the symptoms, the skin inflammation, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2405.1200000000003s)]
*  the topical ruxolatinib is improved for. So there's a lot of overlap in terms of the basic [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2412.1600000000003s)]
*  mechanisms that drive or contribute to many diseases that happen to be both inflammatory [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2418.16s)]
*  disorders as well as cancers. And so we, you know, the field has known that. I think we've [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2425.68s)]
*  become leaders in that space and been able to leverage expertise in those pathways, those basic [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2433.92s)]
*  science pathways in the therapeutic areas of both oncology and inflammation autoimmunity. So yeah, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2440.48s)]
*  absolutely. There's lots of connections there. And so we have experts who can tell us and work in [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2448.0s)]
*  different projects that encompass both the autoimmunity space, but also the cancer space. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2455.28s)]
*  Yeah. So they're not working in silos or vacuum, so to speak. There's a lot of interplay there. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2463.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. So you mentioned the first US approval in the Insight dermatology lineup. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2469.6s)]
*  Was the topical JAK inhibitor approved for the treatment of eczema and vitiligo? [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2477.92s)]
*  What's next in the dermatology lineup? What do you guys, to the extent that you can share, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2484.0s)]
*  right? Like what are you guys working on now? Yeah. And we continue to work on ruxolandipramor [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2488.0s)]
*  opselura. There are additional indications that we're evaluating. We've just shared with the [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2493.44s)]
*  external community our results in atopic dermatitis in patients 2 to 11. So we're [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2502.72s)]
*  approved for 12 and above in atopic dermatitis. And we've just completed or are in the process [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2508.56s)]
*  of completing a study in the younger kids. And so we continue to work broadening the age range [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2513.7599999999998s)]
*  as well as looking at other inflammatory skin disorders for ruxolidipram. We have an oral JAK1 [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2521.68s)]
*  specific molecule that we have two ongoing phase three programs. We've just shared the top line [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2530.72s)]
*  results of a phase two program and prorogonadulars, a different inflammatory disorder of the skin. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2538.56s)]
*  And so we continue to invest in dermatology as well as looking at other inflammatory disorders. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2545.4399999999996s)]
*  So those are the main things that we're doing that are going to come up in the next few years [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  for our therapeutic area. And obviously we're continuing to look at other targets, other diseases [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2558.24s)]
*  that we can evaluate so that we can bring better medicines to patients that need them. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2567.68s)]
*  Yeah. Do you have a forecast or any forward looking statements on the role of biologics [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2573.3599999999997s)]
*  and dermatology perhaps? And I ask that question sort of selfishly because the show is primarily [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2578.9599999999996s)]
*  focused on biopharma, right? Like we cover large molecule therapies. We have a lot of vaccine and [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2585.36s)]
*  antibody manufacturers on the show. I'm just curious what role biologics might play again, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2591.44s)]
*  to the extent that you can share. I don't expect you to go too deep into the R&D lab, but is there a [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2598.2400000000002s)]
*  place? Yeah, absolutely. And we're very excited that we're able to acquire a monoclonal antibody [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2604.7200000000003s)]
*  directed against the IL-15 receptor beta. So it's an anti-CD122 monoclonal antibody. [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2610.96s)]
*  We just got into the clinic this year and hope to continue to progress it. And we believe by targeting [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2619.28s)]
*  IL-15 at the receptor, it can knock down tissue resident memory cells. So CD8-positive tissue [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2626.7200000000003s)]
*  resident memory cells. And so that's an exciting target for us. And at least from a therapeutic [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2635.84s)]
*  area perspective, our first four-way into biologics. Obviously, Insight has been working on a number of [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2642.88s)]
*  different biologics. We have a couple, one approved. And so it's nothing new to Insight, [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2647.76s)]
*  but for our therapeutic area, it's our first biologic. And we're hoping obviously to bring [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2653.6800000000003s)]
*  additional biologics forward. And obviously that depends on the disease and the targets, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2660.64s)]
*  because we want to make sure that we get the targets right for the specific disease. But [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2668.3199999999997s)]
*  it's an area of opportunity, an area of growth for us. And so we're excited to have that and [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2673.7599999999998s)]
*  excited to continue to work in that space. Yeah, very good. I warned you that I was going to ask [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2678.7999999999997s)]
*  you a question that's decidedly out of your realm. If I had the chief commercial officer of Insight [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2683.8399999999997s)]
*  on the show, I'm sure that we could have a lengthy discussion about the value of the celebrity of [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2690.24s)]
*  Mandy Moore as a spokesperson for Insight. And I had to ask the question because I'm just going [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2696.3199999999997s)]
*  to go ahead and say it at the risk of, my wife already knows. I mean, Mandy Moore is my celebrity [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2702.56s)]
*  crush. But not too long ago, Insight landed Mandy Moore as a spokesperson for some of its eczema [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2707.68s)]
*  therapeutics. Does that impact even like, does the momentum behind a sort of a celebrity, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2715.44s)]
*  I don't want to call it an endorsement. Maybe it's an endorsement. It's a partnership. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2722.2400000000002s)]
*  Does that trickle down into the R&D department at all? Does it create any momentum for you guys? [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2726.64s)]
*  I think we're excited to see Insight, the ability to Insight to partner with someone [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2733.68s)]
*  as famous as Mandy Moore. Obviously, the primary goal is to increase awareness to patients who have [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2739.12s)]
*  eczema, let them know that they're not alone, and to obviously get them thinking about seeing a [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2747.12s)]
*  dermatologist if their disease is not adequately treated. And so I think it's great for patients. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2753.3599999999997s)]
*  From that perspective, it obviously trickles down to R&D because even though we're in R&D, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2760.48s)]
*  we really do care about the patient. So to see that brings us happiness. But from a direct [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2766.16s)]
*  effect on R&D, no, it doesn't have a direct effect. But ultimately, I think we have 45, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2775.44s)]
*  I think I mentioned earlier, 45% of our revenue we reinvest in R&D. So indirectly, it potentially [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2785.44s)]
*  could. But I think it ultimately goes back to the patients and just the increasing awareness [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2792.48s)]
*  to patients that there are more than just the old topical corp steroids and calcium [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2799.04s)]
*  inhibitors, other topicals available to them. And it's amazing. There's 20 to 25 million Americans [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2804.4s)]
*  who have AD, only about five or five and a half that actually go seek treatment. So there's just [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2811.84s)]
*  a lack of awareness out there. And even among patients who seek treatment, many of them are [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2818.48s)]
*  really not satisfied with their treatment. And so it's really important. We assume that everyone's [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2823.28s)]
*  seeing their doctor, that everyone's seeing their dermatologist, and that's just not the case. And [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2829.44s)]
*  I think having someone, as you say, of maybe more stature to help educate and bring that awareness [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2832.56s)]
*  is a great thing. And just from an R&D perspective, I think it helps us to be more aware of the [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2839.84s)]
*  it helps us because we know that hopefully the drug that we got to work on is helping as many [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2847.76s)]
*  patients as possible. Yeah, that was a very good answer to a question I wasn't even sure I should [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2853.92s)]
*  ask because it was just sort of an ooo shiny thing that I thought, Oh, I got to ask him about [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2858.4s)]
*  Mandy Moore. But you gave a very good, very good response to my left field question, Dr. Lee. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2861.92s)]
*  What milestones are next for you? Like if you look at your immediate horizon in the R&D department [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2869.68s)]
*  there and the work that you're doing, what's next on your plate? Yeah, so it's continuing to [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2875.76s)]
*  develop the drugs that we're working on. I think I mentioned earlier, you know, we're not done with [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2883.84s)]
*  Roxane and LempCream. We're working on the Oral-Jack one. We have this new monoclonal antibody. We [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2888.4s)]
*  continue to look for additional assets that could help patients, right? And so that's really the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2893.76s)]
*  next step is just continuing to do what we've been doing. Always focusing on developing drugs [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2900.56s)]
*  for patients. And sometimes it sounds hackneyed, it's overused a lot, but it is really what drives [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2907.52s)]
*  us, what drives me is, you know, we want to help as many patients as possible, knowing that, you [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2914.56s)]
*  know, we're not going to be able to help everyone, but, you know, if we can help as many people as [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2922.0s)]
*  possible, then that would give us the people in R&D, that's what gives us job satisfaction because, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2926.56s)]
*  you know, as you said, a lot of us, you know, we're sort of working in the lab, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2934.24s)]
*  not really well connected, but when we find out and we get to work on a drug that ultimately helps [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2938.64s)]
*  somebody, it's very rewarding. It's, you know, it just makes you feel like you've really helped [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2944.0s)]
*  society and help people out. And that's for a lot, many of us, that's a very important part of [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2952.08s)]
*  our lives. Yeah. Yeah. I imagine. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it, Dr. Lee. I know we're short on time [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2958.3199999999997s)]
*  here, so I'm going to let you get on with your day, but I do really appreciate the opportunity [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2964.72s)]

*  very insightful, for lack of a better word, and very much appreciated. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qo15bwY9vZI&t=2976.08s)]
