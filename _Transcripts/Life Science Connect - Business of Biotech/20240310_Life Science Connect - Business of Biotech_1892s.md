Video Description: Rob Williamson's mind and hands have shaped more than 20 biotech startups, leading some to IPO and landing others firmly in Big Bio through acquisition by companies like Merck. Hanging around as many successful exits as Williamson has seen, one might become an expert via osmosis. But Williamson isn't passive about honing his vision for progressive therapeutic dealmaking. He's an active leader, and for this episode of the Business of Biotech, he took a breather from a hectic agenda at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference to share some introspection on the work he's done, the work he's doing at Triumvira with T-cell therapeutics in oncology, the big opportunities in cancer therapeutics, and what's coming next.

*  With some 20 LifeScience startups under his belt, Triumvira president and COO Rob Williamson [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=40.16s)]
*  is the definition of a serial biotech entrepreneur. An economist by training, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=47.44s)]
*  he's led companies developing virtually every biologic modality and cumulatively addressing [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=52.64s)]
*  perhaps the broadest range of indications I've yet to see. Why does he take on the projects he takes [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=58.56s)]
*  on? How do his battle scars, deals won and deals lost, inform the decisions he's making now? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=64.8s)]
*  Why does he think he's got a winner in Triumvira, a CAR T cell company trying to crack the solid [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=72.4s)]
*  tumor nut? And with so many new approaches to oncology therapeutics, some disparate and some [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=77.28s)]
*  complimentary, what's gotten him most excited for the future? I'm Matt Piller. This is the Business [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=83.2s)]
*  of Biotech, and I caught up with Williamson in San Francisco to learn about his biotech leadership [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=88.4s)]
*  thought process and where he sees cancer therapy going next. Let's give it a listen. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=93.44s)]
*  Robert Williamson, president and CEO, director of Triumvira. I want to start with you before [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=98.88s)]
*  we get into what Triumvira is doing, because you've got to, I always, you know, I dig through the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=105.44s)]
*  LinkedIn profile and I do an assessment in the CV. And what jumped out at me is very interesting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=110.0s)]
*  is the fact that you studied economics. You worked for Alan Greenspan before dipping your toe into [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=114.88s)]
*  biotech back in the early nineties. So you're studying economics, you know, you're working [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  in the federal government. Just give me a brief synopsis of how you came to be a biotech founder. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=124.88s)]
*  So I was an economist. I was supposed to get my PhD in economics, and I was at the heart of [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=132.88s)]
*  monetary policy. So when you hear the Fed is raising or lowering interest rates, there was a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=141.28s)]
*  handful of people working on that. And I was the junior person in that group. And my bosses all [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=145.68s)]
*  looked at me and said, you know, you can go get your PhD, you can publish, you can go to MIT or [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  Stanford graduate school and get your, and then I said, well, what do I do after that? So you can [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=160.56s)]
*  come back here and do more of this. Or you teach and you try not to teach because you really need [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=165.52s)]
*  to publish. Yeah. I said, that just sounds awful. And they said, we thought you'd think that. So [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=170.4s)]
*  we really suggest you get a business school because you're really a, you're an entrepreneur [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=176.08s)]
*  at heart and you should go and do that. So I went to business school and I got into, I kind of spelled [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=180.32s)]
*  DNA, but I got recruited by one of the big consulting firms and the head of the healthcare [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=185.92s)]
*  practice was in my two doors down my summer internship. And he recruited me to the healthcare [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=192.32s)]
*  practice. And I learned all about pharma and devices and fun stuff like that. Just learned as you went. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  Learned as I went. Yeah. Yes. And you know, no doubt you've already ascertained as we met this [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  morning, but it's already been an actic morning for you here at the J.P. Morgan show. But apparently [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=212.8s)]
*  what's your CV is embraced because you've been 20 life sciences companies that you've either [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=219.84s)]
*  launched, led or directed since that time when you made that decision to come into the space. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=225.60000000000002s)]
*  What keeps a guy like you going? Like what keeps a guy like you going and just doing that over and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=234.56s)]
*  over again and signing up for it? It's a great question because sometimes I ask myself and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=239.44s)]
*  why keeps this going? And my wife is a biotech CFO and she and I were in Hawaii last week and [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=244.88s)]
*  I was getting calls at four in the morning for a couple of different companies working on [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=252.56s)]
*  things we were announcing this week at JPM. And she said, you know, we're going to keep doing this. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=256.56s)]
*  You know, how long are we going to keep doing this? And I joke with her and say, I just want [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=262.32s)]
*  to be involved with curing one more disease and then I can call it quits, just one more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=267.36s)]
*  And you just, when you have success, it's so intoxicating the impact you have that you want [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=271.6s)]
*  to see it again. You may never see it and it keeps you going. But it's just fantastic when you see [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=279.04s)]
*  patients benefit from what you're doing. So that's what keeps you going. And obviously if things [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=285.36s)]
*  work out, you do well economically, you do well, you have bragging rights with your friends and all [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=291.04s)]
*  those things that give you a sense of pride and accomplishment. But it's really, it's true. You [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=296.4s)]
*  hear it, it sounds trite, but when you really impact patients, it's kind of life-changing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=304.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I believe it. Your wife, I'm going to have to take a note. You're not sure right now [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=309.84s)]
*  if you don't want to, but I'll take it she works for, but perhaps I'll have Mrs. Williams on. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  Jacoby, she has a different name, but yes, she was a CFO and another biotech. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=318.15999999999997s)]
*  I'll look her up and hopefully when I ask her to come on the show with me, you'll give her [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=324.24s)]
*  your highest recommendation. Oh yeah. She's smarter than me. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=328.40000000000003s)]
*  The other interesting thing about the companies that you've led is that, I mean, if you kind of [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=333.2s)]
*  tick through the boxes, you've covered all, you've led companies that cover all sorts of [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  modalities for a giant range of indications. Like, and to me, like I'm a very, I think very [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=343.44s)]
*  simplistically, I think, well, boy, your stage in life, having all that experience with multiple [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=350.4s)]
*  modalities, multiple indications from recombinant proteins to antibodies to ADCs, antivirals, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=356.08s)]
*  genomics, like you've covered them all. Now you're at a point where, I mean, the world is [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=361.76s)]
*  in terms of what you do next. Yes. You've got the experience to say, okay, well, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=367.67999999999995s)]
*  you know, I don't want to do that because I don't see that as where things are going. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  So tell me a little bit about that. Why you joined Triumvira? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=376.56s)]
*  You made that decision with a backlog of incredible experience. Why Triumvira? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=385.36s)]
*  More importantly, why right now? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=391.20000000000005s)]
*  Triumvira, one of the key investors I was friendly with just said, hey, we're seeing some [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=396.08000000000004s)]
*  interesting data. A guy like you could help us out. And caught me in a moment of weakness, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=402.56s)]
*  where I was willing to take a full-time job. And so I jumped in on it. And I do have a very broad [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=411.2s)]
*  set of experience. I tend to gravitate towards companies that are close to getting in the clinic [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=419.76s)]
*  through about phase one, phase two. That's sort of my sweet spot. When I was a consultant, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=425.84s)]
*  I did commercial launches and everything like that. But I really, I liked, and I've started [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=431.91999999999996s)]
*  a couple of diagnostic companies, you name it, some tool companies, classic tool companies. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=437.28s)]
*  But I've really gravitated towards therapeutics in that range. And if the clinical data is reading [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=446.64s)]
*  out, or there's thinking to be done on how you sort of optimize the product and get it to the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=451.76s)]
*  patients as fast and best you can, that's where I get the most excited. Why is preclinical through, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=459.68s)]
*  you know, early clinical, phase one, your sweet spot? It's just my happy place. There's a lot of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=466.88s)]
*  prioritization that needs to be done. So if you're a company, you've got most biotechs, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=473.6s)]
*  with really good science have a lot of opportunities, but not all the resources. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=479.20000000000005s)]
*  And you need to prioritize which opportunity you're going to spend your most time on, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=485.20000000000005s)]
*  and what's your second and third. There's a lot of second, third, and fourth order implications [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  to decisions. And it ends up being incredibly strategic and complex. And if you get it right, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=493.68s)]
*  very special. And so that's why I really, and I also enjoy interpreting clinical data, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=502.48s)]
*  my statistician background from being an economist and a statistician, really looking at the data, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=508.16s)]
*  thinking about, Hey, is this real or not? Or what's real? I can be parsed or it's really, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=514.88s)]
*  it's what I like to do. And the flip side is often, there's a lot of partnering and financing [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=520.8000000000001s)]
*  around this data. And the deal making side is the other grades, where my forte can be, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=528.48s)]
*  and the fundraising and the deal making. How is that, that's a segue I can't ignore. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=536.32s)]
*  How has that forte been playing out the past two and a half years when deal making has been [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=541.6800000000001s)]
*  coming at a premium? It's been tough. Right when the market was starting to fall apart, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=547.36s)]
*  I snuck in a hundred million crossover around to our company and got that done. And it was brutal [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=553.52s)]
*  near the end. Investors pulling out term sheets being withdrawn and just wrapping everyone's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=559.84s)]
*  getting an arm in arm and saying, just do this and get it done. It was very brutal. And since then, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=569.68s)]
*  it's been very tough. Not going to lie. That being said, there are certain spots that have been [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=574.0s)]
*  brighter than others. Recently, probably for the last 12 months, nuclear oncology has been [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=580.56s)]
*  incredibly hot. Alpha particles, I'm involved in a public company there. And you just, I've seen [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=588.4799999999999s)]
*  a lot of interest in cashflow and recent deal making. BMS just bought a company for $4 billion [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=597.1199999999999s)]
*  that had only recently gone public at a billion dollars before that was private at a double [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=603.92s)]
*  million. So, you know, just astronomical valuations. So there are bright spots, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=608.4s)]
*  but it's been really tough. And the key there comes back to the previous point I was making, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=613.6s)]
*  which is then you're a company, you have X dollars. You need to make the wisest choice you can [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=618.7199999999999s)]
*  with the money you have and make it and invest what few precious dollars you have in these [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  winter, even these storms, these nuclear winters, as we call them. You have to make the right [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=629.8399999999999s)]
*  choices. And I've been through a couple. So, yeah. Do indication and modality, especially [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=634.24s)]
*  in a time like this when resources are thinner, do those play into your calculus? They do, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=642.0s)]
*  but they also in a way don't. So everyone got worried about small molecules with the IRA act. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  And everyone said, oh, we don't want to do small molecules because we embrace some of this stuff. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=657.28s)]
*  But if you look at private investment, small molecules continue to dominate the private [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=661.44s)]
*  investments. So to some degree, if you are, in my mind, addressing an unmet need and a need that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=666.6400000000001s)]
*  isn't about to be met by everyone else, being the 30th CD19 CAR T companies is not exciting. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=675.2s)]
*  And they've all pivoted to saying, now we're going to do lupus, which has its own issues. So [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=686.1600000000001s)]
*  I think you want to be differentiated, but you can be differentiated in a space that's maybe not [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=690.88s)]
*  sexy right now, but you will persevere and ultimately be successful, I think, if your [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=695.68s)]
*  technology pans out. Yeah. All right. So that's another nice segue to talk about the technology. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=701.1999999999999s)]
*  So I'm hoping you can spend a little bit of time without going too deep into the canned JP Morgan [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=706.16s)]
*  pitch, right? Spend a little bit of time talking about what Triumph area is working on or how it [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=712.9599999999999s)]
*  might differ from other T cell therapies. Yeah. Triumph era is a really interesting technology. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=718.64s)]
*  It's a CAR T, but with a more regulatory built in regulatory mechanism. So CAR T, the T cells that [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=726.64s)]
*  are engineered essentially do not self-regulate. So it works really well in liquid tumors, [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=735.68s)]
*  but they exhaust, they're not durable. And Triumph era out of McMaster in Canada [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=742.8s)]
*  worked on a way of basically trying to mimic natural T cell mechanisms with the engineered [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=749.92s)]
*  T cells that you put back into people. And there are these regulatory domains on the cell surface [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=757.04s)]
*  and inside the cell that they've replicated from a natural T cell environment. And that's keeping it [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=762.88s)]
*  super high level. So it looks and acts more like a real T cell. So you don't get some of the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=768.0s)]
*  liabilities, the toxicologies, and also the super hot and then die that you get with a CAR T, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=773.12s)]
*  traditional CAR T therapies. The other thing Triumph era is doing that's different than most [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=782.4799999999999s)]
*  CAR T companies, or at least historically is going after solid tumors and not liquid tumors. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=787.52s)]
*  There's pros and cons to that. Not many people are going after solid tumors. The reason is [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=793.1999999999999s)]
*  it's hard. It's hard to get the T cells to really get into that tumor micro environment and kill [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=797.84s)]
*  the solid tumors. I think Triumph era has seen some very interesting clinical data and we're going to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=803.6s)]
*  turn a couple more cards this year and see what happens. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=808.88s)]
*  Can you share it all? I don't want to get too deep into the science here. Can you share it all? [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=812.96s)]
*  What the strategy is to overcome that challenge? Is that not being so hard? [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=821.36s)]
*  Yeah. There's a couple of things. One is you hope that our natural or mimicking the more natural [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=825.36s)]
*  T cell response gives you the repeat kill and the durability. We also, and other companies are doing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  this as well, but we're able to do it more aggressively as we can redose with our therapy [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=840.48s)]
*  too. So you have to do lympho depletion and you dose and there's a lot of liabilities with cell [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=846.48s)]
*  therapy in terms of talks, certainly the traditional cartoony of toxicology. We don't [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=852.64s)]
*  have that with our abstract approach or at least most of them. Or if we do see [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=857.84s)]
*  cytokine release, we have very, very low levels of it versus really high. So our therapy is so [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=865.52s)]
*  safe that it can be unlike other cell therapies, it can be an outpatient procedure. You don't have [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=872.72s)]
*  to stay in the hospital or in the ER to make sure you don't have an adverse reaction. We've [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=878.56s)]
*  had patients get it and this mild beer is walk out. So redosing highly safe and the safety allows [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=883.68s)]
*  us to get more cells and et cetera and so forth. So we'll see how it pans out. We've had some [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=892.2399999999999s)]
*  nice tumor responses and we're currently focusing very aggressively on a target called glodin 18-2, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=897.68s)]
*  which is an increasingly exciting target in this space. There's been some data out there [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=905.6s)]
*  with an antibody that's compelling and we're near the front of the pack certainly with cell [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=912.4s)]
*  therapies going after that target. And that's good for gastric and gastroesophageal tumors. It's a [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=918.96s)]
*  very underserved cancer area. Where are you on the clinical continuum? We have a phase two with our [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=924.4s)]
*  HER2 program and we're at the phase one with the glodin program. The glodin program is actually [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=932.7199999999999s)]
*  probably becoming more of a priority given market evolution. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it'll be [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=936.8s)]
*  interesting to watch that phase one. We'll see where Rob Williamson ends up next. It's going to [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=943.1999999999999s)]
*  be interesting 12 months. We'll see. Yeah. You never know. And I'm very excited about that company [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=948.0s)]
*  and I'm involved with other companies too. It's very, for better or worse, the companies I've been [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=955.68s)]
*  helping, some startups, a public company I'm on the board of and Triambir, they're all oncology. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=963.76s)]
*  So I'm looking at it from all these different perspectives, cell therapy, degraders, radio [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=970.7199999999999s)]
*  oncology. And it's amazing when I look at how we're all coming at, all these companies are coming at [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=976.7199999999999s)]
*  cancer in different directions, different ways, but experiencing a lot of similar challenges. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=983.68s)]
*  And the body is incredibly complicated. Yeah. I mean, I'm not going to ask you to [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=990.2399999999999s)]
*  place any public bets, but it's a great point. I mean, oncology is being, [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=997.28s)]
*  cancer is being attacked from so many different perspectives. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1004.16s)]
*  Any, obviously Triambira, any other approaches that are exciting you right now? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1006.8s)]
*  I really like the radio oncology space for probably a couple of years now. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1014.24s)]
*  And I'm on the board of the public and mental perspective therapeutics. We just announced to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1021.12s)]
*  deal with another company today, Lanthias, with a couple of our programs. I looked at radio [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1025.52s)]
*  oncology when I was in the antibody company in the 2000s, where we had very popular areas, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1033.36s)]
*  conjugated antibodies or ADCs, antibody drug conjugates. And we were developing ADCs, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1042.56s)]
*  but we're also looking at conjugating nuclear isotopes onto our antibodies for delivery. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1048.8799999999999s)]
*  And now people are coming back to that again, but now we're using a much safer or better tolerated [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1054.3999999999999s)]
*  nuclear isotopes and people are attaching them to different targeting mechanisms to go after [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1062.4s)]
*  cancers. And so I really do like radio oncology. I think it's gotten very crowded and very frothy [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1069.52s)]
*  in the last six months, 12 months. But I think for certain cancers, it's going to be a game changer [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1077.92s)]
*  in the very near future, which is because it's going to be interesting to see. So I think [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1085.6000000000001s)]
*  a lot of patients are going to benefit from it. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1092.5600000000002s)]
*  Just had a here as a matter of fact, so it'll be a couple episodes before this one airs, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1095.2800000000002s)]
*  ratio therapeutics, Jack Hoppins. It's an interesting base for me because we're [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1100.5600000000002s)]
*  rooted in biologics. I think in ratio space, another attaching radioisotope to a small molecule. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1104.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes. But the delivery mechanisms are... You're just trying to get that isotope to the tumor [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1109.76s)]
*  and only to the tumor ideally. And then you have it kill and get out of the body. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1116.5600000000002s)]
*  There are different ways of doing it. The other really interesting thing that I love, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1122.4s)]
*  and I've seen different companies doing this is it's the same concept, but a different [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1127.0400000000002s)]
*  use is you see so much gene editing going on. And the challenge is in in vivo and the human [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1132.3200000000002s)]
*  body editing. So not ex vivo, but in vivo editing. And there's in vivo CAR T, which I think has [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1139.8400000000001s)]
*  strengths and weaknesses. But the trick has been and continues to be getting that editing [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1144.64s)]
*  mechanism to the right part of the body at the right time, right place. In fact, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1152.8000000000002s)]
*  not only the right organ, but the right cells in the organ ideally. And the liver tends to grab [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1157.44s)]
*  things. So you have liquid nanoparticles, LMPs, and everyone's trying to target those. I think [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  over time, we're going to see... And a lot of people are working on this. Over time, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1169.52s)]
*  the real killer app is going to be being able to deliver that gene editing to the right cell [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1176.72s)]
*  and the right organ at the right time ideally. And that's evolving. I've seen lots of companies [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1184.32s)]
*  working on it. I don't have a clear winner, but I know that that is incredibly important [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1190.56s)]
*  as we think about therapeutic intervention going forward. And there are people, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1198.48s)]
*  a lot of people going after it in different ways, but it excites me, right? When I see a company [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1204.08s)]
*  who's got something, I say, that's really impressive. Yeah. Another answer where I'm [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1208.1599999999999s)]
*  sort of like, you might be going, I see those things and then I get very excited. I get, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1214.6399999999999s)]
*  if there's a startup and they say, oh, we've got this, but we can't raise money. I'm like, here's, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1220.7199999999998s)]
*  go this way, go there and come do this and go do that. So yeah. In the time we have left, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1225.12s)]
*  I know you're on a tight timeframe here and I don't blame you. This is the place to be busy. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1229.84s)]
*  It's crazy. Yeah. I just want to touch on a few more things regarding your, I guess, strategic [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1234.1599999999999s)]
*  and financial objectives. So in your role, you're charged with strategic partnering, financing, [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1240.3999999999999s)]
*  and future IPO efforts for Triumph Vira. So I guess just share with us a little bit about your [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1246.2399999999998s)]
*  strategies in each of those, like starting with partnering. So partnering is great. I tell my [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1253.68s)]
*  teams this, and I've been saying this for so many years now, it gets me down. I say, you can't, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1263.04s)]
*  you won't get a partnership or an acquisition until you don't want one, where you love what you have [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1269.68s)]
*  so much, you want to keep it for yourself. The partners come running in and where the acquisitions [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1274.64s)]
*  come running in. I say, because it's lovable. Yeah. And they sign the love. Yes. When I, early in my [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1279.04s)]
*  career, when I was a junior consultant and the senior partner said, Rob, you got to be competent [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1285.36s)]
*  because the clients can smell fear. And I think in partnering, they can smell success. You know, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1291.2s)]
*  people, we, you know, in a room, it's not what's said, it's what's exuded by body language, by tone, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1296.8s)]
*  by attitude. And so much, when you have something that you know is great, it comes across incredibly [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1306.0s)]
*  well. And, and so that's, that's even more under the microscope in a, in a top market like this. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1314.72s)]
*  Yes, it is. And, and Big Pharma have been calling their own pipeline. There've been reductions. It's [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1322.08s)]
*  changing right now where I think I feel the pendulum swinging, but no one in the last two [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1328.24s)]
*  years would take a risk on an unproven technology. And even trying to clear it, we talk to people and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1333.92s)]
*  they say, we want to do a deal with you as soon as you have unequivocal data, efficacy data in your [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1338.48s)]
*  phase two. Sure. Yeah. And I say, when we have that, we're going to go public. Right. Right. So [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1343.68s)]
*  thanks. You know, if you want to partner now, you, maybe you can get, you can get a, you know, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1352.16s)]
*  a piece of that. Yeah. Yeah. So it's, it's partnering is generally happens when you don't [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1356.88s)]
*  want to partner or you don't need to partner. And that's how I've always looked at it. And that's [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1364.24s)]
*  generally in the, in the market recently, it's been having, I call it virtually unequivocal efficacy [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1370.72s)]
*  data in the clinic, which we haven't had yet. We had a phase one with some intensive efficacy. That [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1377.8400000000001s)]
*  was exciting. Yeah. And really other, other data points that were pointing in a good direction. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1381.76s)]
*  And, and it's probably going to stay that way, but I do feel it's shifting a bit where people may, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1388.08s)]
*  and in fact, the deal we announced today for my nuclear oncology company, the partnership was [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1393.68s)]
*  around assets that are relatively unproven, but they were willing to make some investments to have [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1400.32s)]
*  a first dibs on it as, as those assets mature. I think you can see that happen more broadly as [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1405.84s)]
*  people are willing to take a little more risk and you have to structure it as a win-win for both [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1412.1599999999999s)]
*  parties. Sure. Absolutely. You need to sit there and say, well, we get upside, you get upside. I [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1416.48s)]
*  mean, let's do that. Has that win-win changed like the, you know, are you feeling any pressure around [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1420.8799999999999s)]
*  terms of deals right now related to maybe what you were experiencing four or five years ago? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1429.1999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, sure. It's, it's, I think we've gone and again, I think we went, the nadir is past, I hope [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1435.84s)]
*  at this point. My suspicion is that, but again, I, I, with investors and with partners, I try to [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1442.08s)]
*  put myself squarely in their shoes, understand what they're thinking about and understand what [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1450.56s)]
*  risks I would be willing to take if I were in their shoes. And certainly a year ago, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1454.7199999999998s)]
*  there was an enlarger farmer, there was no risk taking at all. It was on all the deals you saw, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1459.68s)]
*  the few deals you saw were true plug and plays into a commercial pipeline, direct plug and plays [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1466.16s)]
*  where there was a clear commercial path, the Zappar developed, you know, well interface to [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1473.3600000000001s)]
*  data. Yeah. If not on base three, if not a launch post launch and then say, okay, we see a launch, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1480.48s)]
*  we see the traction, we're going to buy that. So, but I do think it's pivoting back and [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1486.48s)]
*  I hope it gets, I don't want it to get too frothy. I don't think there was an overabundance of [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1494.0s)]
*  biotech funding and the like, but it would be good to see it be certainly not a desert. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1499.2s)]
*  Yeah. As it was in the last year. Right. All right. So before I let you go, give us your, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1506.24s)]
*  your best pithy wisdom or advice with folks who are in your shoes 20 companies ago and getting [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1512.6399999999999s)]
*  into biotech foundations for the first time. Sure. I was just talking to one of my colleagues. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1521.4399999999998s)]
*  We were talking about regrets on the walk over here. No, really? Career regrets, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1532.56s)]
*  things we wish we'd done. We'll do an episode on that down the road when you've got more time for [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1536.72s)]
*  it. It was interesting. His was, he wished he had stood up to fight a deal that he thought ended up [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1542.48s)]
*  tanking the company. He was at, but his CEO told him, he thought his CEO was about to fire him. So [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1547.28s)]
*  he didn't speak up any further. My first biotech I went to, I left my high paying consulting job, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1552.48s)]
*  made partner and I left. No one ever makes partner names so I'm out of here. I was the first to do it [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1559.76s)]
*  apparently in forever and it started a trend for a while. And I went to the company and it was one [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1565.12s)]
*  of the first companies to coding the human genome and Insight, Solera and a couple other companies [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1574.0s)]
*  were out there. And within eight months, I helped raise a bunch of money. I'm not bragging, just [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1582.56s)]
*  saying it was that kind of environment. And then Insight came in and put a term sheet down for [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1591.04s)]
*  $415 million to bias. And I thought, this is easy. Yeah. And I was going to make a lot of money, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1594.56s)]
*  have an exit, have a win. And one of the board members said, you know, I'm not going to say who [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1605.2s)]
*  they were. I want double that because my partners and my firm are tech partners and they're getting [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1610.56s)]
*  really big returns. So I want to try to match it. The long story short, that deal went away. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1616.48s)]
*  The next offer we had was half that. And then the board said, can you get back to the first [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1623.3600000000001s)]
*  offer we had? And then there's a drew a chart on my board, which is the downward spiral evaluation [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1627.1200000000001s)]
*  and ultimately just selling it for parts. Yeah. And so I guess my lesson is if you have a deal [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1632.48s)]
*  that looks pretty good, just take it. Yeah. I don't second guess. The other one is when you have money, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1639.92s)]
*  don't think you're going to get any more. Treat it like it's your last raise. But even more [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1645.36s)]
*  importantly, think about how you're going to create compelling, if not game-changing data with the [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1651.44s)]
*  money you've just raised. Like make sure, and you have buffer for failure. And so many biotechs, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1658.8799999999999s)]
*  we say this all the time, but most people, some companies raise and they get these crazy raises [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1666.24s)]
*  and frothy environments and then they just higher up and they get really dopey and they become the, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1673.2s)]
*  effectively, I don't want to say it too negatively, they become the problem that they're [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1680.8s)]
*  solving, they're saluting solving. They become big pharma like as a small biotech. They're not [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1685.1200000000001s)]
*  nimble. They're not making the key decisions on rationing and prioritization. So my advice is [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1689.52s)]
*  always act like it's the scarcity principle. And I had an investor slash strategic investor [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1696.56s)]
*  who probably seven years ago made me buy the book, Scarcity, and say, read this, this is how we want [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1705.4399999999998s)]
*  our partners to act. And it's a little brutal at times, but it makes a lot of sense. And then for [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1710.56s)]
*  often times, bank the money for something not working, if not the financial markets, your [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1717.28s)]
*  science, your technology, so you can live to fight another day. You're picking up on that? Any [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1724.32s)]
*  positive indicators here for the coming? I was on a panel in the December timeframe and someone [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1729.52s)]
*  asked me, what's next? You're going to be like, Rob, is it going to get better than this year? [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1738.1599999999999s)]
*  And I said two things. I said, why don't I feel the M&A is picking up and it has exploded. And I [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1742.8s)]
*  said, I feel like it's going to start picking up. I said, the key for biotech is interest [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1747.92s)]
*  raising to come down. We need to not have another war. That night, I'm also made it as real. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1752.88s)]
*  So everyone on the panel was texting me the next morning saying, I guess we're going to have another [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1760.0800000000002s)]
*  war. And I said, gee, I really hope it doesn't go global. But I think despite the global issues [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1763.8400000000001s)]
*  that we see, and hopefully they stay no worse than they are now. Certainly we don't, Asia, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1771.52s)]
*  we don't have conflict over Taiwan or something. I think we will, biotech is feeling a whole lot [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1779.52s)]
*  better this year than it did last year, in my opinion. And I think a lot of it has to do with [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  the willingness of people to take a little more risk, do deals. People are just, there's more [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1790.72s)]
*  movement. I can feel the gears moving. I think in bathers, we're getting exits that they need to [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1795.8400000000001s)]
*  redeploy capital. So I think we're going to have, it won't be, I hope not, profit, but I think it'll [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1800.56s)]
*  be an environment that will sustain great science. Excellent. Well, here's to 2024. Here's to you for [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1806.24s)]
*  joining me. I know it's very busy. I appreciate it. No, I appreciate it. Thank you for the time. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1813.04s)]
*  It's been a tough morning just with a couple things. I know. We met, we planned some seeds [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1817.6799999999998s)]

*  really cool episode. That's the life. Yeah. You know, like dinner, dinner time conversations between [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1829.6s)]
*  two. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fantastic. So you'd love her. Yeah. Yeah. We'll do it. Well, thank you. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb-T5lA1FSg&t=1834.7199999999998s)]
