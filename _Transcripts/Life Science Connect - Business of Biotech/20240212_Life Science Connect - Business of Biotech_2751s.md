Video Description: The concept of programmable biology is fueling a new breed of biotech, one that requires the marriage of computational and traditional science (and both computational and traditional scientists) on the entire journey from discovery to commercial. Bit.bio is exemplary of this new breed. Its CEO, Dr. Mark Kotter doesn’t pull any punches when addressing the complexity involved in building out the company’s capabilities. At the discovery stage alone, bit.bio has hired – and integrated – stem cell biologists, synthetic biologists, genetic engineering experts, cellular biologists, sequencing experts, data scientists, bioinformatics pros, and machine learning experts. 

On this episode of the Business of Biotech, recorded in San Francisco during JPM Week, we catch up with Dr. Kotter on the work bit.bio is doing, how it’s doing it, and how he and his leadership team are recruiting and retaining a new breed of biotech talent to sustain the effort. Let’s give it a listen.

*  and I caught up with Dr. Cotter in San Francisco to talk about the work Bitbio is doing, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=98.48s)]

*  Bitbio. So let's start right there, Bit.bio. What's behind the name? It's really the convergence of [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=116.56s)]
*  data science and biology. We are dealing with a paradigm of synthetic or programmable biology, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=124.4s)]
*  which has opened up opportunities and solutions to long-standing problems [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=132.96s)]
*  in turning pluripotent stem cells into different cell types. So we're really a cell manufacturing, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=140.96s)]
*  creation, and therapy company. And this new paradigm, this program of biology, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=146.96s)]
*  provides a solution to consistency, scalability, but also even functionality of the cells. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay. And you remain currently a clinical scientist at the university. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=161.04s)]
*  Yeah. My background is actually I'm a neurosurgeon and a stem cell biologist. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=166.64s)]
*  And I had naively the idea of developing cell therapies. I didn't know how hard this is, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  actually, when I started out. And it's only because we were able to assemble a fantastic team [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  that we're actually now doing it. But the ambition always was to extend my medical practice to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=189.92s)]
*  something broader. Yeah, that's interesting. You didn't know how hard this was. You were a [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=197.76s)]
*  neurosurgeon. That's right. How much harder than that could it be? Well, I think the complexities [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=202.07999999999998s)]
*  are very different, let's say. Yeah. What inspired you to become an entrepreneur? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, it was the realization that the means that I have in academia would not allow me [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=214.4s)]
*  to really tackle this huge problem. So there's two things, really. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=227.28s)]
*  Cell therapies for spinal cord injuries were my initial inspiration. I see patients [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  that whose lives change at a flick of a switch. And the only thing neurosurgeons can do is put [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=244.56s)]
*  the bones together. But there's not much we can do to enhance recovery. And so that was really the [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=255.52s)]
*  driver. And I thought small molecules, biologics won't do it. It needs something much more complex. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=263.04s)]
*  And there's been really interesting studies in this field with cell therapies on the [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=269.6s)]
*  preclinical side. And we've seen some clinical transition. Now, the problem with cell therapies [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=276.40000000000003s)]
*  is that they're extraordinarily expensive. Quite frankly, even now, those that work in oncology, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  it's not a good business model. Some of them are still loss making drugs. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=292.56s)]
*  Mm hmm. So that needed to change. That brought me into the idea of pre-botan stem cells. And then [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=296.08s)]
*  also, I realized how incredibly difficult it is actually to control these cells. And the second [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=306.4s)]
*  big thing that hit me was when I was doing my research, like everyone else, we were using [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=313.36s)]
*  mouse rat cells and models. But as a neurosurgical trainee, I was able to access [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  human biopsies. So comparing specific cell types of interest, I found out that they look the same, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=329.04s)]
*  but biologically, there's a huge difference. So growth factors that do one thing of the rat [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=339.12s)]
*  and the mouse have a complete opposite effect on the human cell. And for me, that was like [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=345.2s)]
*  another huge vexation point because I thought, wow, if I continue what I've done before, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=352.4s)]
*  I'm going to be a fantastic mouse doctor. That's really what I want to be. And this really [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=360.96s)]
*  sort of brought me to enter this space. Yeah. And little did I know that we would be able to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=367.2s)]
*  find a piece of biology that is really incredible actually. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=376.32s)]
*  Was Bitbio your first foray into entrepreneurship and biotech? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=379.84s)]
*  It sort of happened a little bit at the same time. We spun out now three companies out of the lab. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=385.28s)]
*  Bitbio is the one I'm sticking to, I'm running. There's another company called [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=394.0s)]
*  Meetable in the cultured meat field. So they also need cells, obviously non-human. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=400.32s)]
*  They need muscle and fat cells. And it turns out this technology is so scalable that [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=409.04s)]
*  they can reach price parity. So that was a parallel thing that happened. The companies [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=416.0s)]
*  initially, you really work very closely together. Meetable are very focused on scale-up, [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=422.0s)]
*  Bitbio are very focused on generation of the fundamental tech. And then more recently, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=428.4s)]
*  the flip side of iPSCs or proprotein stem cells, the in healthy and young state led to a small [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=434.64s)]
*  other spin out called topbio. Okay. Yeah. I've got some questions for you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=445.52s)]
*  on those spin outs, particularly Meetable, very interesting company. But I want to linger for a [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=449.44s)]
*  minute on your transition from practicing medicine and being a research scientist to the business, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=454.48s)]
*  to the biotech business. It's not an easy transition to make. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=462.64s)]
*  A lot of things to learn. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=466.16s)]
*  A lot of things to learn. So share with me a little bit about that. What was, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=467.76s)]
*  I don't know, what were some of the, give me the top three challenges that you faced in [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=471.68s)]
*  deciding that you had science that was worth building a business or what? But how do you do [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=479.76s)]
*  that? Yeah. So let me reflect on what's foundationally different between academia [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=485.76s)]
*  and business. Academia is really centered around the individual. And the questions that you ask [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=495.68s)]
*  based on the funding system that is in place are projects. Now in biotech, I found it's the opposite. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=505.6s)]
*  It's a team sport. The questions that you ask is how do I make this work? So these are real big [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=517.68s)]
*  problems that you solve by bringing together, in our case, really very diverse teams and people [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=528.16s)]
*  that would never encounter themselves, each other in an academic setting. The resources that it [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=537.6s)]
*  requires, of course, much larger and the pressure is higher. So I would say there are, the big [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=545.52s)]
*  difference is team sport in biotech and really a very individual sport in academia. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=555.68s)]
*  Let me ask you to pause there real quick. When you talk about bringing people together, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=566.56s)]
*  creating a team and bringing people together from different disciplines that may have never [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=570.56s)]
*  encountered one another in an academic setting, give me an example of that. Are you talking like [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=574.4s)]
*  technologists or computational people and biologists? So the thing that we needed to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=578.0799999999999s)]
*  solve to create Bitbio, which is a platform that can reproduce any human cell type from [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=584.72s)]
*  pre-published stem cells using transcription factor programming, was, so let's talk about [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=593.2s)]
*  what that actually means. So you can instruct cell identities by activating the right set [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=600.96s)]
*  of transcription factors. That's the foundational insight that can be traced back to the 1980s, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=610.0s)]
*  Howard Weintraub and then Yamanaka, of course, for transcription factors, pre-published stem cells. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=616.64s)]
*  And then I would really want to shout out Marius Wernick and Tom Sutoff here at Stanford that have [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=622.88s)]
*  shown that this is a paradigm that seems to be generalizable. So that's the mind, the framework. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=629.12s)]
*  Now, this framework has two consequences on the discovery side. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=636.88s)]
*  When you think about stem cell biologists, they have been trying to find ways of coaxing cells, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=645.0400000000001s)]
*  let's say, along Waddington's landscape, using molecules to stepwise coach them into a skin cell [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=652.4000000000001s)]
*  or brain cell. The issue with that approach is you never know when you're there. And that's why [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=661.36s)]
*  there's nobody in the industry that has ever created a differentiation protocol from scratch, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=666.9599999999999s)]
*  as far as I know. So industry has taken academic IP and has process developed it. And that's the [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=673.28s)]
*  basis of the many IPC companies that you see. Now, a foundational consequence of this transition [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=682.72s)]
*  to that new paradigm is that you know when the end point is, because you have to find the right [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=692.32s)]
*  combination of transcription factors, and that's going to give you the cell type. So you've got a [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=701.36s)]
*  set of 2000, 2500 transcription factors, and you know combinations of these will create [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=706.8000000000001s)]
*  cell types. And that means you can brute force it. You can build a platform that screens [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=712.4000000000001s)]
*  functional screens transcription factors, and a data science platform that reads this out. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=720.1600000000001s)]
*  And you can then sort of approach and you know when you build this, you can create [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=726.6400000000001s)]
*  new cell types from scratch. And we've demonstrated this in BigBio. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=731.12s)]
*  The other thing that this approach can do is it shortens the time period of the transition [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=735.44s)]
*  from pluripotent stem cell to the cell type by a factor of 10. And it's single step protocols. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=742.1600000000001s)]
*  And the little thing that we developed in Cambridge is using genomics safe harbors, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=749.6s)]
*  we got to a deterministic paradigm. So we can produce cells, batches of cells that are always [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=755.9200000000001s)]
*  the same. So that's the sort of framework. Now, when you think about what do we need to really [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=761.9200000000001s)]
*  build out this platform on the discovery side, we need stem cell biologists, we need synthetic [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=772.0s)]
*  biologists, we need people that are experts in genetic engineering, we need experts that know [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=778.32s)]
*  about the cell types that you want to produce. We need sequencing experts and technologists. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=785.6s)]
*  We need data scientists, bioinformatics, machine learning people. So that's sort of the basis of [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=794.48s)]
*  the discovery platform. Now, one thing that we've learned is you put two biologists together in the [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=800.96s)]
*  room and they're using the same words and the connotations are very different. Differentiation, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=808.5600000000001s)]
*  stem cell speak is very different from differentiation, for example, in the immunology [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=814.8000000000001s)]
*  field. So we're divided by the same language. And so it has, from the beginning onwards, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=820.0s)]
*  we had to really come together and find language to describe what we do as a shared basis. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=829.68s)]
*  So that's the discovery part. Then you go into the manufacturing side, suddenly you've got process [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=838.4s)]
*  engineers, you have people that know something about assays, bioreactors and all of that. Again, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=843.28s)]
*  that's a completely new cohort of individuals with completely different mindsets and backgrounds. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=850.64s)]
*  Again, those needed to come together. And as a business, then you have to have obviously the [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  commercial side as well. So it's been incredibly complex to bring all these people together [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=862.72s)]
*  and align them on a shared vision, but at the same time, give them a language, processes that [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=871.52s)]
*  they can follow in order to build an efficient machine. And I thought it was really fascinating. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=878.72s)]
*  So we sort of did this very consciously, also in terms of how we shaped the culture. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=885.28s)]
*  I was very sort of, I wasn't the English word, I really tried very hard to get to a certain point [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=895.4399999999999s)]
*  and it worked. How did you prepare for that? You talked about when you were in academics, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=903.76s)]
*  you're sort of an island under yourself. And now you've got diverse teams of many people doing many [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=912.3199999999999s)]
*  different things, but having to do it in a unified fashion, and you need to build a culture around [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=919.28s)]
*  that. How did you prepare to, how did you gain that skill set? You're naturally very charming. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=924.16s)]
*  I'm sure that that played into it. But I think that how did we get there? So I knew about the [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=934.56s)]
*  complexities. So I'm a first principle guy. I'm trying to sort of figure out the problem set [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=943.52s)]
*  that's in front of me and then try and find solutions. It doesn't mean that I always get [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=953.04s)]
*  it right. In fact, quite frankly, I think most of the time any progress in BitBio has been based on [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=958.0s)]
*  failure. But that's also a thing. We celebrate that we've learned something rather than that [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=963.76s)]
*  something has failed. So I had certain ideas. And then of course, these were modified through [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=971.92s)]
*  reality and failure. One other thing that was very helpful at the beginning to really sort of [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=981.44s)]
*  put me on to a new sort of mindset, there was an accelerator program in Cambridge that I joined. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=990.0s)]
*  So at least I had some understanding of the language. And then the other thing that happened [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=997.5200000000001s)]
*  was very quickly the idea, you know, the vision of BitBio is pretty bold. I mean, I think it [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1002.96s)]
*  can be incredibly transformational. And people have recognized this. So I was very lucky to be [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1011.12s)]
*  backed by people that have done this before. So one of the first investors was Jonathan Milner. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1019.12s)]
*  He built a company called OutKam. I had angels that had venture capital background. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1025.84s)]
*  And, you know, and, you know, I really, you know, obviously, I was drinking from the water hose. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1034.32s)]
*  But I had an incredible support structure. Until today, you know, my board is, I mean, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1042.0s)]
*  incredible. They're helping me to understand what I don't know. Yeah, I just think you need to have [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1048.08s)]
*  a learning mindset being open. And I love new stuff. Yeah. Yeah. And the community, I've seen [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1056.32s)]
*  having a building a community around you of people who've done it before having that incubation [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1062.96s)]
*  experience. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Excellent. You know, typically, I'm not typically, more [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1067.68s)]
*  often than not, we talk with cell therapy companies, their successes have been in rare and [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1075.3600000000001s)]
*  ultra rare disease. And BitBio strikes me as interesting because you're looking to tackle [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1081.28s)]
*  indications that are far more far more common. Right? Yeah. What's this? Like, what was sort [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1088.16s)]
*  of the intent there? The strategy? Why is that? I think the when you think about the history of, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1093.76s)]
*  you know, stem cell biology, it was always felt that this is this is the key that we need to [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1101.52s)]
*  unlock for regenerative medicine. So, you know, maybe 10 years back, 15 years back, cell therapy [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  was always in the context of regenerative medicine. Then, of course, the world changed with [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1114.8s)]
*  the Cartee field, which became an incredibly effective weapon against cancer. And I think we [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  only start at the start of that. Now BitBio has, you know, embraced this regenerative medicine [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1131.28s)]
*  paradigm. And the way that we look at our internal pipeline is really trying to see [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1140.24s)]
*  what has worked. We need to de-risk clinical risk. If you think about your own pipeline, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1150.48s)]
*  there's of course, technical risk, execution risk, regulatory risk, etc. So, if you take a [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1157.52s)]
*  risk-based approach on structuring your pipeline, what you want to see is patients that have [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1163.3600000000001s)]
*  benefited from a cell transplant, almost. And these cells might have been donor-derived cells [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1169.76s)]
*  or autologous. So, cells that come from the patients themselves. All of these approaches [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1178.4s)]
*  have massive constraints in terms of cost, in terms of scalability. And what BitBio, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1186.48s)]
*  the variable position of BitBio is really that we can produce cells en masse and really democratize [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1194.72s)]
*  access to these therapies. The next line of questioning I have for you was around that very [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1202.0s)]
*  thing. I mean, the cell therapy space has been shown so much promise, but at the commercial stage, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1210.16s)]
*  it's been a rough go. So, unpack that a little bit for me. How the BitBio approach to addressing [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1218.8s)]
*  these indications shifts that incredible cost paradigm. Yeah. At the moment, if you think of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1228.9599999999998s)]
*  Cartes, it's really taking blood from late-stage patients with cancers. You scratch these cells [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1235.6s)]
*  together, you then modify them genetically, you put them back, and you can already see how difficult [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1244.48s)]
*  this is. So, the only way away from this is, at this moment in time, is an allogeneic paradigm, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1250.96s)]
*  i.e. a centralized manufacturing capability. Now, the cool thing is that, and of course, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1261.76s)]
*  that raises questions about how do we match the cells, how we make sure that they integrate, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1269.52s)]
*  etc. The cool thing is lots of progress has been made on this. So, you can either, in the CNS, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  we just saw some beautiful data from Blue Rock therapeutics, these cells persist after a year [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1282.4s)]
*  of treatment with immunosuppressants. So, you've got a paradigm for the CNS. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1289.84s)]
*  You have seen encapsulation, for example, in the context of vertex pancreatic eyelid cells, [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1297.12s)]
*  curative treatment for diabetes. You've seen very enticing data from SANA, for example, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1305.84s)]
*  in terms of the hyperimmune approach, where you take away surface epitopes, and that cells [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1314.1599999999999s)]
*  can no longer be recognized. So, this, together with a centralized manufacturing [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1321.68s)]
*  basis that can really create scale and consistency of highly functional cells, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1330.5600000000002s)]
*  I think is going to be transformative. We think that we can lower the cost of goods of cell [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1338.16s)]
*  therapies by two orders of magnitude. We've got line of sight. And the reason why I can say that [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1345.0400000000002s)]
*  is because Meetable, they're moving to 500-liter tanks. They need to reach a cost of a kilogram [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1350.08s)]
*  biomass cells, it's a trillionth of cells, for $10. Otherwise, they won't be commercially viable. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1359.36s)]
*  Well, that's a good question. Sure. It was one of my questions about Meetable, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1365.4399999999998s)]
*  following on the heels of the cell therapy space, is a pork chop going to cost $3,000? [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1369.04s)]
*  That's going to work. Exactly. The crazy thing is they have a clear path to get there. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  And for a cell therapy company, obviously, you can add two zeros, and you're still in the realm of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1380.56s)]
*  biologics. So, I feel very confident. And that's part of the disruptive power of this approach, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1387.52s)]
*  that we can do that. We will do that. Yeah. Where are you on the clinical continuum? [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1396.96s)]
*  Yeah. So, we're preclinical. The earliest we can go into clinic is about 18 months from now. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1403.9199999999998s)]
*  We have announced a pipeline. So, the first product will be in the liver space. Again, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1410.56s)]
*  as I said, based on something that worked really well in an early stage study, we have other cell [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1418.56s)]
*  types, pancreatic adults. We have various different immune cell types, in-ess cell types. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1427.52s)]
*  And of course, the company is at a stage where we want to augment diluted funding sources with [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1433.6799999999998s)]
*  partnerships. We're a classical new modality platform, very complex, very broad. And of course, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1443.1999999999998s)]
*  if you think about the mRNA companies, what they've done is entered a lot of partnerships to get to [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1451.28s)]
*  the next stage, where they become self-sufficient companies. So, we've already announced one [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1456.08s)]
*  deal with Bayer Blu-ray Therapeutics. We're going to develop T-REX together. And yeah, and now [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1462.72s)]
*  JPM, of course, is a good conference to add to that partnership pipeline. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1474.4s)]
*  Very good. Earlier, you were talking about the breadth of talent and skill, and the need to [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1481.28s)]
*  bring them all together. You talked about beyond the lab manufacturing. What is the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1487.76s)]
*  manufacturing strategy of Bitbio? Are you doing that internally? [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1493.76s)]
*  Bitbio has launched research-grade cells, which are now used by the top 10 pharma companies [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1499.36s)]
*  and considered as best in class for drug discovery and understanding human biology. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1506.96s)]
*  So, we've built obviously R&D-grade manufacturing capabilities, and there are now significant [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1514.64s)]
*  portions that are not optimized. So, that's also been part of the mission, always is democratize [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1521.28s)]
*  access to human cells, close the translation gap, make sure that conventional drugs are being [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1528.0s)]
*  developed with more efficiency. And then of course, on the clinical side, we have GLP at the moment, [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1535.28s)]
*  and we work with external GMP partners as we grow, obviously in-house, all of these processes. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1543.04s)]
*  So, the process is in-house, but the intention would be moving forward to most likely outsource? [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1550.8799999999999s)]
*  At this point in time, we have to, but I think one of the key capabilities of Bitbio is that [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1556.24s)]
*  manufacturing know-how. So, I think that will be part of the business model, is part of the business [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1562.32s)]
*  model. So, we just have to grow to clinical stage before we can justify the investment [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1569.28s)]
*  at a larger scale. Yeah. When I look at the cost paradigm aside, when I look at recent [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1576.56s)]
*  cell therapy approvals, there have been plenty, you could write many case studies on commercial [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1584.72s)]
*  transition failure. I'm wondering, and I know it's early, you're preclinical, but I'm wondering, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1592.24s)]
*  as a leader of Bitbio, when do you start thinking about that? [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1599.36s)]
*  Right at the beginning. Now, one of the things that has been really transformative for the company [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1604.32s)]
*  is when Catherine Corso joined us. She led cell therapy development at Takeda, a very large [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1610.8799999999999s)]
*  portfolio. And she's one of the rare human beings that was able to create multiple products [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  from scratch to commercialization. And she very clearly stated that we have to think about scale [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1628.72s)]
*  and the ability to industrialize our manufacturing from the beginning. So, this is all baked in [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1638.88s)]
*  from the onset. I talked about it, same as their protocols, fully defined media conditions, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1646.24s)]
*  and 2D, 3D transition. And that's working extremely well, plus all the processes, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1652.24s)]
*  assays that need to come with it. So, this is part of, I would say, the DNA of Bitbio. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1660.56s)]
*  If you had to put your finger on a potential rate limiting factor or risk that could [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1669.6s)]
*  slow you down? Sure. I mean, capital is one thing. Everyone has those constraints. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1680.24s)]
*  I mean, obviously, now, we are blessed in some sense that we have a revenue generating business, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1687.12s)]
*  which is going to offset platform costs in the next two years. What's the revenue generating? [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1696.56s)]
*  So, if you go to our website, you can order, for example, neurons, disease models. They have [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1705.52s)]
*  neurons without stem mutations. You have CRISPR ready cells, which are essentially cells that you [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1714.08s)]
*  can put in your culture. You throw some guides in, you've got the experiment. So, it's really about [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1719.6s)]
*  one of the big things about stem cells is that it's so difficult to control. So, we want to make it [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1725.84s)]
*  easy. Anyone can use them. You don't have to have any knowledge. You just take out a vial of [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1731.6s)]
*  our microbe of our cell that are myocytes, so muscle cells. You've got disease mutations, [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1738.24s)]
*  et cetera. And that's how we connect again back to also the rare disease world, where I think [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1750.9599999999998s)]
*  the rare disease world is incredibly rich in terms of scientific insight that you can gain. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  And of course, there's huge unmet clinical needs. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1772.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. So, getting back to the... I have a tendency to just go down to rabbit holes and take it off [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1775.12s)]
*  there. But getting back to potential rate limit factors, we're talking about capital. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1780.56s)]
*  Capital is one thing, of course. What else could happen? We can have... In the clinic, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1785.2800000000002s)]
*  all sorts of things can happen from not being able to recruit patients to holes that are possible. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1792.8000000000002s)]
*  So, we're quite aware of all the risks there. What else could happen? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1804.48s)]
*  I think there are risks around... I don't think we have technical risks any longer. So, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1810.0800000000002s)]
*  one thing that we've learned over the last four or five years is how robust the technology is. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1816.5600000000002s)]
*  In fact, I'm going to just throw out something. We've not had a single manufacturing failure [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1823.44s)]
*  in the last two and a half, three years in a cell therapy product. We've done other things [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1829.04s)]
*  that went wrong. We didn't pack the right number of cells in the vials for our customers. We [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1834.8s)]
*  misladled vials, but we've never had biological failure. So, that's very different, I would say, [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1839.92s)]
*  from any other cell manufacturing company. Yeah. You mentioned, hinted at regulatory, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1848.64s)]
*  when I did regulatory landscape, similar to starting to think about commercial and making [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1857.76s)]
*  out, make sure that you're beginning with that end in mind. At what point does regulatory expertise [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1866.8799999999999s)]
*  come into play? Of course, very early. You have to think about your target product profile, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1875.1999999999998s)]
*  the way, the path that you want to navigate through the regulatory landscape. Of course, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1882.32s)]
*  rarer conditions have an easier path. So, that's going to be the entry, also for our first [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1890.08s)]
*  cell therapy effort. Yeah. I've lost my naivety, I would say. And I've got a team that has [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1898.8s)]
*  all of these things covered. I'm very proud of my team. Just think about who sits on our board, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1910.32s)]
*  Greg Winter, Sir Greg Winter, Nobel Prize for his antibody technology, multiple companies. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1919.6799999999998s)]
*  I think two years ago, the three best-selling products were based on his technology. So, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1927.84s)]
*  he's seen a lot of nonsense and things that can go wrong. So, I feel that the board as a whole [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1933.6s)]
*  is an incredible resource that helps us think through what could go wrong. And I've got a very [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1943.4399999999998s)]
*  experienced management team. What's the funding strategy been to date? We're going to talk a [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  little bit about what's going on at the board. I want to get your sense for the sentiment of [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1958.88s)]
*  the market at this point. But since founding, what's been your... So, the trajectory we span out, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1964.0s)]
*  I had this idea and it was a single person idea at the beginning. And we raised a small amount of [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1972.16s)]
*  pre-seed from people that know what they're doing in the Cambridge ecosystem. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1982.96s)]
*  Then very quickly after that, we had an early stage investor, I think, fantastic capital, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=1993.44s)]
*  DeepTech slash BioTech called BlueYard. I always refer to it as US money in Europe. Super supportive. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2002.96s)]
*  And then another year later, we struck really lucky. I was able to get Rick Klausner, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2013.76s)]
*  Bob Nelson, Jim Tannenbaum, so Arch Ventures, FloorSide Capital, and Euron Milner, Milky Way, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2023.92s)]
*  Rick Klausner interested. And they led our Series A. And that was a big splash. Really allowed us to, [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2031.8400000000001s)]
*  at that point in time, they contributed more than 40 million. That allowed us to build the platform, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2040.16s)]
*  understand how we could create something that can create new cell types and industrialize the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2048.56s)]
*  creation of new cell types. And then at the end of 21, we raised a larger financing, about 140 [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2055.92s)]
*  million. And that was again led by Du Staples combination of insiders, of strategics, Charles [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2066.0s)]
*  River National Resilience, et cetera. So that's given us a good capital base that allowed us to [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2076.72s)]
*  build this. I think we were quite outstanding when you look at the UK landscape. And actually, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2085.3599999999997s)]
*  we followed nearly a textbook approach. You think about platform, new modernity platform, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2094.16s)]
*  it takes a lot of capital to build it. So we're now there. I can say the platform is fully [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2103.52s)]
*  validated end to end. Of course, proof of concept in the clinic is still in front of us. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2110.8s)]
*  At that point in time, we then have to think about non-nilute funding opportunities. So we talked [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2117.68s)]
*  about our deal with Burope and Bayer and our ambition to really increase that now. And we've [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2124.64s)]
*  got a real pipeline of interest. And that's very positive. And of course, we will need [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2131.04s)]
*  further funding in order to drive the bid by to the next level. At the same time, I think [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2140.56s)]
*  from a company size, from a maturity perspective, we're reaching a point where maybe in 18, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2149.6s)]
*  24 months, we'd be ready for an IPO. So this is not to be seen as an exit. I think this is [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2159.92s)]
*  a transition from one capital pool to another capital pool. We've done our homework. We've [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2170.0s)]
*  got all our systems in place. We could jump anytime if necessary. But I do also think that [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2175.92s)]
*  now is time we're sort of actively bringing investors together to finance another round [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2183.76s)]
*  that then sets us up for that next stage. That next stage being the clinic? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2192.7200000000003s)]
*  The clinic and potentially the transition into public markets. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2199.5200000000004s)]
*  Gotcha. Okay. So what specifically is your strategy when you come into an event like this? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2204.4s)]
*  We've obviously lined up a lot of investor meetings. We already have started to engage them [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2210.96s)]
*  since November. There's been education earlier on last year. I think we're in a very good spot at [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2216.88s)]
*  the moment. And we've got ambition to crystallize this in the very near future. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2225.28s)]
*  I want to just jump back to Meetable real quick because I'm curious about from a leadership [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2235.36s)]
*  perspective. You're obviously leading BitBio and Meetable. You founded it. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2239.68s)]
*  I founded it at arms length. There was a very strong tech collaboration at the beginning. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2244.64s)]
*  Naively again, I said, I can translate this into non-human species. It took a bit more [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2253.2s)]
*  than the idea, but I found the teams were able to do it and then Meetable took it and ran with it. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2261.6s)]
*  And now they've got an excellent technical team there. And I've just visited their facilities [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2272.1600000000003s)]
*  and tried some of the products. And it's extraordinary actually. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2281.6800000000003s)]
*  How close to commercialize that? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2288.8799999999997s)]
*  So in terms of they need to get to that next scale point, which is now no longer a biological [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2291.4399999999996s)]
*  question. It's really about having access to the infrastructure and solving some of the things, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2300.3999999999996s)]
*  the distribution of nutrients in the bio-actor. That's looking extremely, extremely good. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2309.9199999999996s)]
*  And then they are launching, let's say early access in Singapore. They're eyeing up the US [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2315.8399999999997s)]
*  now as well. I think the regulatory framework in Singapore, of course, is incredibly conducive. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2326.3199999999997s)]
*  In the US, it's also very positive now. And then once this is demonstrated, I think that's when [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2330.56s)]
*  the capital will be available to really create the commercial scale facility that [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2340.8s)]
*  will drive down costs to the point that it's competitive. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2347.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's super interesting. What's the third company you said that you founded? [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2351.36s)]
*  About Bio. It's really a take on a unique property of pre-reported stem cells. They reside in, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2354.8s)]
*  you could say, a state of perfect homeostasis. They can buffer all the entropy, the things that [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2364.9599999999996s)]
*  go wrong at every moment in time and repair themselves. But the problem is once they exit [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2371.12s)]
*  this pre-reported state, age starts to come in. The repair mechanisms, and I think potentially [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2380.64s)]
*  by design, are being turned off very slowly. And that's the reason why we get gray hair, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2388.4s)]
*  because we have all these things that change as we grow a little bit older. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2395.52s)]
*  We found a way of figuring out how stem cells maintain this useful state. We have a [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2404.8s)]
*  complete, you know, TalkBio is trying to create a complete map of all genes that are involved [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2412.56s)]
*  in the regulation or the repair of what's called the aging hallmarks. And then again, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2421.7599999999998s)]
*  BitBio and TalkBio, both of them are needy hypothesis free, pure data plays where large data [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2428.88s)]
*  processes, they all play a role. Same for TalkBio. We want to understand every gene's relationship [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2438.4s)]
*  to these aging hallmarks and then use that knowledge to create rational choices and prioritizations [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2446.08s)]
*  for interventions that can deal with age-related conditions or maybe even extend health spend as [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2455.6000000000004s)]
*  such. So you could see this is the flip side of the coin. If something went wrong, you need [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2465.76s)]
*  severely wrong, you need BitBio, you know, making sure that things don't go wrong or preventing that [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2471.5200000000004s)]
*  time, pushing it out, that's not Bio. And the magic in the middle is the purpose. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2478.32s)]
*  What is your engagement level with TalkBio? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2486.96s)]
*  So I sort of, we discovered the approach in the academic lab and now I've handed it over [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2489.84s)]
*  again to a team. So I'm on the board. I'm curious of what they're doing, but I'm not involved in the [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2497.2000000000003s)]
*  day-to-day management. Okay. Yeah. I mean, the anti-aging space, I'd say nascent, but it's coming [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2504.4s)]
*  more. I think the biology is solid and it's very interesting. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2514.56s)]
*  What has been the most on this trip to San Francisco? What's sort of opened your eyes [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2520.2400000000002s)]
*  the most in terms of what you're hearing and seeing as you traverse the streets and [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2525.44s)]
*  have your meetings at JPM? Look, I've been very focused on, you know, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2530.8s)]
*  on BitBio meetings, so partnership meetings and investor meetings. And what my take is that [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2535.12s)]
*  BitBio has now reached the visibility that we didn't have a year ago. So you go somewhere and [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2543.28s)]
*  actually people say, oh, BitBio, I've heard of you. And of course we need to amplify this. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2548.6400000000003s)]
*  That's an important thing. The validation that the partnership with BlueRock has provided [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2554.32s)]
*  has also dropped into people's minds. So if you think about it, there are really two big companies [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2567.2000000000003s)]
*  we talked about them Vertex, Bayer, BlueRock, that know something about this space. And I think the [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2573.36s)]
*  signal that one of them has asked us for help has really sort of changed the perspective. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2582.16s)]
*  And so I think that's extremely positive. And on the investor side, look, there seems to be a better, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2591.2s)]
*  you know, the weather seems to be better. And I think that's true literally when you think about [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2600.56s)]
*  the Torrents of last year. [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2605.6800000000003s)]
*  Visible. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJgQy2DB5A&t=2609.52s)]
